Identity, shaped by norms, values, and\r\ntraditions, is the strongest human need, yet often overlooked. It is so fundamental to one’s\r\npersona that it directly impacts behavior and voter decisions. Employing ENODO’s methodology\r\nenables your campaign to:\r\n\r\nEnhance traditional analytical\r\ntools to optimize polling, focus\r\ngroups, and micro-targeting\r\n\r\ninitiatives\r\n\r\nBuild enduring relationships with\r\nvoters based on trust and\r\ntranscend pitches that focus on\r\nfear narratives\r\n\r\nManage and interpret data in\r\norder to allocate campaign\r\nresources more effectively\r\n\r\nFind shared identities between\r\ntraditionally opposed demo-\r\ngraphics to create unanticipated\r\nvoting blocs\r\n\r\nUncover what motivates con-\r\nstituents and forecast how\r\nevents, policies, and narratives\r\nimpact voter perceptions\r\n\r\nIdentify, define, and attract new\r\nvoter blocs and win swing voters\r\n\r\nDesign tailored narratives that\r\nresonate with key demographics\r\n\r\nShape future political land-\r\nscapes and win elections\r\n\r\nTraditional technologies identify issues important to voters\r\nbut do not tell how or why they impact them.\r\n\r\nENODO’s multi-disciplinary approach discovers WHO the target audience is,\r\nHOW they identify, and WHY issues are important to them.\r\n\r\nwww.enodoglobal.com | info@enodoglobal.com",

When integrated\r\nwith irregular warfare disciplines, our analysis provides accurate risk assessments and tailored engagement strategies that\r\nenable our customers to engage local communities, mitigate risks, and direct resources more effectively to maximize returns.\r\n\r\nCollection & Analysis:\r\n\r\nENODO's process begins by collecting data sets from\r\nmultiple sources including: national, regional, and local\r\nnews media outlets; academic reports and publications;\r\nsocial media; and most importantly various human\r\nnetworks on the ground. This source data is compiled,\r\nfiltered, and analyzed by software applications. The\r\nresult-accurate, in-depth, historical and contemporary\r\nunderstanding of the political, religious, economic, and\r\nethnic dynamics within a particular country, region, or\r\narea.\r\n\r\nPopulation-Centric Methodology:\r\n\r\nENODO then applies its proprietary, population-centric\r\nmethodology to delineate key issues and specific\r\ncomplexities in a given population or target group. This\r\nenables ENODO to uncover sentiments and narratives\r\nthat resonate with the greatest segments of a population.\r\nSimultaneously, ENODO identifies the specific, basic\r\nneeds and true grievances. By understanding overarching\r\nand specific challenges, risks, and opportunities that\r\nreside within communities, ENODO sees the world\r\nthrough the eyes of the population. The result is an\r\nunparalleled comprehension of underling social tensions\r\nthat provide the opportunity to pinpoint and mitigate the\r\nsystemic drivers of instability or unrest.\r\n\r\nIrregular Warfare Techniques:\r\n\r\nWhat sets us apart from traditional risk analysis firms\r\nis our ability to apply irregular warfare techniques\r\nto our analytical process. Corporations are at times\r\nunknowingly involved in conflicts with the communities\r\nwhere they operate. ENODO recognizes this and offers\r\neffective unconventional warfare and counterinsurgency\r\ntechniques to understand and win the hearts and minds\r\nof the populations (communities) where they operate. By\r\ntaking an approach that focuses on communities, ENODO\r\ndelivers tools to help companies create and maintain\r\ndiscreet, secure production environments.\r\n\r\nThe definition of ENODO is \"to solve.\"\r\n\r\nOur name and logo embody our enterprise: To solve the\r\ncomplex social challenges that our clients face in today's\r\n\r\ninter-connected world.\r\n\r\nEngagement Strategies:\r\n\r\nENODO's unique process, population-centric methodology, intelligence\r\nexpertise, and irregular warfare techniques develop effective, culturally\r\nattuned engagement and risk mitigation strategies. Our analyses,\r\nstrategies, and persistent monitoring enable companies to create and\r\nmaintain enduring stakeholder relationships with communities where\r\nthey operate. Incorporating ENODO's population-centric capabilities\r\ninto day-to-day operations facilitates the growth and development of\r\ncommunity networks over time. These community networks deliver\r\nadvanced warning against potential threats and safeguard against\r\nproduction disruptions or stoppages, and personnel risks. The result-\r\navoiding negative impacts to production and the bottom line.\r\n\r\nENODO's business is to solve the complex social\r\nproblems our clients face, predict conflicts they will\r\nlikely encounter, and mitigate risk in any market so\r\nthey can maximize profits without being caught off-guard\r\nby social instability.\r\n\r\nPreventing local\r\ncommunity conflict\r\nis a major element of\r\neffective corporate\r\nrisk mitigation.\r\n\r\nM\r\n\r\ni^i\r\n\r\nglobal\r\n\r\nSocieties are the convergent point for the majority of today's\r\nrisks.

    "brochure_text": "HaystaqDNA and Bernie Sanders 2016\r\n\r\nModern presidential campaigns need to contact voters at high volume and on a sensitive timeline; to\r\nencourage persuadable voters to support them, to solicit donations, to engage volunteers, and to ensure\r\nthat supportive voters turn out at the polls. Targeting each message to the most receptive audience is\r\ncentral to succeeding at all of these functions, not only because campaign resources are scarce, but also\r\nbecause contacting unsympathetic voters can produce harmful backlash. Bernie Sanders ran for the Dem-\r\nocratic nomination for president in 2016 with little name recognition, little money, and little support.\r\nWith HaystaqDNA's help, the Sanders campaign attracted the support of almost half of Democratic voters\r\nand a substantial share of convention delegates, and Bernie Sanders was able to bring his message to a\r\nnational audience.\r\n\r\nMicrotargeting and predictive analytics has been a cornerstone of modern campaigns at the presidential\r\nlevel ever since our CEO and founder, Ken Strasma pioneered the approach on John Kerry’s 2004 Demo-\r\ncratic primary campaign. While the Democratic National Committee now offers some basic models for the\r\nuse of Democratic campaigns, the Sanders campaign engaged Haystaq so that it could take advantage of\r\nstate-of-the-art candidate- and state-specific modeling, data-informed delegate maximization strategies,\r\nand experimental design guidance. Haystaq’s models were used for a wide variety of applications, including\r\ntargeted deployment of distributed volunteer calls, addressable television and digital advertising, segmen-\r\ntation of fundraising email lists, turnout tracking, and field program optimization.\r\n\r\n1. SANDERS SUPPORT MODELS\r\n\r\nUsing survey data combined with advanced statistical and machine learning modeling techniques, Haystaq\r\ncreated state-specific models predicting the extent to which any of a sample of eligible Democratic prima-\r\nry voters surveyed could be expected to support Bernie Sanders for president over Hillary Clinton. Once a\r\nstate’s support model was validated and optimized using a test-set of survey records, it was applied to all\r\neligible Democratic primary voters in a state, assigning each a probability score predicting the likelihood of\r\nthat voter supporting Bernie Sanders. To ensure the models remained up-to-date and were incorporating\r\nall available data, they were regularly refreshed to include new data from our daily tracking surveys, and\r\nnew data collected by the campaign’s field program.\r\n\r\nIn some states, Haystaq also created specific support models for hard-to-reach demographic groups such\r\nas African Americans and Hispanics. Those groups of voters were often scored low on our support models,\r\nbut it was important to the campaign to expand its appeal among minority voters, so these models allowed\r\nthe campaign to find which African-American voters, for example, were relatively more likely to be open to\r\nSanders. These were used for specific outreach to those groups, to maximize persuasive impact while mini-\r\nmizing the risks of contacting unsupportive voters.\r\n\r\n2. PRIMARY TURNOUT MODELS\r\n\r\nUsing a similar process, Haystaq also created scores predicting each individual voter’s likelihood of partic-\r\nipating in the Democratic primary. Primary elections typically draw significantly lower participation than\r\ngenerals; they are often open only to registered partisans and even then, only the most engaged activist\r\nvoters tend to participate. In some states, like Iowa, which is always first on the primary calendar, delegates\r\nare chosen not in a regular election but a caucus. Since participating in these contests can require voters to\r\nstay at their caucus location for up to several hours, participation is extremely low. (In 2008, the year of the\r\nlast contested primary on the Democratic side, Iowa caucus participation was a record high at 239,000.)\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY - WASHINGTON, DC - HONG KONG\r\n\r\nwww.haystaqdna.com - info@haystaqdna.com - 202.548.2562\r\n\r\nTo create turnout models for such unusual contests requires a state-specific approach, and is a challenge\r\nbecause there can be no direct source for a 2016 turnout dependent variable before the election has\r\ntaken place. The methodology we have honed defines the most recent similar election as a model. Then\r\nwe “roll back” date-based indicators like age and past election voting history in order to create a model\r\n“predicting” 2008 primary turnout using only what was known before 2008, once this model is validated\r\n(that is, we verify that it tracked 2008 participation accurately), we “roll forward” the indicator set, to\r\napply it to 2016 voters.\r\n\r\nThis is the most valid method available, but it is flawed in that it assumes repetition of past voting patterns,\r\nand no turnout model can be validated until the election is over. The outputs of turnout models generally\r\nneed to be artificially adjusted to account for expected changes in voting patterns. This was especially true in\r\nthis case since we were relying on participation patterns of 2008, which could not be expected to be repeat-\r\ned in part because of the different groups of voters motivated by Bernie Sanders versus Barack Obama, and\r\ndifferences in the reception to Hillary Clinton in 2008 versus 2016. In the case of the Sanders campaign, we\r\nknew that our supporters were much less likely than Clinton supporters to have participated in the 2008 pri-\r\nmaries, and less likely to be registered as Democrats, and so they would be rated as less likely to participate\r\nunder the traditional metrics. For this reason, we also modeled voters’ “self-reported” turnout likelihood\r\nusing responses to a survey question about intent to vote. Our studies have shown that people generally\r\nexaggerate their likelihood of voting when asked, but that a self-reported turnout score does work well as a\r\nrelative measure. The self-reported models allowed us to account for the increased enthusiasm felt by the\r\nmany Sanders supporters who were first-time primary voters.\r\n\r\n3. CAMPAIGN ENGAGEMENT AND OTHER MODELS\r\n\r\nAmong the other models Haystaq created for the campaign were volunteer, email-responsiveness, and fund-\r\nraising models, each of which were based upon individuals’ direct engagement with the campaign. Using\r\nthe voter records of people who volunteered with the campaign's field team, canvassing or phone-banking\r\nto reach voters, we created scores to find people who had not volunteered with the campaign, but who were\r\nmost likely to respond favorably if asked. These models allowed the campaign to more efficiently recruit the\r\nvolunteers who were critical to its field program.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we created “look-alike” models to help the campaign find the people most likely to donate,\r\nincluding multiple versions of this model to approximate the expected value of an individual's donation.\r\nIn this way, we helped the campaign to maximize their record-breaking small-donor fundraising success,\r\nand to expand the program from email-only to targeted digital ads.\r\n\r\n4. DELEGATE STRATEGY\r\n\r\nBecause the delegates that ultimately decided the nomination were, in many states, awarded according\r\nto congressional district (or by precinct in IA), the campaign needed to work to optimize delegates rather\r\nthan total votes. Delegates are often awarded in small integers in proportion to district-level vote totals,\r\nso there are specific times where gaining or losing a small number of votes can make the difference of a\r\ndelegate. Using our support and turnout models, we were able to predict which districts were likely to be\r\ndivided close to these points and recommend that the campaign direct its resources there. The simplest\r\nexample of this is that in a district with an odd number of delegates, the winning candidate gets an extra\r\ndelegate no matter how small the margin; whereas in a district with an even number of delegates, 50% of\r\nthe vote plus 1 is worth dramatically less effort, since the candidates will split the delegates evenly unless\r\none wins by a much larger margin.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY - WASHINGTON, DC - HONG KONG\r\n\r\nwww.haystaqdna.com - info@haystaqdna.com - 202.548.2562\r\n\r\n5. ELECTION DAY TURNOUT TRACKING\r\n\r\nHaystaq also managed the campaign’s election day turnout tracking operation, which involved crowd-\r\nsourcing reports of how many ballots had been cast at particular precincts at various times on election\r\nday and aggregating those reports upward to project voting trends. Precincts were categorized according\r\nto the average support score of eligible primary voters as favorable to Clinton or Sanders. Our turnout\r\ntracking system compared the actual number of ballots cast at base Sanders and Clinton precincts to the\r\nbaseline expectation during the day to give the campaign an indication of whether it was likely to win the\r\nstate, and then perhaps more importantly, how delegates apportioned at district levels were likely to be\r\ndistributed. This allowed the campaign to direct its resources to the places where additional campaign\r\nphone calls or canvassing were most likely to make a difference in the delegate total.\r\n\r\n6. FUNDRAISING MODELS\r\n\r\nHaystaq and the campaign also conducted a series of experiments aimed at optimizing the response to its\r\nfundraising emails by varying the “ask amount” referenced in the email text. In general, asking for larger\r\ndonations does yield larger donations, but asking for smaller donations yields more donations. We found\r\nin a series of A/B tests conducted in early April that asking people who had not previously contributed to\r\nthe campaign for $2.70 (1/10 the campaign’s oft-cited average contribution of $27) consistently pro-\r\nduced a higher expected return than the campaign’s original practice of asking for $3. While the average\r\ndonation amount decreased marginally with the smaller ask, this effect was moderated by the fact that\r\npeople often donated more than the amount asked for once they reached the donation page.\r\n\r\nEvery victory we earn is extraordinarily important for our political\r\nrevolution. Not just because of the delegates we earn, but because each win\r\nand all the work that goes into that effort sends an unmistakable message to\r\nthe establishment of this country that we will never stop fighting for the values\r\nwe share. I say we keep fighting. Are you with me?\r\n\r\nYour $2.70 contribution to our campaign sends a powerful message that\r\n\r\nwe will fight for the values we share all the wav through the Democratic\r\n\r\nconvention and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe next states up are West Virginia, Kentucky and Oregon. They are all places\r\nwe have a chance to do very well. I am in this fight through the Democratic\r\nconvention. Thank you for standing with me.\r\n\r\nIn solidarity,\r\nBemie Sanders\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTE\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY - WASHINGTON, DC - HONG KONG\r\n\r\nwww.haystaqdna.com - info@haystaqdna.com - 202.548.2562\r\n\r\n7. DIRECT MAIL\r\n\r\nHaystaq microtargeting models allowed for the creation of nuanced and very precisely targeted direct\r\nmail universes. We were able to increase the volume of mail sent to precincts or congressional districts\r\nwhere our modeling showed that the campaign was near the tipping point for winning additional dele-\r\ngates, and also to target specific messages to voters most likely to be sympathetic. Using a suite of more\r\nthan 50 issues ranging from climate change to school choice support, we were able to direct messaging\r\non climate change, for example, to the voters most likely to strongly agree with Sanders' climate message.\r\nWe were also able to direct additional mail to individuals with low television viewing or low social media\r\nusage scores, improving reach among voters unlikely to see the campaign’s messaging in other media.\r\n\r\n8. TELEVISION TARGETING\r\n\r\nMicrotargeting is often thought of as a tool only for direct voter contact like phones, door knocking or direct\r\nmail. However, given the share of resources spent on television advertising, this may be the most important\r\napplication of microtargeting. Haystaq used ratings data by various different demographic and lifestyle indi-\r\ncators to calculate the likelihood of any individual voter watching a particular show, network or daypart. We\r\nthen overlaid this data with our modeled lists of persuadable voters and likely supporters to calculate the\r\ncost of reaching any one of the campaign’s targets via television. This often led to our being able to identify\r\nmuch more efficient targets than would have been possible using traditional metrics like cost per point or\r\ncost per adult viewer.\r\n\r\nEven greater precision was available through addressable television. We generated lists of individuals who\r\nwere scored as highly persuadable for persuasion ads, and likely supporters who might not vote for turnout\r\nads. These were also segmented by demographics and by congressional district so that we could maximize\r\nthe ad spend in districts where we were the closest to the tipping point for winning additional delegates.\r\n\r\nRESULTS\r\n\r\nWhile ultimately Sanders narrowly lost the nomination, the campaign dramatically outperformed\r\nexpectations at its launch, engaged segments of voters previously ignored by the Democratic Party, and\r\neventually garnered the support of 47% of Democrats. The campaign resulted in the elevation of Sand-\r\ners’ stature within the party and an ongoing engagement for Haystaq with the campaign’s successor\r\norganization Our Revolution.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY - WASHINGTON, DC -\r\n\r\nwww.haystaqdna.com - info@haystaqdna.com\r\n\r\nHONG KONG\r\n\r\n202.548.2562",

Research conducted by HaystaqDNA during the 2016 campaign showed that\r\na majority of Americans support the ACA However, members of Congress are more concerned with opinions of\r\ntheir constituents than they are with national numbers. Therefore, Haystaq looked at support levels by Congres-\r\nsional District. 253 of 435 or 58% of Congressional Districts show a majority of voters supporting ACA.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, the majority of these pro-ACA districts are held by Democrats. However, 61 pro-ACA\r\ndistricts are currently held by Republicans. Many of these districts are relatively safely Republican, but in\r\nmany, the difference in support in favor of the ACA is near or above the margin of victory in the 2016 elec-\r\ntion. This would suggest that voting to repeal the act puts these candidates at risk next year, even more so\r\nonce voters realize how they will be personally affected by a repeal of the ACA.\r\n\r\nThe Haystaq microtargeting models have identified 98,942,762 likely ACA supporters nationwide,\r\n41,697,492 of whom live in Republican districts.\r\n\r\nMETHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nThese numbers are based on a national survey of approximately 10,000 registered voters. The survey\r\nresponses were used to build microtargeting models predicting how any individual voter would have an-\r\nswered the question had they been surveyed. The Congressional District percent in support of ACA is based\r\non the number of voters in each district with an ACA support score of 50% or higher. The ACA support score\r\npredicts the likelihood that a voter would say that they support the ACA if surveyed. These numbers differ\r\nfrom poll results in that they are not weighted. A poll is likely to be weighted based on assumptions about\r\nlikely turnout. The Haystaq models are applied to every registered voter.\r\n\r\nThe microtargeting models were built using a combination of the survey results and nearly 1,000 fields of\r\ncommercial marketing data, Census demographics and proprietary derived indicators. Haystaq combines a\r\nvariety of statistical and machine learning algorithms including Penalized Logistic Regression and Random\r\nForests. The predictive models were validated against a hold-out sample to confirm that they accurately\r\npredicted the likely survey responses of individuals whose responses were not used in building the models.\r\n\r\nFollowing is the question wording used in the survey:\r\n\r\nWhich comes closest to your opinion on the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare: that it is beneficial but\r\ndoesn't go far enough, that it is about right, or that it goes too far and should be repealed? Please press\r\n1 if you think Obamacare is beneficial but doesn't go far enough, press 2 if you like the law as it is, press\r\n3 if you think Obamacare goes too far and should be repealed, or press 4 if you are not sure.\r\n\r\nThe model predicts the likelihood that a voter with an opinion on ACA would select option 1 (Support ACA\r\nbut thinks it doesn't go far enough) or option 2 (like the law as it is) vs. 3 (Goes too far and should be\r\nrepealed). Because the model is predicting support only among those with an opinion, respondents picking\r\noption 4 (unsure) are not included.\r\n\r\nThe survey was conducted using a combination of live and IVR (automated phone calls) to a random\r\nsample of more than 10,000 voters nationwide.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY - WASHINGTON, DC - HONG KONG\r\nwww.haystaqdna.com - info@haystaqdna.com - 202.548.2562\r\n\r\nTABLE 1: REPUBLICAN DISTRICTS WITH MAJORITY APPROVAL OF ACA\r\n\r\nCD\tNAME\t% OF VOTE IN 2016 ELECTION\t% OF VOTERS SUPPORTING ACA\r\nTX23\tWill Hurd\t50.9%\t72.4%\r\nNY11\tDaniel Donovan\t63.3%\t70.4%\r\nFL27\tIleana Ros-Lehtinen\t54.9%\t67.2%\r\nFL26\tCarlos Curbelo\t56.3%\t65.3%\r\nWA8\tDave Reichert\t60.0%\t64.9%\r\nCA21\tDavid G.

However, the most recent election marked a critical turning point, as candidates, political\r\naction committees, and other interest groups were able to take advantage of significant\r\n\r\nInternet Policy Review | http://policyreview.info\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nDecember 2017 | Volume 6 | Issue 4\r\n\r\nThe role of digital marketing in political campaigns\r\n\r\nbreakthroughs in data-driven marketing techniques, such as cross-device targeting, developed\r\nsince the previous presidential election (“Bernie Sanders”, 2016; Edelman Digital, 2016).\r\nElectoral politics has now become fully integrated into a growing, global commercial digital\r\nmedia and marketing ecosystem that has already transformed how corporations market their\r\nproducts and influence consumers (Chahal, 2013; LiveRamp, 2015; Rubinstein, 2014; Schuster,\r\n2015).The strategies, technologies, and tools of digital political marketing are more complex and\r\nfar-reaching than anything we have seen before, with further innovations already underway\r\n(WARC, 2017). But because most commercial and political digital operations take place below\r\nthe radar, they are not fully understood by the public. 1\r\n\r\nIn the following pages, we briefly describe the growth and maturity of digital marketing,\r\nhighlighting its basic features, key players, and major practices. We then document how data-\r\ndriven digital marketing has moved into the centre of American political operations, along with\r\na growing infrastructure of specialised firms, services, technologies and software systems. We\r\nidentify the prevailing digital strategies, tactics, and techniques of today’s political operations,\r\nexplaining how they were employed during the most recent US election cycle. Finally, we\r\nexplore the implications of their use for democratic discourse and governance, discussing\r\nseveral recent policy developments aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in\r\ndigital politics.\r\n\r\nOur research for this paper draws from our extensive experience tracking the growth of digital\r\nmarketing over the past two decades in the United States and abroad, monitoring and analysing\r\nkey technological developments, major trends, practices and players, and assessing the impact\r\nof these systems in areas such as health, financial services, retail, and youth (Chester, 2007;\r\nMontgomery, 2007; Montgomery, Chester, & Kopp, 2017). During the 2016 US presidential\r\nelection, we monitored commercial digital advertising and data use by candidates, parties and\r\nspecial interest groups across the political spectrum. We collected examples of these ads, along\r\nwith technical and market impact information from the developers of the applications. We also\r\nreviewed trade journals, research reports, and other industry documents, and attended\r\nconferences that were focused on digital technologies and politics. In the process, we identified\r\nall of the major providers of political digital data targeting applications (e.g., Google, Facebook,\r\ndata clouds, ad agencies) and analysed all their key materials and case studies related to their\r\n2016 operations. The source for much of this work was our ongoing gathering and analysis of\r\ncross-sectional commercial digital marketing practices worldwide.\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE OF POLITICS AND COMMERCE\r\n\r\nSince the mid-20th century, advertising has been an increasingly powerful and pervasive\r\npresence in US political campaigns, as a growing cadre of ad agencies, public relations firms,\r\nand consultants perfected the use of opinion polls, focus groups, and psychographics to reach\r\nand influence voters through radio, television, direct mail, and other media outlets (A.\r\nJamieson, 2016; K. H. Jamieson, 1996; Sabato, 1981). With the rise of the internet, campaign\r\noperatives began to harness digital technologies and tools to mobilize voter turnout, engage\r\nyoung people, raise money, and support grassroots ground operations (Karpf, 2016; Kreiss,\r\n2016; Tufecki, 2014). Both major political parties in the United States developed large,\r\nsophisticated data and digital operations (Kreiss, 2016).\r\n\r\nMany of the digital strategies, tools, and techniques employed in the 2016 election were initially\r\ndeveloped, deployed, tested, and refined by the commercial sector (Tufecki, 2014). Since its\r\n\r\nInternet Policy Review | http://policyreview.info\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nDecember 2017 | Volume 6 | Issue 4\r\n\r\nThe role of digital marketing in political campaigns\r\n\r\norigins in the mid-1990s, digital marketing has operated with a core business model that relies\r\non continuous data collection and monitoring of individual online behaviour patterns\r\n(Montgomery, 2011). This system emerged in the United States amid a political culture of\r\nminimal government interference, and within a prevailing laissez-faire ethos regarding the\r\ninternet and new technologies (Barlow, 1996). In the earliest days of the “dot-com boom”, a\r\nstrong political alliance was forged between the digital media companies and their partners in\r\nthe advertising and media business, enabling the nascent industry to effectively ward off any\r\nattempts to restrain its business operations through privacy regulation or other public policies\r\n(Solon & Siddiqui, 2017). As a consequence, the advertising industry played a central role in\r\nshaping the operations of platforms and applications in the digital media ecosystem. Digital\r\nmarketing is now well established and thriving, with expenditures reaching nearly $72.5bn in\r\n2016 for the US alone, and worldwide spending predicted to reach more than $223bn this year\r\n(eMarketer, 2017; IAB, n.d.-d).\r\n\r\nOngoing innovations over the years have increased the capacity of data and digital marketing\r\napplications. Data collection, analysis, and targeting were further woven into the daily lives of\r\nconsumers with the rise of social media platforms and mobile devices. Because of the unique\r\nrole that they play in users’ lives, these platforms are able to sweep up enormous amounts of\r\ninformation, including not only what users post about themselves, but also what is collected\r\nfrom them throughout their daily activities (Smith, 2014). A growing arsenal of software and\r\nanalytic tools has enhanced the ability of digital media companies and their advertisers to glean\r\nvaluable insights from the oceans of data they generate (Smith, 2014). Predictive analytics\r\nintroduced an expanded set of tools for scoring, rating, and categorising individuals, based on\r\nan increasingly granular set of behavioural, demographic, and psychographic data (“What is\r\nPredictive Intelligence”, 2017). US digital marketers have helped popularise and spur the\r\nsuccessful adoption of digital advertising platforms and applications in nearly every\r\ngeographical location with an internet connection or a link to a mobile device (IAB, n.d.-c).\r\nGoogle, Facebook, and other major players in the digital marketing industry have also developed\r\na global research infrastructure to allow them, and especially their major advertising clients, to\r\nmake continuous improvements in reaching and influencing the public, and to measure with\r\nincreasing accuracy the success of their efforts (Facebook IQ, n.d.-a). These developments have\r\ncreated what some observers have called the “surveillance economy” (Singer, 2012).\r\n\r\nTHE GROWTH OF DATA-DRIVEN POLITICAL\r\nMARKETING\r\n\r\nThough political campaigns have employed micro-targeting techniques—which use an array of\r\npersonalised and other data sets and marketing applications to influence the actions of\r\nindividuals—during the last several election cycles, recent technological innovations and\r\nindustry advances have created a much more robust system than what was in place in 2012\r\n(IAB, n.d.-b; Rubinstein, 2014). For years, political campaigns have been able to combine public\r\nvoter files with commercial information from data brokers, to develop detailed and\r\ncomprehensive dossiers on American voters (Rubinstein, 2014). With recent advances in the\r\nadvertising technology and data industries, they can now take advantage of a growing\r\ninfrastructure of specialty firms offering more extensive resources for data mining and targeting\r\nvoters. Among the new entities are data marketing clouds. Developed by well-known companies\r\nsuch as Adobe, Oracle, Salesforce, Nielsen, and IBM, these clouds sell political data along with\r\nan exhaustive amount of detailed consumer information for each potential target, including, for\r\n\r\nInternet Policy Review | http://policyreview.info\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nDecember 2017 | Volume 6 | Issue 4\r\n\r\nThe role of digital marketing in political campaigns\r\n\r\nexample, credit card use, personal interests, consumption patterns, and TV viewing patterns\r\n(Salesforce DMP, 2017).\r\n\r\nSome of these massive cloud services also operate what has become a new and essential\r\ncomponent for contemporary digital targeting—the data management platform (DMP) (Chavez,\r\n2017). DMPs provide marketers with “centralized control of all of their audience and campaign\r\ndata” (BlueKai, 2011). They do this by collecting and analysing data about individuals from a\r\nwide variety of online and offline sources, including first-party data from a customer’s own\r\nrecord, such as the use of a supermarket loyalty card, or their activities captured on a website,\r\nmobile phone, or wearable device; second-party data, information collected about a person by\r\nanother company, such as an online publisher, and sold to others; and third-party data drawn\r\nfrom thousands of sources, comprising demographic, financial, and other data-broker\r\ninformation, including race, ethnicity, and presence of children (O’Hara, 2016). All of this\r\ninformation can be matched to create highly granular “target audience segments” and to identify\r\nand “activate” individuals “across third party ad networks and exchanges”. DMPs are quickly\r\nbecoming a critical tool for political campaigns (Bennett, 2016; Kaye, 2016, July; Regan, J.,\r\n2016).\r\n\r\nFacebook and Google now play a central role in political operations, offering a full spectrum of\r\ncommercial digital marketing tools and techniques, along with specialied ad “products”\r\ndesigned for political use (Bond, 2017). Not surprisingly, these companies have also made\r\ngenerating revenues from political campaigns an important “vertical” category within their ad\r\nbusiness (Facebook, n.d.-d; Facebook IQ, n.d.-b; Stanford, 2016). Facebook’s role in the 2016\r\nelection was particularly important. With users required to give their real names when they sign\r\nup as members, Facebook has created a powerful “identity-based” targeting paradigm, enabling\r\npolitical campaigns to access its more than 162 million US users and to target them individually\r\nby age, gender, congressional district, and interests (Facebook, n.d.-b).Its online guide for\r\npolitical campaign marketing urges political campaigns to use all the social media platform tools\r\nit makes available to advertisers—including through Instagram and other properties—in order\r\nto track individuals, capture their data through various “lead-generation” tactics, and target\r\nthem by uploading voter files and other data (Facebook, n.d.-a-c-f). The company also employs\r\nteams of internal staff aligned with each of the major political parties to provide technical\r\nassistance and other services to candidates and their campaigns (Chester, 2017; Kreiss &\r\nMcgregor, 2017). Google heavily promoted the use of YouTube, as well as its other digital\r\nmarketing assets, during the 2016 US election, reaching out to both major political parties\r\n(YouTube, 2017).\r\n\r\nThe growth and increasing sophistication of the digital marketplace has enhanced the capacities\r\nof political campaigns to identify, reach, and interact with individual voters. Below we identify\r\nseven key techniques that are emblematic of this new digital political marketing system,\r\nproviding brief illustrations of how they were employed during the 2016 election.\r\n\r\nCROSS-DEVICE TARGETING\r\n\r\nGetting a complete picture of a person’s persistent “identity” through an “identity-graph” has\r\nbecome a key strategy for successfully reaching consumers across their “omnichannel”\r\nexperience (use of mobile, TV, streaming devices, etc.) (Winterberry Group, 2016). “Cross-\r\ndevice recognition” allows marketers to determine if the same person who is on a social network\r\nis also using a personal computer and later watching video on a mobile phone. Through data\r\n“onboarding,” a customer record that may contain a physical and email address is linked\r\nthrough various matching processes, associating it with what is believed to be that individual’s\r\n\r\nInternet Policy Review | http://policyreview.info\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nDecember 2017 | Volume 6 | Issue 4\r\n\r\nThe role of digital marketing in political campaigns\r\n\r\nonline identification-cookies, IP addresses, and other persistent identifiers (Levine, 2016).\r\nCross-device targeting is now a standard procedure for political initiatives and other campaigns.\r\nVoter files are uploaded into the onboarding process, enabling the campaigns to find their\r\ntargets on mobile devices and at specific times when they may be more receptive to a message\r\n(Kaye, 2016, April; L2, n.d.-b). Such granularity of information also enables a more tailored\r\nadvertisement—so-called “dynamic creative”—which can be changed over time to “deliver very\r\nspecific messaging” to individuals (Schuster, 2015). Leading cross-device marketing company\r\nDrawbridge offered a suite of election services in 2016 that provided campaigns a number of\r\nways to impact voters, including through “Voter-Centric Cross Device Storytelling”, “Political\r\nInfluencer Identification”, and via “Real-Time Voter Attribution Measurement” (Drawbridge,\r\nn.d.).\r\n\r\nPROGRAMMATIC ADVERTISING\r\n\r\nProgrammatic advertising refers to new automated forms of ad buying and placement on digital\r\nmedia using computer programmes and algorithmic processes to find and target a customer\r\nwherever she goes. The process can also involve real-time “auctions” that occur in milliseconds\r\nin order to “show an ad to a specific customer, in a specific context” (Allen, 2016). The use of\r\nprogrammatic advertising was one of the major changes in political campaign digital operations\r\nbetween 2012 and 2016—“the first time in American History”, according to one ad company,\r\n“that such precise targeting has ever been made available at such great scale” (Briscoe, 2017;\r\nKaye, 2015). Programmatic advertising has itself grown in its capabilities to reach individuals,\r\ntaking advantage of new sources of data to reach them on all of their devices (Regan, T., 2016).\r\nIn 2016, for example, global ad giant WPP’s Xaxis system—“the world’s largest programmatic\r\nand technology platform”—launched “Xaxis Politics”. Capable of “reaching US voters across all\r\ndigital channels”. the system is said to “segment audiences by hundreds of hot button issues as\r\nwell as by party affiliation”, including via “real-time campaigns tied to specific real-world\r\nevents” (Xaxis, 2015). Candidates were able to use the services of a growing list of companies,\r\nincluding Google, Rubicon, AOL, PubMatic, Appnexus and Criteo, that offered programmatic\r\nadvertising platforms (“Political Campaigns”, 2016; Yatrakis, 2016).\r\n\r\nLOOKALIKE MODELLING\r\n\r\nThe use of big data analytics enables marketers to acquire information about an individual\r\nwithout directly observing behaviour or obtaining consent. They do this by “cloning” their “most\r\nvaluable customers”in order to identify and target other prospective individuals for marketing\r\npurposes (LiveRamp, 2015). For example, Stirista (n.d.), a digital marketing firm that also\r\nserves the political world, offers lookalike modelling to identify people who are potential\r\nsupporters and voters. The company claims it has matched 155 million voters to their “email\r\naddresses, online cookies, and social handles”, as well as “culture, religion, interests, political\r\npositions and hundreds of other data points to create rich, detailed voter profiles”. Facebook\r\noffers a range of lookalike modelling tools through its “Lookalike Audiences” ad platform. For\r\nexample, Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign’s digital director, used the Lookalike Audiences ad\r\ntool to “expand” the number of people the campaign could target (Green & Issenberg, 2016).\r\nFacebook’s “Custom Audiences” product, similarly, enables marketers to upload their own data\r\nfiles so they can be matched and then targeted to Facebook users (Facebook, n.d.-e).\r\n\r\nGEOLOCATION TARGETING\r\n\r\nMobile devices continually send signals that enable advertisers (and others) to take advantage of\r\nan individual’s location—through the phone’s GPS (global positioning system), Wi-Fi, and\r\nBluetooth communications. All of this can be done with increasing speed and efficiency.\r\nThrough a host of new location-targeting technologies, consumers can now be identified and\r\n\r\nInternet Policy Review | http://policyreview.info\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nDecember 2017 | Volume 6 | Issue 4\r\n\r\nThe role of digital marketing in political campaigns\r\n\r\ntargeted wherever they go, while driving a car, pulling into a mall, or shopping in a store (Son,\r\nKim, & Shmatikov, 2016). A complex and growing infrastructure of geolocation-based data-\r\nmarketing services has emerged, with specialised mobile data firms, machine-learning\r\ntechnologies, measurement companies, and new technical standards to facilitate on-the-go\r\ntargeting (Warrington, 2015). The use of mobile geo-targeting techniques played a central role\r\nin the 2016 election cycle, with a growing number of specialists offering their services to\r\ncampaign operatives. For example, L2 (n.d.-a) made its voter file, along with HaystaqDNA\r\nmodelling data, available for mobile device targeting, offering granular profile data on voters\r\nbased on their interest in such contested topics as gun laws, gay marriage, voter fraud, and\r\nschool choice, among others. Conde Nast’s Advance Publications’ election advertising worked\r\nwith campaigns to append geo-location, profile data, and buying behaviour “to sculpt a very\r\nspecific voter profile and target down to few hundred readers in a given geo location”\r\n(Ellwanger, 2016).\r\n\r\nONLINE VIDEO ADVERTISING\r\n\r\nDigital video, via mobile and other devices, is perceived as a highly effective way of delivering\r\nemotional content on behalf of brands and marketing campaigns (IAB, n.d.-a). There are a\r\nvariety of online video ad formats that provide both short- and long-form content, and that work\r\nwell for political and other marketing efforts. Progressive political campaign company\r\nRevolution Messaging, which worked for the Sanders campaign, developed what it calls “smart\r\ncookies” that it says take video and other ad placement “to the next level, delivering precision\r\nand accuracy” (Revolution Messaging, n.d.). Google’s YouTube has become a key platform for\r\npolitical ads, with the company claiming that today, voters make their political decisions not in\r\n“living rooms” in front of a television but in what it calls “micromoments” as people watch\r\nmobile video (Doubleclick, n.d.). According to the company’s political ad services research,\r\nmobile devices were used in nearly 60 percent of election-related searches during 2016. Content\r\nproducers (which it calls “Creators”) on YouTube were able to seize on these election micro-\r\nmoments to influence the political opinions of potential voters 18-49 (“Letter from the Guest\r\nEditors,” 2016).\r\n\r\nTARGETED TV ADVERTISING\r\n\r\nTelevision advertising, which remains a linchpin of political campaign strategy, is undergoing a\r\nmajor transformation, as digital technologies and “addressable” set-top boxes have changed\r\ncable and broadcast TV into powerful micro-targeting machines capable of delivering the same\r\nkinds of granular, personalised advertising messages to individual voters that have become the\r\nhallmark of online marketing. Political campaigns are in the forefront of using set-top box\r\n“second-to-second viewing data”, amplified with other data sources, such as “demographic and\r\ncross-platform data from a multitude of sources” via information brokers, to deliver more\r\nprecise ads (Fourthwall Media, n.d.; Leahey, 2016; NCC Media, n.d.). NCC Media, the US cable\r\nTV ad platform owned by Comcast, Cox, and Spectrum, provided campaigns the ability to target\r\npotential voters via the integration of its set-top box viewing information with voter and other\r\ndata from Experian and others (Miller, 2017). Deals between TV data viewing companies and\r\norganisations representing both Republican- and Democratic-leaning groups brought the\r\n“targeting capabilities of online advertising to TV ad buys...bringing what was once accessible\r\nonly to large state-wide or national campaigns to smaller, down-ballot candidates”, explained\r\nAdvertising Age (Delgado, 2016).\r\n\r\nPSYCHOGRAPHIC, NEUROMARKETING, AND EMOTION-BASED TARGETING\r\n\r\nPsychographics, mood measurement, and emotional testing have been used by advertisers for\r\nmany decades, and have also been a core strategy in political campaign advertising (Key, 1974;\r\n\r\nInternet Policy Review | http://policyreview.info\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nDecember 2017 | Volume 6 | Issue 4\r\n\r\nThe role of digital marketing in political campaigns\r\n\r\nPackard, 2007; Schiller, 1975). The digital advertising industry has developed these tools even\r\nfurther, taking advantage of advances in neuroscience, cognitive computing, data analytics,\r\nbehavioural tracking, and other recent developments (Crupi, 2015). Granular-based messages\r\nthat trigger a range of emotional and subconscious responses, to better “engage” with\r\nindividuals and deepen relationships with commercial brands, have become part of the DNA of\r\ndigital advertising (McEleny, 2016). Facebook (2015), Nielsen, and most leading brands use\r\n“neuromarketing” services worldwide, which utilise neuroscience tools to determine the\r\nemotional impact of advertising messages. There is a growing field, recently promoted by\r\nGoogle, of “Emotion Analytics” that takes advantage of “new types of data and new tracking\r\nmethods” to help advertisers “understand the impact of campaigns—and their individual\r\nassets—on an emotional level...” (Kelshaw, 2017). Scholars have identified that the use of\r\n“psychological targeting” in advertising enables the influencing of large groups of people by\r\n“tailoring persuasive appeals to the psychological needs” of the specific audiences (Matz, et al,\r\n2017). Data company Experian Marketing Services for political campaigns offered data that\r\nweaved together “demographic, psychographic and attitudinal attributes” to target voters\r\ndigitally. Experian claims its data enables campaigns to examine a target’s “heart and mind” via\r\nattributes related to their “political persona” as well as “attitudes, expectations, behaviours,\r\nlifestyles, purchase habits and media preferences (Experian, 2011, 2015). One of the most well\r\npublicised and controversial players in the 2016 election was Cambridge Analytica (CA), a\r\nprominent data analytics and behavioural communications firm that claimed to be a key\r\ncomponent in Donald Trump’s victorious campaign. The company used a “five-factor\r\npersonality model” aimed at determining “the personality of every single adult in the United\r\nStates of America” (Albright, 2016; Kranish, 2016).Known as OCEAN, the model rated\r\nindividuals based on five key traits: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness,\r\nand neuroticism. Drawing from digital data, voter history, and marketing resources supplied by\r\nleading companies, including Acxiom, Experian, Nielsen, GOP firm Data Trust, Aristotle, L2,\r\nInfogroup, and Facebook, CA was able to develop an “internal database with thousands of data\r\npoints per person”. Its research also identified key segments that were considered\r\n“persuadable”, and shaped the advertising content placed “across multiple digital channels (with\r\nthe most effective ads also appearing on television) (Advertising Research Foundation, 2017;\r\nNix, 2016). The strategy was based on developing messages that were tailored to the\r\nvulnerabilities of individual voters (Nix, 2016; Schwartz, 2017). CA has become the subject of\r\nmuch scrutiny and debate, and itself has made conflicting claims, with critics raising concerns\r\nover its techniques and expressing scepticism about the extent of its impact (Confessore &\r\nHakim, 2017; Karpf, 2017). However, the company’s work was sufficiently convincing to the\r\nleading advertising industry research organisation, the Advertising Research Foundation (2017,\r\nMarch), that it honoured the firm with a “Gold” award in 2017 under its “Big Data” category.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe above description provides only a brief overview of the data-driven marketing system that is\r\nalready widely in use by candidate and issue campaigns in the United States. The increasingly\r\ncentral role of commercial digital marketing in contemporary political campaigns is reshaping\r\nmodern-day politics in fundamental ways, altering relationships among candidates, parties,\r\nvoters, and the media. We acknowledge that digital technologies have made important positive\r\ncontributions to the vibrancy of the political sphere, including greatly expanding sources of news\r\nand information, significantly increasing opportunities for citizen participation, and\r\nempowering people from diverse backgrounds to form coalitions and influence policy. The same\r\n\r\nInternet Policy Review | http://policyreview.info\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nDecember 2017 | Volume 6 | Issue 4\r\n\r\nThe role of digital marketing in political campaigns\r\n\r\ntools developed for digital marketing have also helped political campaigns substantially improve\r\nvoter engagement, enhance their capacities for “small-donor” fundraising, and more efficiently\r\ngenerate turnout (Moonshadow Mobile, n.d.; Owen, 2017). However, many of the techniques we\r\naddress in this paper raise serious concerns—over privacy, discrimination, manipulation, and\r\nlack of transparency.\r\n\r\nSeveral recent controversies over the 2016 election have triggered greater public scrutiny over\r\nsome of the practices that have become standard operating procedure in the digital media and\r\nmarketing ecosystem. For example, “fake news” has a direct relationship to programmatic\r\nadvertising, the automated system of “intelligent” buying and selling of individuals and groups\r\n(Weissbrot, 2016). These impersonal algorithmic machines are focused primarily on finding and\r\ntargeting individual consumers wherever they are, often with little regard for the content where\r\nthe ads may appear (Maheshwari & Isaac, 2016). As a consequence, in the middle of the 2016\r\nelection, many companies found themselves with ads placed on “sites featuring pornography,\r\npirated content, fake news, videos supporting terrorists, or outlets whose traffic is artificially\r\ngenerated by computer programs”, noted the Wall Street Journal (Nicas, 2016; Vranica, 2017).\r\nAs a major US publisher explained in the trade publication Advertising Age,\r\n\r\nProgrammatic’s golden promise was allowing advertisers to efficiently buy targeted,\r\nquality, ad placements at the best price, and publishers to sell available space to the\r\nhighest bidders.... What was supposed to be a tech-driven quality guarantee became,\r\nin some instances, a “race to the bottom” to make as much money as possible across a\r\ncomplex daisy chain of partners. With billions of impressions bought and sold every\r\nmonth, it is impossible to keep track of where ads appear, so “fake news” sites\r\nproliferated. Shady publishers can put up new sites every day, so even if an exchange\r\nor bidding platform identifies one site as suspect, another can spring up (Clark,\r\n2017).\r\n\r\nCriticism from news organisations and civil society groups, along with a major backlash by\r\nleading global advertisers, led to several initiatives to place safeguards on these practices\r\n(McDermott, 2017; Minsker, 2017). For example, in an effort to ensure “brand safety”, leading\r\nglobal advertisers and trade associations demanded changes in how Google, Facebook and\r\nothers conduct their data and advertising technology operations. As a consequence, new\r\nmeasures have been introduced to enable companies to more closely monitor and control where\r\ntheir ads are placed (Association of National Advertisers, 2017; Benes, 2017; IPA, 2017;\r\nJohnson, 2017; Liyakasa, 2017; Marshall, 2017; Timmers, 2015).\r\n\r\nThe Trump campaign relied heavily on Facebook’s digital marketing system to identify specific\r\nvoters who were not supporters of Trump in the first place, and to target them with\r\npsychographic messaging designed to discourage them from voting (Green & Issenberg, 2016).\r\nCampaign operatives openly referred to such efforts as “voter suppression” aimed at three\r\ntargeted groups: “idealistic white liberals, young women and African Americans”. The\r\noperations used standard Facebook advertising tools, including “custom audiences” and so-\r\ncalled “dark posts”—“nonpublic paid posts shown only to the Facebook users that Trump chose”\r\nwith personalised negative messages (Green & Issenberg, 2016). Such tactics also took\r\nadvantage of commonplace digital practices that target individual consumers based on factors\r\nsuch as race, ethnicity, and socio-economic status (Google, 2017; Martinez, 2016; Nielsen,\r\n2016). Civil rights groups have had some success in getting companies to change their practices.\r\nHowever, for the most part, the digital marketing industry has not been held sufficiently\r\n\r\nInternet Policy Review | http://policyreview.info\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nDecember 2017 | Volume 6 | Issue 4\r\n\r\nThe role of digital marketing in political campaigns\r\n\r\naccountable for its use of race and ethnicity in data-marketing products, and there is a need for\r\nmuch broader, industry-wide policies.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nContemporary digital marketing practices have raised serious issues about consumer privacy\r\nover the years (Schwartz & Solove, 2011; Solove & Hartzog, 2014). When applied to the political\r\narena, where political information about individuals is only one of thousands of highly sensitive\r\ndata points collected and analysed by the modern machinery of data analytics and targeting, the\r\nrisks are even greater. Yet, in the United States, very little has been done in terms of public\r\npolicy to provide any significant protections. In contrast to the European Union, where privacy\r\nis encoded in law as a fundamental right, privacy regulation in the US is much weaker (Bennett,\r\n1997; Solove & Hartzog, 2014; U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and\r\nTransportation, 2013). The US is one of the only developed countries without a general privacy\r\nlaw. As a consequence, except in specific areas, such as children’s privacy, consumers in the US\r\nenjoy no significant data protection in the commercial marketplace. In the political arena, there\r\nis even less protection for US citizens. As legal scholar Ira S. Rubinstein (2014) explains, “the\r\ncollection, use and transfer of voter data face almost no regulation”. The First Amendment plays\r\na crucial role in this regard, allowing the use of political data as a protected form of speech\r\n(Persily, 2016).\r\n\r\nThe political fallout over the how Russian operatives used Facebook, Twitter, and other sites in\r\nthe 2016 presidential campaign has triggered unprecedented focus on the data and marketing\r\noperations of these and other powerful digital media companies. Lawmakers, civil society, and\r\nmany in the press are calling for new laws and regulations to ensure transparency and\r\naccountability for online political ads (“McCain, Klobuchar & Warner Introduce Legislation”,\r\n2017). The U.S. Federal Election Commission, which regulates political advertising, has asked\r\nfor public comments on whether it should develop new disclosure rules for online ads (Glaser,\r\n2017). In an effort to head-off regulation, both Facebook and Twitter have announced their own\r\ninternal policy initiatives designed to provide the public with more information, including what\r\norganisations or individuals paid for political ads and who the intended targets were. These\r\ncompanies have also promised to establish archives for political advertising, which would be\r\naccessible to the public (Falck, 2017; Goldman, 2017; Koltun, 2017). The US online advertising\r\nindustry trade association is urging Congress not to legislate in this area, but to allow the\r\nindustry to develop new self-regulatory regimes in order to police itself (IAB, 2017). However,\r\nrelying on self-regulation is not likely to address the problems raised by these practices and\r\nmay, in fact, compound them. Industry self-regulatory guidelines are typically written in ways\r\nthat do not challenge many of the prevailing (and problematic) business practices employed by\r\ntheir own members. Nor do they provide meaningful or effective accountability mechanisms\r\n(Center for Digital Democracy, 2013; Gellman & Dixon, 2011; Hoofnagle, 2005). It remains to be\r\nseen what the outcome of the current policy debate over digital politics will be, and whether any\r\nmeaningful safeguards emerge from it.\r\n\r\nWhile any regulation of political speech must meet the legal challenges posed by the First\r\nAmendment, limiting how the mining of commercial data can be used in the first place can serve\r\nas a critically important new electoral safeguard. Advocacy groups should call for consumer\r\nprivacy legislation in the US that would place limits on what data can be gathered by the\r\ncommercial online advertising industry, and how that information can be used.

Certain online advertising practices, such as the use of psychographics and lookalike\r\nmodelling, also call for rules to ensure they are used fairly.\r\n\r\nWithout effective interventions, the campaign strategies and practices we have documented in\r\nthis paper will become increasingly sophisticated in coming elections, most likely with little\r\noversight, transparency, or public accountability. The digital media and marketing industry will\r\ncontinue its research and development efforts, with an intense focus on harnessing the\r\ncapabilities of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and cognitive\r\ncomputing, for advertising purposes. Advertising agencies are already applying some of these\r\nadvances to the political field (Facebook, 2016; Google, n.d.-a; Havas Cognitive, n.d.). Academic\r\nscholars and civil society organisations will need to keep a close watch on all these\r\ndevelopments, in order to understand fully how these digital practices operate as a system, and\r\nhow they are influencing the political process. Only through effective public policies and\r\nenforceable best practices can we ensure that digital technology enhances democratic\r\ninstitutions, without undermining their fundamental goals.\r\n\r\nInternet Policy Review | http://policyreview.info\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nDecember 2017 | Volume 6 | Issue 4\r\n\r\nThe role of digital marketing in political campaigns\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\nAdvertising Research Foundation.

    "brochure_text": "E\r\n\r\nS\r\n\r\nEVOLVING\r\nSTRATEGI ES\r\n\r\nA fool, Mr. Edgeworth, is one who has never made an experiment.\r\n\r\n— Erasmus Darwin\r\n\r\nWho’s Winning the Presidential Ad War?\r\n\r\nThe impact of Romney and Obama campaign ads on weak partisan & pure independent voters.\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n\r\nAd spending this election year is pushing toward the $1 Billion mark,\r\nand there’s no sign of slowing. So who is winning the Presidential ad\r\nwar? To discover whether Obama’s or Romney’s ads are more effective\r\nin shifting the vote, we partnered with Qualtrics and executed a\r\nPocketTrial™ testing the individual and combined impacts of seven\r\nRomney and Obama campaign ads.\r\n\r\nOur PocketTrial™ quantifies the true impact of a message using a\r\ncustomized, double-blind, and fully controlled experimental design. It’s\r\nlike a small-scale clinical drug trial, but it’s a message we’re testing.\r\n\r\nWe exposed more than 2,300 registered, pure independents and weak\r\npartisans - no strong Republicans or Democrats - to one or more of\r\nseven political ads from the Obama and Romney camps (the Control\r\ngroup watched no ads). Respondents were randomly assigned to one of\r\n11 conditions in a true experiment - 10 treatment groups and a control.\r\nStatistical analyses were performed to identify significant “treatment”\r\nimpacts.\r\n\r\nWe tested the individual and combined impact of matched Obama\r\nand Romney ads from three “themes,” 1) Medicare ads, 2) Economic\r\nAttack ads, and 3) Comprehensive, economic-focused “Plan” ads. In\r\naddition, we tested 4) the impact of the “Disappointed” ad from\r\nAmericans for Prosperity, which has been highly rated in focus groups\r\nand received heavy air time.\r\n\r\nKey Findings\r\n\r\nSo which side is winning the Presidential Ad War? It depends on how\r\nmuch enthusiasm matters compared to marginal vote shifts this year . . .\r\n\r\nThe Obama ads have a significant impact on vote preference, increasing\r\nObama's vote and decreasing Romney's. The Romney ads aren’t\r\neffective in shifting preferences.\r\n\r\nObama’s ads increase his vote by about 6 points on\r\naverage - a 15% bump in Obama's vote\r\n\r\nThey decrease Romney’s vote by about 8 points - an\r\n18% slide in Romney's vote.\r\n\r\nRound 1 to Obama: Obama ads increase the percentage\r\nof marginal undecided and wavering voters who prefer him.\r\n\r\nThe twist . . . both the Romney and Obama ads are effective at\r\nincreasing enthusiasm among likely Romney voters (McCain voters from\r\n2008). The Obama ads don’t significantly impact the enthusiasm of ’08\r\nObama voters.\r\n\r\nRomney and Obama ads increase the highest level of\r\nvoter enthusiasm of ’08 McCain voters by 13 points - a\r\n42% surge in the number of McCain ’08 voters who are\r\nextremely enthusiastic to vote this year.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm for ’08 Obama voters remains flat.\r\n\r\nRound 2 to Romney: Romney ads impact marginal,\r\ndecided voters, increasing the likelihood that voters who\r\nsay they prefer him will actually turn out to vote.\r\n\r\nEVOLVI NG\r\nSTRATEGIES\r\n\r\nA fool, Mr. Edgeworth, is one who has never made an experiment.\r\n\r\n— Erasmus Darwin\r\n\r\nExperiment, Survey Design & Analysis\r\n\r\nExperiment & Survey Design\r\n\r\nRespondents were randomly assigned (within Party identification blocks) to one of eleven\r\nconditions in a true experiment - ten treatment groups and a control:\r\n\r\n1.\tControl Condition\r\n\r\nRespondents were not exposed to either ad before the policy and election questions\r\nwere answered.\r\n\r\n2.\tMedicare Ad Conditions\r\n\r\nRespondents viewed either a Romney Medicare ad, an Obama Medicare ad, or both.\r\n\r\n3.\tEconomic Attack Ad Conditions\r\n\r\nRespondents viewed either a Romney economic attack ad, an Obama economic attack\r\nad, or both.\r\n\r\n4.\tComprehensive “Plan” Ad Conditions\r\n\r\nRespondents viewed either a Romney ad laying out his plan for the country, an Obama\r\n“plan” ad that also defends his record, or both of these ads as well as Romney’s\r\nEconomic Attack Ad.\r\n\r\n5.\tAFP “Disappointed” Ad Condition\r\n\r\nRespondents viewed an widely-aired ad produced by American for Prosperity, in which\r\nObama voters express their disappointment with the President.\r\n\r\nAll respondents otherwise answered the same survey questions in an identical survey\r\ninstrument. The order in which the ads were presented to respondents in the combined\r\ntreatment conditions was randomized, as were other questions and responses where\r\nappropriate. The sample was drawn from an opt-in panel to approximate the 2008 electorate\r\nin the CCES 2008 validated dataset (non-strong partisans only) on education, age, gender, and\r\nrace. All respondents were screened to be registered, pure independents and weak partisans.\r\nThe survey was conducted from Sept. 28-Oct. 3.\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\n\r\nImpact analysis was conducted using multinomial logistic regression models, which\r\nincluded variables for treatment interactions, treatment/gender or ’08 vote choice interactions\r\nas well as party identification, liberal/conservative self-identification, age group, attention to\r\nthe news, and being “born-again.” Predicted probabilities are adjusted to match the ’08 vote,\r\nby gender, in the CCES 2008 validated dataset. All percentages are predicted probabilities\r\nbased on the marginal impact of each treatment. Significance was determined using a pairwise\r\ncomparison of treatment impact to control for all respondents or by gender and/or ’08 vote.\r\n\r\nThe basic structure of a\r\nPocketTrial™ . . .\r\n\r\n1.\tRespondents enter the PocketTrial . . .\r\n\r\n2.\tRespondents answer screening and\r\ncontrol questions . . .\r\n\r\n3.

It is valuable, but you can’t spend\r\nit on yourself; you can only give it away. Sometimes people give\r\ntheir vote to a candidate because they like and want to help him.\r\nAnd a lot of the time, people give their vote to a candidate\r\nbecause they dislike the other candidate and want to hurt him.\r\n\r\nA vote is a real action, something of value that voters use to\r\nhelp or harm candidates. But asking a respondent who they would\r\nvote for if the election was held today is a very abstract thing . . .\r\nthere is little, if anything, of value attached to their answer.\r\n\r\nSo how can we make an early “vote” real for survey\r\nrespondents? How can we put respondents in a decision\r\nframework where their response will really help or harm one of\r\nthe candidates?\r\n\r\nTaking inspiration from experiments in behavioral economics, we\r\ndeveloped a game that is analogous to a real-life vote decision.\r\n\r\nWe gave each respondent $100 to give to Barrack Obama or\r\nMitt Romney candidate. But that’s not all; they could also choose\r\nto take away $100 from one of the candidates. And if they were\r\nreally uncertain, they could choose to let the money go to the\r\ndefault winner of the survey.\r\n\r\nThis makes an abstract early “vote” concrete by attaching real\r\nvalue to their answer in the survey. It allows us to better capture\r\nwho someone will vote for, or against, and what motivates their\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nEVOLVI NG\r\nSTRATEGIES\r\n\r\nA fool, Mr. Edgeworth, is one who has never made an experiment.\r\n\r\n— Erasmus Darwin\r\n\r\nPresidential Vote - Measured by the MoneyVote (\r\n\r\nImpact on the MoneyVote ® - All Respondents\r\n\r\nThe Obama ads have a significant impact on vote preference,\r\nincreasing Obama's vote and decreasing Romney's.

For\r\ninstance, if people who prefer Romney are much more enthusiastic\r\nabout voting and people people who prefer Obama are less enthusiastic,\r\nthat means more Romney \"voters\" will get counted because they are\r\nnow \"likely voters\" and fewer Obama \"voters\" will be counted.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you can have a significant shift in the polls with very\r\nlittle shift in underlying voter preference for the candidates.

    "brochure_text": "Written evidence submitted by Aleksandr Kogan\r\n\r\nOver the past several months, your committee and the general public have seen a number of allegations\r\nand claims about myself, Cambridge Analytica, and Facebook—some of these claims have been true,\r\nwhile many others have been speculation, exaggeration, or misinformation. I am very much looking\r\nforward to the opportunity to help set the record straight. With that goal, I write to you today to provide\r\nan honest account of events to the best of my understanding, knowledge, and memory in preparation\r\nfor my testimony on April 24th, 2018.\r\n\r\nMy Background\r\n\r\nI am a social psychologist whose academic work focuses on well-being, kindness, and compassion. To\r\nstudy these topics, my lab and I use a variety of methods, including surveys, behavioral studies, and\r\nsocial media. I received my B.A. degree in Psychology from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2008\r\nand a Ph.D. in Psychology from the University of Hong Kong in 2011. Since 2012, I have been a Research\r\nAssociate and University Lecturer at the University of Cambridge in the Department of Psychology. At\r\nthe University, I have conducted research, taught classes, and supervised graduate and undergraduate\r\nresearch work through the Cambridge Prosociality and Well-being Laboratory (the \"CPW Lab\")—which I\r\nfounded and direct.\r\n\r\nWith relevance to social media, the CPW Lab's research used information gathered from individuals\r\nthrough multi-question online surveys. The participants in these studies were recruited through third-\r\nparty online survey vendors, such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics, and are individuals who\r\nhave agreed through those vendors to take online surveys for money. Participants are paid a small sum\r\n(usually a few dollars) in exchange for completing each survey. All of my academic work was reviewed\r\nand approved by the University's ethics committees.\r\n\r\nThe Facebook App and My Collaboration with Facebook\r\n\r\nIn early 2013, I began collaborating directly with Facebook on studies aiming to understand how people\r\nconnect and express emotions around the world. Throughout 2013, Facebook provided me with several\r\nmacro-level datasets on friendship connections and emoticon usage. These datasets were aggregated,\r\ntypically at the country level (e.g., number of friendship connections between USA and UK).\r\n\r\nAs my lab began writing papers with Facebook using this data, I created a Facebook app, which I called\r\nthe CPW Lab app (after the name of my lab) in order for us to collect individual level data to pair with\r\nthe data Facebook had provided directly. In studies where we used the app, we would ask participants\r\nto complete a survey and to provide us with information from their Facebook accounts by logging in\r\nthrough the Facebook application portal. The terms and conditions of the CPW Lab App were contained\r\nin a link on the Facebook application portal's login page. The terms and conditions indicated that the\r\ndata would be used for academic purposes.\r\n\r\nApproximately 5,000 to 15,000 survey participants logged into Facebook through the CPW Lab App, and\r\ntheir data was collected in an anonymized manner. The CPW Lab App also collected information that\r\nmembers of the participants' Facebook friend networks (\"friends\") had shared with the participants,\r\nincluding demographic information and the Facebook \"pages\" that the friends had publicly \"liked.\"\r\n\r\nFriend information was collected for individuals whose Facebook privacy settings gave the survey\r\nparticipants access to the friends' \"likes\" and demographic information. For a few studies, we also\r\ncollected private message data (I estimate approximately 1000-2000 users participated in these studies).\r\nPrivate message data was collected only from participants—not friends—and we made it explicitly clear\r\nin the consent form at the beginning of the study we would be collecting this information. The private\r\nmessages were of interest in our studies of how people expressed emotions online. Data collected\r\nthrough the CPW Lab App was housed at the University of Cambridge and used for academic purposes;\r\nit was not provided to SCL Group. As with all of my research, the research that used the app was first\r\nethics approved by the University.\r\n\r\nSCL Relationship\r\n\r\nI was first introduced to SCL through a PhD student at U of Cambridge in February 2014. He introduced\r\nme to Chris Wylie, who represented SCL at the time. Our conversations began with Mr Wylie detailing\r\nhis experiences working for the Obama campaign, and the desire to share commercial datasets with\r\nacademics. He asked me to potentially provide survey-consulting services to SCL.\r\n\r\nEventually the conversation turned towards personality and Facebook, and at that point I introduced Mr\r\nWylie to David Stillwell, who had collected a large Facebook personality dataset called myPersonality.\r\n\r\nMr Wylie was interested in acquiring the myPersonality dataset from Dr Stillwell, but after considering\r\nthe proposition for a few months, Dr Stillwell decided against it on the grounds that he had collected the\r\ndata for academic purposes—and that is what he warranted to his users. At this time, Dr Stillwell, Dr\r\nMichal Kosinski (a close collaborator of Dr Stillwell's), and I proposed making personality predictions for\r\nSCL. Dr Stillwell and Kosinski had already developed a model to make predictions from likes, and I had\r\nexperience using the Facebook login app from my previous. This idea of predicting personality from\r\npage likes became the foundation of the project that I did with SCL. Eventually, Dr. Stillwell and Kosinski\r\nwere removed from the project because they requested $500,000 to work on the models—a request\r\nSCL ultimately felt was unreasonable given the unproven commercial nature of the models. And so I was\r\nasked to handle both the data collection and modeling.\r\n\r\nTo do the project, a fellow University of Cambridge research psychologist and I registered a company,\r\nGlobal Science Research (\"GSR\"). In June 2014, GSR entered into a data and technology subscription\r\nagreement with SCL Elections Limited (\"SCL\") (the \"Agreement\"). GSR agreed to provide SCL with\r\nspecified demographic and personality data for individuals in 11 US states. In return, SCL agreed to pay\r\nthe cost of collecting the data, which consisted chiefly of fees paid to survey participants (about three to\r\nfour dollars per participant). SCL's payments under the Agreement, made directly to the Qualtrics,\r\namounted to about $800,000. During the Summer of 2014, Qualtrics recruited between 200,000 and\r\n300,000 participants to take a survey developed for the purpose of collecting particular data.\r\n\r\nThroughout the project, Mr Wylie worked as our guide on how to be compliant with all legal frameworks\r\nand requirements. Given that we were academics with little money, were not going to be getting paid\r\nfrom the Agreement, and were assured that Mr Wylie was a data law expert given his previous\r\nexperience, we relied on Mr Wylie exclusively for guidance on compliance.\r\n\r\nBefore we started collecting data from survey participants, GSR changed the name and terms and\r\nconditions of the application. The terms of service were provided to us via email in early June by Mr.\r\nWylie. References to academic use and the University of Cambridge were deleted from the terms and\r\nconditions, and the name of the application was changed from \"CPW Lab App\" to \"GSR App.\" GSR also\r\n\r\nchanged the terms and conditions of the application to reflect the expected use of the data. When\r\nindividuals who participated in the survey logged into Facebook through the GSR App portal, Facebook\r\npresented a link to the GSR App's terms and conditions, which informed each participant as follows:\r\n\r\n[i]f you click \"OKAY\" or otherwise use the Application or accept payment, you permit GSR to\r\nedit, copy, disseminate, publish, transfer, append or merge with other databases, sell, licence\r\n(by whatever means and on whatever terms) and archive your contribution and data . . . and\r\ngrant GSR an irrevocable, sublicenceable, assignable, non- exclusive, transferrable and\r\nworldwide license to use your data and contribution for any purpose.\r\n\r\nThe terms of service also informed each survey participant that GSR would collect \"any information that\r\n[the participant] choose[s] to share with us by using the Application. This may include, inter alia, the\r\nname, demographics, status updates and Facebook likes of your profile and of your network.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the participants entered their Facebook credentials into the GSR App Facebook login portal, they\r\nwere automatically taken back to the third-party survey vendor's website to complete the survey. GSR\r\ncollected data from the survey participants and their friends whose Facebook privacy settings were set\r\nto allow the participants access to their information. The data collected from participants and friends\r\nincluded, if available, an individual's name, birth date, location (city and state), gender and the Facebook\r\npages each user had \"liked.\" As with the CPW Lab iteration of the application, information was collected\r\nfrom friends whose Facebook privacy settings were set to provide the survey participants access to the\r\nfriends' \"likes\" and demographic information.\r\n\r\nIn late 2014, GSR provided SCL with the data and analyses called for by the Agreement. This consisted of\r\n(i) demographic information for survey participants and their friends in the 11 specified states; and (ii)\r\npersonality scores and a limited number of predictions for survey participants and friends based on the\r\ncollected data.\r\n\r\nSCL later requested that we provide data and analysis for survey participants and their friends for all 50\r\nstates. In early 2015, we provided the additional data requested by SCL. This second set of data\r\ncontained the same types of demographic information, survey responses, but fewer personality analyses\r\nthan those that had been provided for the original 11 states that had been turned over pursuant to the\r\nAgreement. In addition, for the second set of data, SCL requested information on whether the friends\r\nand survey participants had \"likes\" for about 500 pages specified by SCL, which included some political\r\nfigures and celebrities. GSR provided this additional \"like\" data, which amounted to about four percent\r\nof each friend's \"likes.\" SCL also requested and received information on who people were friends with\r\n(social network connections). In return for the second set of data, SCL paid GSR £230,000. These funds\r\nwere used by GSR for research, development, administrative costs, and professional services. I did not\r\nreceive any salary from GSR at any point during its operation.\r\n\r\nOther entities we shared data with\r\n\r\nGSR also transferred an anonymized copy of the GSR App data to the CPW Lab (for research purposes),\r\nand some derivative information (for example, psychological trait predictions) from some of the GSR\r\nApp data to academic research colleagues at University of Toronto.\r\n\r\nLastly, GSR entered into an agreement with Eunoia (Chris Wylie's company) in the summer of 2014 to\r\nprovide GSR App data to Eunoia in return for getting other commercial datasets from Eunoia. Under this\r\n\r\nagreement, GSR provided Eunoia with a copy of all of the GSR App data for people who reported their\r\nlocation in the United States along with GSR personality analyses on some of the data. After Eunoia\r\nfailed to provide the promised data to GSR, GSR instructed Eunoia to destroy the GSR App data that had\r\nbeen transferred.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, there is a substantial difference between the data SCL and Mr Wylie's company were\r\nprovided. SCL was never given, at least by GSR, access to the raw Facebook data containing all of the\r\nLikes. SCL received only demographic information (if available, name, birth date, location (city and\r\nstate), gender) and personality predictions and, later in 2015, the limited set of 500 page likes specified\r\nin 2015, representing 4% of the overall Likes. This is in contrast with the contract with Mr. Wylie's entity\r\nEunoia, where Eunoia received all of the page like data as well as dyads.\r\n\r\nThisisyourdigitallife\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 2014, after the GSR App data collection was complete, we at GSR revised the\r\napplication to become an interactive personality \"quiz.\" For this purpose, the app was renamed\r\n\"thisisyourdigitallife.\" The commercial portions of the terms and conditions quoted above were not\r\nchanged. Participants could authorize the application to view their profiles, and the application would\r\nanalyze the participants' \"likes\" and provide the participants with insights regarding their personalities.\r\nParticipants were not paid to use this iteration of the application.\r\n\r\nThe thisisyourdigitallife App was used by only a few hundred individuals and, like the two prior iterations\r\nof the application, collected demographic information and data about \"likes\" for survey participants and\r\ntheir friends whose Facebook privacy settings gave participants access to \"likes\" and demographic\r\ninformation. Data collected by the thisisyourdigitallife App was not provided to SCL.\r\n\r\nAccuracy of personality scores\r\n\r\nOne of the biggest points of confusion has been how accurate the personality scores we provided to SCL\r\nwere. The truth is that the scores were highly inaccurate. We estimate that we were right about all five\r\ntraits for about 1% of the people—in contrast, we were wrong about all 5 traits for about 6% of the\r\npeople. Looking at accuracy another way, we found that the scores were more accurate than a random\r\nguess, but less accurate than assuming everyone is average on every trait. I'd be delighted to discuss this\r\nin more depth when I testify with a slide deck to illustrate this point.\r\n\r\nNeed for the dataset for micro-targeting on Facebook\r\n\r\nA second point of confusion is whether the data we collected would be useful for micro-targeting ads on\r\nFacebook. I believe the project we did makes little to no sense if the goal is to run targeted ads on\r\nFacebook. The Facebook ads platform provides tools and capability to run targeted ads with little need\r\n\r\nfor our work—in fact, the platform's tools provide companies a far more effective pathway to target\r\npeople based on their personalities than using scores from users from our work. I again look forward to\r\ndiscussing this in greater detail in front of the committee.\r\n\r\nAleksandr Kogan\r\nApril 16, 2018",

Third, PO. Box 8190, Little Rock, AR 72203-8190 | www.acxiom.com\r\n\r\n© 2015 Acxiom Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nIN\r\n\r\nthis, the second of our MoneyAds™ Mentor Series, we look at how modern\r\nadvertisers strive to create connected experiences for consumers and\r\nfoster trust, all in (near) real time. Recognition — recognizing consumers\r\nacross channels, offline or online — is the foundation for this, and it all begins with\r\nconnected data to drive connected experiences when and where your audience is\r\nmost receptive. While recognition may seem easy to achieve, the ability to do this\r\nacross channels, devices and media is highly complex. The good news is, with more\r\nplaces to reach consumers, brands have the opportunity to drive expanded reach\r\nand greater relevance with ad technology partners.\r\n\r\nAs consumers, we live multi-channel lives and often interact with our favorite brands through a myriad of\r\nchannels, and nowhere more so these days than on websites, on our mobile phones, or wherever we go\r\nto watch TV or videos. Our shift in behavior has impacted marketing so much that when recently asked,\r\n28 percent of marketing leaders said they plan to reallocate resources to prioritize an omni-channel\r\nengagement strategy.1\r\n\r\nHow can advertisers begin to execute such a strategy? A brand’s journey must start with its own invaluable\r\ncustomer data to recognize consumers consistently across channels, while respecting their need for\r\nprivacy and discretion. While this concept has been table stakes in the offline world, the digital world has\r\npresented a slew of hurdles, such as rapidly evolving technology and platforms and the format of the data\r\nitself. The challenge then lies in the consistent application of consumer data across channels.\r\n\r\nAfter all, if recognition drives connected experiences, then\r\nconsumer data matching drives the connection of data.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways:\r\n\r\n1.\tA cross-channel view of the consumer is the foundation for true multi-channel advertising. After all,\r\nyou can’t target who you don’t recognize.\r\n\r\n2.\tCarefully craft the mix of digital channels to create connected experiences for your intended audience.\r\n\r\n3.\tAdopt recognition and matching best practices that deliver the highest degree of accuracy and reach.\r\nExpertise in recognition across time and channels is essential.\r\n\r\n4.\tSelect an ad tech partner that is integrated with a large network of partners and publishers, especially\r\nthose most important to your brand, to allow you to effectively leverage your customer data and boost\r\nyour ability to reach consumers through their channel(s) of choice.\r\n\r\n5.\tRecognition across channels does not mean annoying people across channels. Ensure you and your\r\nad tech partners always use data ethically to protect consumer privacy.\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nI'm supposed to work with who?\r\n\r\nStudy after study shows the value of multichannel marketing and how consumers who engage with\r\na brand through multiple channels spend much more than single-channel consumers, with some\r\nestimating a 4X difference between the two groups,2 with others finding an average of $9 in\r\nincremental sales for every $1 of online advertising.3\r\n\r\nAs enticing as that value proposition is, for marketers tasked with creating the connected experiences\r\nneeded to reap these benefits, they must make sense of an ecosystem that looks like this:\r\n\r\nWhere should they even start? And how many consumers can they identify with a high degree of\r\naccuracy to deliver a relevant digital offer in an individual campaign? Marketers want to know how often\r\nthey will recognize a consumer across channels. And what is the best mix of channels to reach their\r\ntarget audience and uncover new prospects?\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe tremendous proliferation of channels and devices has occurred primarily in the digital realm. When\r\nbrands start drafting a digital advertising strategy, often they will need to use a mix of channels to\r\nsolve for accuracy, reach, scale and personalization. In this paper we will explore six key channels or\r\napproaches, primarily digital, to consider:\r\n\r\n1.\tPremium Publishers - These are websites with huge numbers of visitors who spend long periods of\r\ntime on the sites. Typically, these sites require registration, providing the publishers with volunteered\r\ninformation about their visitors, which delivers a wealth of personally identifiable information (PII).\r\nExamples include Facebook, Amazon, eBay, Yahoo and Twitter.\r\n\r\n2.\tProgrammatic Media - AdExchanger defines this as “the automation of media buying and selling\r\nprocesses and decisions, enhanced through data,” and continues, “Once perceived simply as\r\nthe domain of low-quality inventory and belly fat busting ads, programmatic is becoming the new\r\nnormal for the largest brands in the world.”4 Some even estimate that by 2017, programmatic will\r\nrepresent 87 percent of display advertising spend.5 Whereas with premium publishers brands are\r\nusually targeting consumers, with programmatic advertisers are typically targeting audiences. Unlike\r\npremium publishers, where targeting is often based on PII, programmatic is usually not attributable to\r\na given consumer.\r\n\r\n3.\tMobile Networks - Perhaps the most personal of channels, mobile has the opportunity to be king in\r\nproviding everything necessary for contextual marketing.\r\n\r\nStudies show that \"half of U.S. online adults own at least\r\nthree Internet-connected devices and go online from\r\nthem multiple times a day from multiple locations.\"6\r\n\r\nFor this reason, mobile has also become the linchpin for media consumption, offering consumers\r\nthe ability to read/watch/order/research any product or service — anytime, anywhere. It cannot be\r\nignored when crafting a multichannel marketing strategy.\r\n\r\n4.\tCall Centers - One of the best avenues to enhance customer experience, call centers are still a\r\ncritical channel for marketers in several industries, such as high-end retail, insurance and financial\r\nservices. Because this is also one of the most expensive channels (the longer the phone call with\r\na customer, the lower the profitability), real-time data integration and recognition is paramount for\r\noperators to solve someone’s problem on the first call.\r\n\r\n5.\tAddressable Television/Video on Demand - These providers are usually subscription-based\r\ndigital entertainment services with set-top boxes that offer the ability to send a specific TV\r\ncommercial to a ZIP Code or household. Examples include: Cablevision, DirectTV, Dish Network,\r\nTime Warner and Comcast.\r\n\r\n6.\tOnline Video - While this approach is akin to addressable TV in some cases, there are actually\r\nseveral business models for online video providers, and the advertising opportunities vary accordingly.\r\nOnline video is quickly becoming the intersection of video/television and mobile, with consumers\r\nchoosing not only when to consume certain content but also on which device, which often is a\r\nsmartphone or tablet. Marketers need to consider their ability to deliver through this emerging channel.\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of connected experiences, and knowing that most brands will use a mix of channels in their\r\nadvertising, how can marketers effectively recognize consumers across channels and devices? What\r\nare the best practices for recognizing a consumer and matching disparate data sets about them to\r\ndeliver the most relevant and meaningful offers to create connected experiences, build brand affinity\r\nand earn customers for life?\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nOn your mark, get set, go!\r\n\r\nHow do you pick the optimal mix of marketing channels? There are few hard and fast rules. The bottom\r\nline is that you want to reach consumers where they are. Don’t know how to do that? You can learn\r\nhow, step by step, in the Comprehensive Guide to New Leads and Better Customers.\r\n\r\nBut let’s move beyond the who and address the how. Because you know your audience, you know how\r\nto pick the right channel(s) for your campaigns. What are the best practices for recognizing consumers\r\nacross channels, matching disparate data sets into a single view to deliver timely, relevant messages\r\nwithin those channels?\r\n\r\n•\tPremium Publishers - For the highest level of accuracy, relevance and privacy, you want to match\r\nvisitor information in a neutral safe-haven sitting between your CRM data and the publisher’s data.\r\nThis requires a partnership on the front end between the publisher and your recognition partner so\r\nthey can utilize your partner’s safe haven and work together to safeguard consumer privacy.\r\n\r\n•\tProgrammatic - This often leverages cookie matching, ideally through a partner with the largest\r\ncookie pool possible that can handle large volumes of information with streamlined data onboarding.\r\nSolid integrations with DMPs and other execution tools will also improve your rates of success and\r\nthe timeliness of your offers.\r\n\r\n•\tMobile Networks - While marketers won’t argue the importance of mobile to cross-channel advertising,\r\n\r\nin a recent study 42 percent cited the inability to accurately\r\ntarget the same user across channels as a major challenge\r\nwhen running cross-channel campaigns.7\r\n\r\nWhy does mobile present such difficulties for recognition? With cookies working in some online\r\nbrowsers but not in apps, one of the most common tools used to identify consumers is hindered\r\nin achieving real scale. However, it is possible to achieve optimized targeting by “going beyond\r\ndemographics to identify specific individuals based on their authenticated log-in, device identification, or\r\ngiven PII, and then layering in their past behaviors, affinities, and relationship with your brand. Relying\r\non third-party or publisher data won’t suffice here, and it is imperative for marketers to now integrate\r\ntheir own first-party and CRM data to target with this level of granularity and personalization.”8\r\n\r\n•\tCall Centers - The key to recognition here is ensuring that phone numbers are included in each\r\ncustomer record, whether from a brand’s own CRM data or appended from third-party data. This data\r\ncan be used in real-time not only for recognition but also to make all the data a company has about\r\n\r\na consumer available to a call center associate. For example, seeing order history or knowing if the\r\nconsumer has been having difficulties on the website, may be the key to resolving an issue quickly\r\nand successfully.\r\n\r\n•\tAddressable Television/Video on Demand - Addressable ads are currently available in nearly\r\n50 million households, and the number is climbing. But, because the ads target a household, you\r\nwill pay a premium for this level of optimization. The more specific and affluent the target — for\r\nexample, households in a higher income bracket — the higher the cost. For that reason, you should\r\nuse a process similar to what you use for working with premium publishers but with a more surgical\r\nattention to relevance.\r\n\r\nNote, because of differences in technologies and data sets across addressable television providers,\r\nbe sure your recognition partner is equipped to integrate disparate technologies to market effectively\r\nto your intended audience.\r\n\r\nOnline Video - Best practices for recognition here will depend on your platform of choice. For\r\nmarketers, devices that stream directly from the internet, like Roku or Apple TV, are similar to\r\nset-top boxes that enable addressable TV. Others that are ad-supported, like Hulu, may be closer to\r\nprogrammatic. And don’t forget the premium publishers that have acquired online video capabilities, like\r\nAOL with Adap.tv or Google with YouTube. Beware a vendor that touts its ability to recognize consumers\r\nacross any online video platform; recognition here needs to be addressed on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\nWhat was your name again?\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that effective cross-channel marketing is a multi-step process requiring a high level\r\nof expertise, computing horsepower, security, the right channel choices and a strong sensitivity to\r\nconsumers’ desire for privacy. But it’s worth the effort.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the channel or channels you choose, there are some fundamentals to consider as you\r\nbuild your recognition capabilities:\r\n\r\nStart with good data - Using data to recognize consumers is a decades-old practice, but today’s\r\ndigital publisher environment comes with modern technology and privacy requirements. Many premium\r\npublishers have established partnerships to allow brands to safely make the most of their own marketing\r\ndatabase’s intelligence, matching it to a publisher’s data within a safe haven, a privacy-compliant\r\nenvironment behind a firewall that protects the information and privacy of those in the database.\r\n\r\nacxi#m\tTo learn more about the Acxiom Safe Haven,\r\n\r\nvisit www.acxiom.com/recognitionsafehaven\r\nSAFE HAVEN\tfor an informative video.\r\n\r\nPREMIUM PUBLISHERS\r\n\r\nCan’t do a direct, data-to-data match? Cookies can help! - Ideally, your recognition partner should\r\nhave a very large pool of cookies set through a myriad of publishers for the greatest scale and reach.\r\nKeep in mind that a cookie pool is simply a collection of cookies, i.e. browser-based identifications that\r\nindicate shopping preferences. While already valuable, there are ways to increase the overall relevance\r\nof ads delivered based on these cookies by enhancing them with third-party data.\r\n\r\nTying it all together, e.g. measure your efforts - Disciplined measurement is one of the keys to\r\ngenuinely successful campaigns. Practice asking your recognition partner this:\r\n\r\nWhat is my unduplicated consumer reach?\r\n\r\nTo improve each campaign, you need to ensure you are reporting the match rate by consumers\r\nmatched. And, when considering programmatic, count those who match your cookie pool and have one\r\nor more publisher cookies associated with them.\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nWhere to start?\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in adopting a more methodical approach to engaging consumers with truly relevant\r\nand contextual offers and services, you need to push for broad-based recognition and matching based\r\non g°od data, historical knowledge, cookie pools and rigorous measurement. To put a program in place\r\nthat allows you to create a cross-channel view of consumers, keep these points in mind:\r\n\r\nYOUR CHECKLIST FOR SUCCESS\r\n\r\n□\tEnsure your ad tech partners ethically us;e data to enssure\r\n\r\nconsumer privacy.\r\n\r\n□\tConsider which digital ad tech partners and ctonnels win\r\nhelp you reach your intended audience, managing for\r\naccuracy, reach and scale.\r\n\r\n□\tAsk ad tech partners to define theii\" pr°cesses to rec°gnize\r\na consumer across time, devices and channels.\r\n\r\n□\tIdentify partners that can help you apply a consistent\r\ndata strategy across all channe|s.

Consistently recognizing consumers across time and channels is the answer.\r\n\r\nA 360-degree view of the customer paves the way for truly effective cross-channel advertising.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nCHEAT SHEET\tacxi$m\r\n\r\nMARKETING CHANNEL WHAT IT IS\tHOW TO RECOGNIZE PEOPLE HERE\r\n\r\nPremium Publishers\r\n\r\nThese are websites with huge numbers of\r\nvisitors who spend long periods of time on the\r\nsites. Typically, these sites require registration,\r\nproviding the publishers with volunteered\r\ninformation about their visitors, which delivers a\r\nwealth of personally identifiable information (PII).\r\nExamples include Facebook, Amazon, eBay,\r\nYahoo and Twitter.\r\n\r\nFor the highest level of accuracy, relevance and\r\nprivacy, you want to match visitor information in\r\na neutral safe-haven sitting between your CRM\r\ndata and the publisher’s data. This requires a\r\npartnership on the front end between publisher\r\nand your recognition partner so they can utilize\r\nyour partner’s safe haven and work together to\r\nsafeguard consumer privacy.\r\n\r\nProgrammatic Media\r\n\r\nAutomated media buying and selling, enhanced\r\nwith data, programmatic advertisers are\r\ntypically targeting audiences, whereas with\r\npremium publishers brands are usually targeting\r\nconsumers. Unlike premium publishers, where\r\ntargeting is often based on PII, programmatic is\r\nusually not attributable to a given consumer.\r\n\r\nThis often leverages cookie matching, ideally\r\nthrough a partner with the largest cookie pool\r\npossible that can handle large volumes of\r\ninformation with streamlined data onboarding.\r\nSolid integrations with DMPs and other execution\r\ntools will also improve your rates of success and\r\nthe timeliness of your offers.\r\n\r\nMobile Networks\r\n\r\nCall Centers\r\n\r\nAddressable\r\nTelevision/Video\r\non Demand\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most personal of channels, mobile\r\nhas the opportunity to be king in providing\r\neverything necessary for contextual marketing.\r\nWith half of U.S. online adults owning at least\r\nthree Internet-connected devices and going\r\nonline from them multiple times a day from\r\nmultiple locations, mobile has also become\r\nthe linchpin for media consumption, offering\r\nconsumers the ability to read/watch/order/\r\nresearch any product or service — anytime,\r\nanywhere. It cannot be ignored when crafting\r\na multichannel marketing strategy.\r\n\r\nOne of the best avenues to enhance customer\r\nexperience, call centers are still a critical channel\r\nfor marketers in several industries, such as\r\nhigh-end retail, insurance, or financial services.\r\nBecause this is also one of the most expensive\r\nchannels (the longer the phone call with a\r\ncustomer, the lower the profitability), real time\r\ndata integration and recognition is paramount\r\nfor operators to solve someone’s problem on\r\nthe first call.\r\n\r\nThese providers are usually subscription-based\r\ndigital entertainment services with set-top\r\nboxes that offer the ability to send a specific\r\nTV commercial to a ZIP Code or household.\r\nExamples include: Cablevision, DirectTV, Dish\r\nNetwork, Time Warner and Comcast.\r\n\r\nWith cookies working only in some online browsers\r\nbut not in apps, one of the most common tools used\r\nto identify consumers is hindered in achieving real\r\nscale. However, it is possible to achieve optimized\r\ntargeting by identifying specific individuals based\r\non their authenticated log-in, device identification,\r\nor given PII. Marketers can then layer in past\r\nbehaviors, affinities, and the relationship with their\r\nbrand. It is imperative for marketers to now integrate\r\ntheir own first-party and CRM data to target with this\r\nlevel of granularity and personalization.\r\n\r\nThe key to recognition here is ensuring that\r\nphone numbers are included in each customer\r\nrecord, whether from a brand’s own CRM data, or\r\nappended from third party data, or can be used in\r\nreal-time not only for recognition, but also to make\r\nall the data a company has about a consumer\r\navailable to a call center associate. For example,\r\nseeing order history or knowing if they’ve been\r\nhaving difficulties on the website, may be the key\r\nto resolving an issue quickly and successfully.\r\n\r\nAddressable ads are currently available in nearly\r\n50 million households, and the number is climbing.\r\nBut, because the ads target a household, you will\r\npay a premium for this level of optimization. For that\r\nreason, you should use a process similar to what\r\nyou use for working with premium publishers with a\r\nmore surgical attention to relevance. And because\r\nof differences in technologies and data sets across\r\nproviders, be sure your recognition partner is\r\nequipped to integrate disparate technologies to\r\nmarket effectively to your intended audience.\r\n\r\nOnline Video\r\n\r\nWhile this approach is akin to addressable\r\nTV in some cases, there are actually several\r\nbusiness models for online video providers, and\r\nthe advertising opportunities vary accordingly.\r\nOnline video is quickly becoming the intersection\r\nof video/television and mobile, with consumers\r\nchoosing not only when to consume certain\r\ncontent, but also on which device, which often\r\nis a smartphone or tablet. Marketers need to\r\nconsider their ability to deliver through this\r\nemerging channel.\r\n\r\nBest practices for recognition here will depend on\r\nyour platform of choice. For marketers, devices\r\nthat stream directly from the internet, like Roku or\r\nApple TV, are similar to set-top boxes that enable\r\naddressable TV. Others that are ad-supported, like\r\nHulu, may be closer to programmatic. And don’t\r\nforget the premium publishers that have acquired\r\nonline video capabilities, like AOL with Adap.tv\r\nor Google with YouTube. Beware a vendor who\r\ntouts its ability to recognize consumers across any\r\nonline video platform; recognition here needs to be\r\naddressed on a case-by-case basis.\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nAbout Acxiom\r\n\r\nAcxiom is an enterprise data, analytics and software as a service company that uniquely fuses\r\ntrust, experience and scale to fuel data-driven results.

They are mobile. They are social. They are informed. The days of the\r\npassive consumer are gone. They want a relationship with the brands they know and trust, which requires those brands to\r\nmake them part of the conversation. That's today's connected customer experience — where brands are engaged at the\r\nindividual level and making every consumer feel important.\r\n\r\nSo what's the problem? It comes down to recognition. Many marketers lack a clear view of their customers. The closest\r\nthey get is \"kind of knowing\" who they are. Delivering an exceptional experience takes knowing customers — not\r\nguessing who or where they are. It's understanding that online and offline are one big marketing ecosystem and building\r\na strategy that doesn't sacrifice one for the other. Then it's having the insight to connect to each customer individually\r\nand build long-lasting relationships that earn trust. This is where marketing to one begins.\r\n\r\n► We can deliver that power to you.\r\n\r\nYOU NEED AN ADVANCED LEVEL OF RECOGNITION\r\n\r\nDid you know that up to 25 percent of a marketer's dataset changes each year? It's natural because change is inevitable\r\nwith people. They change jobs. They get married. They get divorced. They move. You can easily see how this leads to\r\nmillions of changes in customer information each year. Add to that the explosion of channels — web, mobile, social — in\r\naddition to traditional ones. That's why recognition has never been more important to marketers than it is right now.\r\n\r\nWhen you engage Acxiom, you harness the power of AbiliTec® — the best customer data management technology in the\r\nmarketplace. Combined with Acxiom's world-class data and intelligent recognition algorithms, it can resolve seemingly\r\ndisparate data to an individual persona. More than 45 years of historical data and patented matching technology will\r\naccurately link records, even if the information is outdated or incomplete.\r\n\r\nTHE RECOGNITION CHALLENGE\r\n\r\nEVERY DAY IN THE U.S.\r\n\r\nft ^  A\t► 161,644 PEOPLE change jobs1\t\r\n^ ^ 97,808 people move2\t^\t\t\r\nGD a\t►\t5,863 PEOPLE get married3\t►\r\n\r\n2,229\r\n\r\nPEOPLE GET DIVORCED\r\n\r\n>\r\n\r\nHH\r\n\r\nUnited State Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, http://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nUnited States Census Bureau, http://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2015/cb15-47.html\r\n3 Source: Division of Vital Statistics National Center for Health Statistics, http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/marriage_divorce_tables.htm\r\n\r\nGET A SINGLE VIEW OF EVERY CUSTOMER\r\n\r\nImagine being able to match your customers at various life stages and across touch points to build an accurate,\r\ncomprehensive customer view. You'll be able to fuel modeling, analytics and multi-channel marketing campaigns to\r\nincrease revenue, enhance customer acquisition/retention and increase lifetime customer value.\r\n\r\nWhat does it look like from your customers' perspective?

    "brochure_text": "Written evidence submitted by Jeff Silvester, Chief Operating Officer, AggregatelQ\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nI appreciate the opportunity to provide a thorough and detailed description of the work AggregatelQ\r\ndoes - as well as what we don't do - in order to provide transparency and to correct some of the\r\ninaccurate and misleading information and speculation about AggregatelQ that has been published or\r\nshared online over the last several months.\r\n\r\nThe founding of AggregatelQ\r\n\r\nAggregatelQ was created in 2011 when one of our co-founders, Zack Massingham, was working on a\r\nlocal political campaign. Zack saw there were a number of improvements that campaigns could make by\r\napplying the technology and digital tools that were commonplace in other areas. He created\r\nAggregatelQ to provide IT and web services to help campaigns use technology to better organize\r\noperations. He purchased the Aggregate!Q.com domain name in April of 2011 and used AggregatelQ as\r\na trade name for his consulting work.\r\n\r\nQuite separately, I had been working and volunteering in politics since 2005. I had been involved with a\r\nvariety of campaigns, but had recently stepped out of working in politics by the time I met Zack in 2012.\r\nBy 2013, Zack and I decided to work together. We created a new website with a new logo and formally\r\nincorporated AggregatelQ Data Services Ltd. in November of 2013.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that AggregatelQ was created by Zack Massingham and myself. Our company has\r\nalways been and continues to be 100% Canadian-owned and operated. There have only ever been two\r\ndirectors of our company, Zack and myself. The company was built by us and our employees, many of\r\nwhom have been with us since the beginning. Chris Wylie has never been an employee of AggregatelQ,\r\nhas never done contract work for us, and has never had any role in any operations of the company.\r\n\r\nOur early work for SCL Elections\r\n\r\nChris Wylie did reach out to us in his role with SCL Elections to ask for some advice on a project he was\r\nputting together. He did introduce AIQ to SCL. And AIQ did agree to build a political customer\r\nrelationship management (CRM) tool for a political party in Trinidad and Tobago on contract for SCL.\r\nThis contract work started in late 2013, and was completed in early 2014.\r\n\r\nIn early 2014, after the work in Trinidad and Tobago, SCL asked us to help them build an entirely new\r\npolitical CRM tool for use in state races during the American 2014 midterm elections. As part of the\r\ncontract, SCL required that we transfer the intellectual property rights and ownership of the software\r\nthat AIQ wrote for them. SCL called the tool Ripon. The work started in April of 2014 and the tool was\r\ndesigned to help political campaigns with typical campaign activity such as door-knocking, phone-\r\ncalling and emailing. In October of the mid-term cycle we also placed online ads for SCL on behalf of\r\ntheir respective clients. This work concluded in November of 2014 when the midterm elections ended.\r\nWe subsequently worked with SCL on similar software development, online advertising and website\r\ndevelopment during the US presidential primary from March 2015 to May 2016.\r\n\r\nAs has been reported, AIQ did help SCL with some online advertising for a campaign in Nigeria in 2015. It\r\nwas during this campaign that a very graphic and disturbing video surfaced. We saw the video, and we\r\nwere asked to promote the video with online advertising, but we refused. We do not know who\r\nproduced the video. After this frankly disturbing incident, we began adding language to our standard\r\ncontracts to address ethics in advertising.\r\n\r\nAs with all of our work, at the conclusion of each of our contracts with SCL, we destroyed any\r\ninformation in our possession from those campaigns.\r\n\r\nUntil 2015, SCL was certainly our largest client, but not our only client and we were always completely\r\nindependent and had no cross ownership, nor any cross board membership. In fact, the last contact we\r\nhad with SCL was shortly after the conclusion of our work on the US presidential primaries in May of\r\n2016. It consisted only of a request from SCL to us to transfer the code for the political CRM that they\r\nhad paid for, and from us to them to get our final invoice paid. We have not done any work for them or\r\nany of their group of companies, nor have we communicated with them since.\r\n\r\nFalse allegations of connections to Cambridge Analytica\r\n\r\nAs described above, we did software development and online advertising work for SCL on contract.\r\n\r\nAside from having done that work for them, we have no corporate ties, legal or otherwise, to SCL or any\r\nindividuals associated with them. We have never worked for, contracted with, nor have any corporate\r\nties, legal or otherwise to Cambridge Analytica or any individuals associated with them. We understand\r\nthere has been some confusion around this point in SCL internal email messages shared with the UK\r\nParliament. The reality is we have always been a completely separate legal entity and suggestion of any\r\nother relationship, whether misconstrued internally or externally, is untrue.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, we were alerted by a journalist that SCL had published Zack Massingham's phone number on\r\nits website under the heading \"SCL Canada.\" We had no knowledge of this listing prior to the call from\r\nthe journalist. We have never been contacted by anyone thinking we were SCL Canada and we never\r\nreferred any work or clients to SCL. SCL did ask us in early 2014 to establish \"SCL Canada\" on its behalf.\r\nWe declined. It appears that SCL likely adopted that term internally without our knowledge or consent.\r\nWhen contacted by that same journalist for comment, SCL removed the number and acknowledged it\r\ndid not accurately describe our relationship.\r\n\r\nWe did become aware in 2014 of a company called Cambridge Analytica (CA) and that it had some kind\r\nof business relationship with SCL. We understood that CA was an American firm based in New York, and\r\nthat SCL was a UK firm based in London. We were not aware of the details of their particular business\r\nrelationship. We knew CA worked on the US primary campaign concurrently with SCL. However, we\r\nonly worked as a contractor to SCL, our instructions came from SCL, and we were paid by SCL.\r\n\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to address a document provided to the UK Parliament as \"evidence\"\r\nthat we had a contractual relationship with CA. The document resembles a contract we signed with\r\nSCL. However, we had never seen the document prior to news reports about it. We have no knowledge\r\nof, and can say nothing about, whether that document with the joint SCL/CA letterhead is genuine or\r\notherwise. It has nothing to do with AIQ, we never had any such relationship as might be implied by that\r\ndocument, and we note that it is unsigned. As mentioned above, we have never signed any contract\r\nwith CA.\r\n\r\nVoter Information and the \"Kogan data\r\n\r\nWhile supporting SCL's Ripon political CRM in 2014, we became aware that SCL had and was\r\ndeveloping models for predicting voter personality with the help of a Dr. Kogan from Cambridge\r\nUniversity. However, we were never involved in nor exposed to any data modeling or data analytics. We\r\nhave never met nor had any interaction with Dr. Kogan. Nor have we ever seen or had access to the\r\nFacebook data Dr. Kogan is said to have used. We have never managed, had access to, nor used any\r\nFacebook data allegedly improperly obtained by CA or by anyone else. In fact, recently, while speaking\r\nto your committee on Fake News, the Chief Technology Officer of Facebook confirmed that AggregatelQ\r\ndid not use any improperly obtained Facebook data during the UK Referendum.\r\n\r\nThe only personal information we use in our work is that which is provided to us by our clients for\r\nspecific purposes. In doing so, we believe we comply with all applicable privacy laws in each jurisdiction\r\nwhere we work.\r\n\r\nThe UK Referendum\r\n\r\nIn April of 2016, after an acquaintance who was consulting with Vote Leave at the time let us know that\r\nVote Leave was looking for a contractor to provide digital advertising services, we submitted a poposal\r\nto the Vote Leave campaign. On April 12th, we were informed that we were the preferred choice of the\r\ncampaign. On April 13th, the Vote Leave campaign was given the designation as the official \"Leave\"\r\ncampaign in the referendum.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign, in addition to the online advertising, we provided limited website, software\r\ndevelopment, and IT support. Our work with Vote Leave continued through to the vote on June 23,\r\n\r\n2016. The only information we used in our work for Vote Leave was the information that was provided\r\nto us by Vote Leave.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the referendum, we also provided online advertising services to BeLeave, Veterans for\r\nBritain, and the DUP. In each case the work we did was directed by each of our clients independently.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our work for BeLeave we submitted a variety of invoices and digital advertising insertion\r\norders (similar to a purchase order but for advertising services). We were informed by Darren Grimes of\r\nBeLeave that Vote Leave would be providing a donation to BeLeave, and that BeLeave asked that the\r\ndonation be sent directly to us to pay for our services and advertising costs.\r\n\r\nAs part of our due diligence we conducted research into the appropriateness of the payment method.\r\nThe people responsible for compliance at Vote Leave assured us that such a donation was allowed.\r\nThey also told us the Electoral Commission had written to them to confirm the legality of a similar\r\nsituation Vote Leave had already been in. Indeed, after the vote, in March of 2017, the Electoral\r\nCommission reviewed the donation and found that no further investigation was required and the UK\r\nHigh Court has recently confirmed, again (hearing of March 15, 2018), that a donation, whether of\r\ncash or kind, was entirely allowed under Electoral Law in the UK.\r\n\r\nWe have never thought that the work we did for any of our clients during the referendum was anything\r\nbut above board - legally and ethically. We have no reason to believe that there was any content shared\r\nbetween the campaigns we worked for, nor did we see any evidence of coordination. As a small\r\norganization it was necessary for our CEO to know some details of more than one campaign. In terms\r\n\r\nof the generic expertise we were hired to provide, creating and placing online ads through platforms like\r\nFacebook and Google, we gave that expertise equally and fully to all our clients. Nonetheless,\r\ncampaigns were kept entirely separate from each other and we did not share plans or information of\r\nany client with any other client.\r\n\r\nOngoing privacy investigations\r\n\r\nAggregatelQ works in full compliance within all legal and regulatory requirements in all jurisdictions\r\nwhere it operates. We have been cooperating fully with the joint investigation by the Canadian and BC\r\nPrivacy Commissioners and are looking forward to any recommendations they might have on how we\r\ncan improve our practices.\r\n\r\nWe also strongly believe that we have been cooperating with the UK Information Commissioner's Office\r\nand its investigation into the use of data analytics in political campaigns. So it came as a surprise to us\r\nwhen a member of the Canadian Parliament's Standing Committee on Information, Privacy and Ethics\r\nreceived an SMS text from the Chair of this committee while we were testifying in real-time to the\r\nCanadian committee suggesting that we weren't being cooperative.\r\n\r\nWe are on the record - and will state again here - that the UK ICO sent us a letter on May 17, 2017, to\r\nwhich we replied promptly. We heard nothing from the UK ICO until we received a letter from them\r\nsome eight months later on January 30, 2018, to which we also replied promptly. Our impression was\r\nthat by responding to the UK ICO's letters promptly and as thoroughly as we could, we were cooperating\r\nwith its investigation. We did not receive any indication in the two letters from the UK ICO that they\r\nbelieved we were not cooperating and the Commissioner's recent statement that we refused to answer\r\nany further questions is simply not true.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we did follow up with the UK ICO after our hearing in front of the Canadian Parliamentary\r\ncommittee. Having now received a letter in response from the UK ICO, a subsequent letter with\r\nadditional questions from the UK ICO, and a variety of positive email communication back and forth with\r\nhigh ranking officials in the UK ICO, we believe we have resolved this apparent miscommunication and\r\nwe look forward to continuing to cooperate with the UK ICO's investigation.\r\n\r\nHow we protect personal information\r\n\r\nThe only personal information we use in our work is that which is provided to us by our clients for\r\nspecific purposes. This might include lists of emails or voter contact information for use in political CRM\r\nsoftware used by campaigns. We also might receive a list of names and email addresses to include in\r\nadvertising campaigns to assist in showing ads to groups of Facebook users who are supporters of a\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nIn all of the cases where we receive or have access to information for a campaign, we only use this\r\ninformation for the purposes it was provided. We always encourage our clients to inform potential\r\nvisitors to their websites in clear and understandable language how any of the information they provide\r\nmight be used and how that information can be removed later if desired.\r\n\r\nAny personal information that is provided to AggregatelQ is kept on secure servers with security\r\nprotocols that meet or exceed industry standards. Where possible, personal information is tokenized or\r\nanonymized and the original information deleted. This information is never shared between any of our\r\n\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nAt the end of our engagement with a client or at any time before that when any information is no longer\r\nrequired, we return the information to our client and destroy it from our systems.\r\n\r\nThe unauthorized access to our code repository\r\n\r\nWe acknowledge that, while we always endeavour to observe and exceed industry privacy standards,\r\nwe don't always get everything right.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, March 25th, we were alerted by a journalist to unauthorized access to an Aggregate IQ code\r\nrepository. We took immediate steps to secure that server as well as all of our servers and services to\r\nensure no further access was possible.\r\n\r\nDuring the process of securing the server and investigating how the unauthorized access had occurred,\r\nwe discovered that some personal information from voters was inadvertently left in one of the code\r\nbackups. Within a few hours of the initial report by the media, in addition to notifying our clients, we\r\ncontacted the Acting Deputy Commissioner from the Office of the Information and Privacy\r\nCommissioner of British Columbia and we launched a full and thorough investigation. That investigation\r\nis still ongoing.\r\n\r\nWhat I can say at this time is that the information accessed by the security researcher is primarily\r\nsoftware code, but also included contact information for supporters and voters from a few of our past\r\nclients. None of these files contained any individual financial, password or other sensitive information,\r\nand none of the personal information came from the Brexit campaign. That there was any personal\r\ninformation in our code repository at all was a mistake on our part. For that we apologize. We have\r\nalready put in place measures to prevent that from happening again, and as we complete our\r\ninvestigation we anticipate there may be additional recommendations and improvements that can be\r\nmade. The Federal and Provincial Privacy Commissioners may also have recommendations. We welcome\r\nand will act upon them. We are committed to ensuring that this investigation is done thoroughly and\r\ndone right.\r\n\r\nWorking with Facebook\r\n\r\nWe have always operated within the Facebook terms of service and we have never managed, had\r\naccess to, nor even seen the Facebook data allegedly improperly obtained by Cambridge Analytica or\r\nMr. Kogen.\r\n\r\nWe understand that Facebook reported to this committee that they found some apparent\r\nadministrative links between AIQ and CA on the Facebook platform. We don't know what they are\r\nreferring to, and they have not provided this information to us. We have reached out to Facebook and\r\nhave been told that they were instructed by the UK ICO not to communicate substantively with us\r\nwhile their investigation is ongoing. We have written to the UK ICO to demand that they rescind this\r\norder. Nevertheless, we are looking forward to discussing this matter fully and resolving this issue with\r\nFacebook so we can continue to be a good customer of theirs.\r\n\r\nWhen we create an advertising campaign for a client we use the services available on advertising\r\nplatforms like Facebook and Google. Facebook provides a platform that allows an advertiser to show ads\r\n\r\nto its users based on criteria such as demographic information like age range or sex, geographic\r\ninformation like cities or states, and interests that people may have identified on Facebook. All of this\r\nallows a campaign to run a very complex and comprehensive advertising campaign without the need\r\nfor any external information. Typically a campaign will provide us with a general description of the\r\nsort of voters they believe will support them. An example might be conservative voters outside of cities,\r\nolder than 39 years of age. We would place this information into the Facebook platform along with\r\nthe ads that we create at the direction of the client. Each ad consists of a picture, often with a few\r\nwords on it, along with some descriptive text and a link to a webpage should someone click on the ad.\r\nWe also sometimes assist in creating that web or \"landing\" page. We then work with the client to decide\r\nhow many times people should see these ads and over what time period. The Facebook platform\r\ntakes care of the rest, showing these ads to its users and providing reports on how many times the ads\r\nhave been shown and how many times the ads have been clicked. None of that information includes any\r\npersonal information. Facebook also gives advertisers the ability to count the number of people who\r\nmight land on a certain webpage on the client site using a piece of code called a pixel. We often help our\r\nclients place this Facebook pixel code on their site so that the client can measure if a particular ad is\r\nreaching its goal to show people a video, versus signing up to be on a mailing list for example.\r\n\r\nNone of this requires any external data. Facebook's advertising platform has everything you need to\r\ncreate a national campaign without needing to see any personal information. Facebook already has\r\ninformation on the vast majority of Canadian, American, and UK Citizens that it keeps securely within its\r\nsystem. It does not share any of this information with advertisers. When you place ads on the Facebook\r\nplatform, Facebook uses its own algorithms and techniques to show the ads to individuals. You don't\r\nneed your own data to do this - and even if you had your own data, it is likely not going to be as\r\neffective as just using Facebook. Allegations that AIQ or anyone would benefit from using information\r\nallegedly improperly obtained from Facebook in 2013 predominantly or wholly from US citizens to\r\ntarget UK citizens in a UK referendum in 2016 makes no sense. Again, the Facebook advertising platform\r\nprovides all the necessary information and tools based on current and relevant Facebook information,\r\nand the speed of execution means advertising decisions can be put into effect within minutes.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nAs I stated at the outset, much of what has been said about AggregatelQ by those who neither know nor\r\nrepresent us, has been largely inaccurate. With all due respect to this committee, \"fake news\" cuts both\r\nways, and can sometimes come from unexpected, and normally reliable sources. In fact, the media\r\noutlet leading the charge against us - The Guardian - has had to publish corrections about our\r\ninvolvement in this issue:\r\n\r\n\"[W]e did not intend to suggest that Aggregate IQ is a direct part and/or the Canadian branch of\r\nCambridge Analytica, or that it has been involved in the exploitation of Facebook data, or otherwise\r\nbeen involved in any of the alleged wrongdoing made against Cambridge Analytica. Further, we did not\r\nintend to suggest that AIQ secretly and unethically co-ordinated with Cambridge Analytica on the EU\r\nreferendum.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, corrections on page 50 of a newspaper do not get as much attention as a headline on\r\nthe front page.\r\n\r\nIn closing, we have at all times acted ethically, legally and with full respect to personal privacy. We have\r\nattempted to provide clear and accurate information to regulators, to the media, to elected officials, our\r\n\r\nclients and the public. We will continue to do so. We thank you for taking the time to hear us, and we\r\nlook forward to addressing any further questions you may have.\r\n\r\nMay 2018",

    "brochure_text": "Supplementary written evidence submitted by Chris Wylie\r\n\r\nA RESPONSE TO MISSTATEMENTS IN RELATION TO CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA\r\nINTRODUCTORY BACKGROUND TO THE COMPANIES\r\n\r\nMr Wylie was the Director of Research for SCL and Cambridge Analytica from 2013 to the end of 2014.\r\nSCL Group is a UK-based military contractor that specialises in Information Operations (“IO”). SCL’s\r\nclients have included the UK Ministry of Defence, US Department of Defense and various NATO\r\nmilitaries. Information Operations is the area of military strategy that deploys, manipulates or weaponises\r\ninformation to support operational objectives. Within IO, there are related fields such as Psychological\r\nOperations and Cyber Operations.\r\n\r\nIt is important to highlight that as IO is a military strategy, which is often deployed in combat situations\r\nwhere the Data Protection Act would not apply, many IO approaches are not generally congruent with the\r\nData Protection Principles. This is because there are two key objectives of IO. The first is the notion of\r\n“informational dominance”, which focuses on capturing, interfering or manipulating as many channels of\r\ninformation surrounding the target as possible. This is typically done, by necessity, without the\r\nknowledge of the target. The second is using information collected about the target to identify and then\r\nexploit mental vulnerabilities to provoke certain behaviours in the target that would be conducive to\r\noperational objectives.\r\n\r\nCambridge Analytica (“CA”) was created by SCL Group with funding from Robert Mercer, an American\r\nbillionaire based in New York. Robert Mercer installed the alt-right political activist Stephen Bannon as\r\nCA’s Vice President with responsibilities to manage the company day-to-day. Mr Mercer wanted to use\r\nthe IO tactics SCL had used on military projects for his political aims in the United States, and elsewhere,\r\nincluding the United Kingdom. CA’s focus was to adapt these strategies for politics, as well as research\r\nways to modernise and deploy IO approaches in online social networks. CA does not have any staff, only\r\nan intellectual property licence and data assets. SCL licenced all its IP to CA and in return CA signed an\r\nexclusive service provision agreement whereby all CA clients would be handed to SCL staff to work on.\r\nAlthough there are technical legal distinctions between CA and SCL, this is largely to get around various\r\nelectoral compliance and foreign agent restrictions in the USA. It should be noted that in practice CA and\r\nSCL operate day-to-day as the same company. The two companies share the same offices and many of\r\nthe same directors.\r\n\r\nAggregate IQ (“AIQ”) is a Canadian company that was set up to service SCL and later CA projects and\r\nbuild database, CRM and online advertising technologies for SCL/CA. Prior to SCL, AIQ had no other\r\nclients. The reason AIQ was set up originally was because several key people, who later became the\r\nprinciple officers of AIQ, were not mobile to move to London for family reasons. The compromise was to\r\nestablish a company in Canada and IP agreements would be reached so that SCL/CA would own the\r\nproducts of their work. To the best of Mr Wylie’s knowledge, AIQ had no independent clients outside of\r\nSCL/CA from 2013 to 2016. The IP licence and contracts between AIQ and CA/SCL are in the\r\npossession of the committee. AIQ was listed as “SCL Canada” on the SCL website and internal staff lists\r\nin the possession of the committee also lists Zack Massingham, the CEO of AIQ, as “Head of SCL\r\nCanada”. These staff lists also show that AIQ was responsible for hiring and managing a division of\r\nSCL/CA’s software engineers.\r\n\r\nFACEBOOK DATA AND PSYCHOGRAPHICS\r\n\r\n“Cambridge Analytica has not processed Facebook data.”\r\n\r\nThis has been the historic line used by Cambridge Analytica [“CA”]. Alexander Nix said to both the UK\r\nParliament and US Congress that the firm did not possess or use Facebook data.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the firm hired Global Science Research [“GSR”] Dr Kogan’s consulting company, to use an\r\napplication to harvest millions of Facebook records for use in psychological profiling. This is evidenced\r\nby the GSR contract published by the DCMS Select Committee at the UK Parliament. The contract\r\nincludes very specific language that the origin of the data would be from Facebook and that friend data\r\nwould also be harvested in that process. In fact, harvesting friend data was presented as the core unique\r\nselling point for this approach. The CEO of CA Alexander Nix signed that contract. Extensive email\r\ncorrespondence given to the committee also shows the use of Facebook data, some of which has also\r\nbeen published.\r\n\r\nThere is also video recording of CA staff discussing modelling Facebook like data from November 2015\r\n(https://youtu.be/IhvX9QCiZP0). The staff member describes the same process for modelling Facebook\r\ndata as the original GSR project.\r\n\r\n“The data received from GSR were derivatives, not Facebook data.”\r\n\r\nThis is merely a semantic distinction. Derivatives simply mean that the origin source data has been\r\nprocessed or transformed in some way, but the underlying information is still preserved. Facebook terms\r\nand conditions are inclusive of derivatives in its definition of Facebook data. Global Science Research\r\nprovided Cambridge Analytica with processed Facebook derivatives that were in a format that could be\r\neasily ingested into its modelling operation.\r\n\r\nA simple way to think about derivatives is when you translate a French text into English. In that case,\r\nEnglish would be a derivative, as the “data format” is now different, but the underlying information is\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\n“This was standard practice at the time and allowed by Facebook.”\r\n\r\nIt is true that Cambridge Analytica exploited vulnerabilities in how Facebook was set up at the time. This\r\ndoes not mean, however, that this was permitted or compliant with the Data Protection Act.\r\n\r\n“The Obama campaign did the same thing.”\r\n\r\nThe Obama campaign did not use a foreign military contractor to develop psychological profiling\r\nalgorithms using misappropriated Facebook data on upwards of 87 million unsuspecting data subjects.\r\n\r\n“GSR put in the terms and conditions that it may sell the data.”\r\n\r\nGSR did have a term in the app terms and conditions that said it may sell or transfer the data. However,\r\nno terms and conditions can override the law. This means that while the primary app user may have\r\ntechnically consented to their data being used, the law does not give a friend permission to consent on\r\nbehalf of another person.\r\n\r\n“The GSR contract said it complied with the Data Protection Act.”\r\n\r\nYes, but this does not mean that it actually did. As data controllers, both Cambridge Analytica and GSR\r\nhad a substantive duty to ensure that data it was acquiring was done so with consent and in compliance\r\nwith the DPA.\r\n\r\n“Mr Wylie was the manager for the GSR project, so he is responsible for it.”\r\n\r\nCambridge Analytica is the Data Controller, not Mr Wylie. Mr Wylie did not authorise and sign the GSR\r\ncontract, the firm’s CEO Alexander Nix did. Mr Wylie did not fund, scale or expand the project,\r\nCambridge Analytica did. Mr Wylie did not carry out the Facebook data harvesting, GSR and Dr Kogan\r\ndid. When Mr Wylie left CA, the firm still continued with the GSR project.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr Wylie has been fully open and transparent about his role in setting up Cambridge Analytica\r\nand his role on the GSR project. By going public, he has gone out of his way, at much personal expense,\r\nto try to correct the mistakes that were made. He has accepted his share of responsibility. It is the case\r\nfor most whistleblowers that they were involved in some way in the problems that they later choose to\r\nreport. It was Mr Wylie, not Cambridge Analytica or GSR, who decided to come forward to report the\r\nproject to the authorities or media.\r\n\r\n“No Facebook data was used on the Trump campaign.”\r\n\r\nThe basis of all CA models, including political affiliation and turnout models, were originally trained using\r\nthe Facebook derived GSR data. Even if Facebook data itself was not used directly on the Trump\r\ncampaign, the algorithms were still built using Facebook derivatives.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is public domain that Trump’s voter targeting operation, called Project Alamo, made extensive\r\nuse of Facebook targeting and Facebook also had staff embedded with the Trump campaign. Cambridge\r\nAnalytica also worked on Project Alamo, so it is difficult to believe that they did not come into contact or\r\nmake use of Facebook data.\r\n\r\n“No psychographic data was used on the Trump campaign because there was no time.”\r\n\r\nCambridge Analytica has previously said that there was “no time” to “update” the psychographic models\r\nused on the Cruz campaign for Trump because they only officially joined in late summer 2016. However,\r\nthis makes no sense because voter personality is an enduring characteristic (like gender) and so there\r\nwould be no need to “update” the models. It would be like saying that because the firm was switching\r\ncampaigns they would also have to “update” the gender of all records.\r\n\r\nFurther, the firm had been in contact with the Trump campaign for far longer than it cares to admit.\r\nCambridge Analytica lawyers confirmed to Mr Wylie that Alexander Nix met with the soon-to-be Trump\r\ncampaign manager Corey Lewendowski back in spring 2015, before Trump had even announced his\r\ncampaign. Mr Nix discussed with Mr Lewendowski the use of Facebook derived data and\r\npsychographics at that meeting. Legal correspondence from CA referencing these meetings are in the\r\npossession of the committee.\r\n\r\n“Cambridge Analytica only uses commercial data to do psychographics.”\r\n\r\nThis is difficult to believe because internal reports, which have been passed to the committee, show that\r\nthe commercial data that the firm says they use do not have strong relationships with nuanced constructs.\r\nAlso the commercial data the firm uses has a high degree of “matrix sparsity” which means that although\r\nthere may be “4,000-5,000” features in the dataset, most records are actually blank for those features.\r\nMany features only have a coverage rate of only 2-5% which means that 95-98% of voters in the dataset\r\ndo not have an observation for that feature. This is why the “4,000-5,000 data points” claim is misleading,\r\nas it refers to a feature set of possible observations, but it does not mean that the coverage is high. So\r\nthe commercial data referred to in the internal reports would not have been useful for psychological\r\ntargeting as it did not contain enough information to be effective.\r\n\r\n“AIQ did not have access to any Facebook derived data.”\r\n\r\nThe data security firm UpGuard revealed exposed code repositories that showed AIQ developers working\r\non code for Cambridge Analytica’s Ripon software in August 2015. Ripon was the platform CA used to\r\n\r\ndeploy targeting derived from the misappropriated Facebook data. In fact, internal emails in the\r\npossession of the committee show senior AIQ staff discussing accessing the “Kogan data” from SCL/CA’s\r\nservers for the Bolton PAC.\r\n\r\n“There is no evidence that psychological profiling works.”\r\n\r\nThe following studies highlight the efficacy of using social media, natural language or Internet clickstream\r\ndata for psychological profiling or mass persuasion:\r\n\r\n•\tEichstaedt, J.

However, a clear risk of data breaches was created by CA’s\r\napparent recklessness in the face of highly skilled foreign intelligence and cyber operations.\r\n\r\nDuring the Facebook harvesting scheme, the lead psychologist on the project, Dr Aleksandr Kogan was\r\nalso working on a Russian-funded research project at St Petersburg University on scaled psychological\r\nprofiling of data subjects. Dr Kogan’s research focused on online trolls and Dark Triad personality traits\r\n(Machiavellianism, Narcissism and Psychopathy).\r\n\r\nContemporaneous to Dr Kogan’s psychological profiling and online troll research in Russia, CA was also\r\nin close contact with senior executives at Lukoil, one of Russia’s largest oil companies. After receiving a\r\nrequest for information from Lukoil about CA’s work in the spring of 2014, CA discussed with Lukoil its\r\nexperience with foreign disinformation, rumour campaigns, microtargeting and its data assets from Ripon.\r\nThis is documented in correspondence and slide decks in the committee’s possession. As a note, CA’s\r\nhistory of working in Nigeria is a focus of this presentation.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Lukoil has formal information sharing agreements with the Russian Federal\r\nSecurity Service (“FSB”) and is known to conduct intelligence gathering on behalf of the FSB with\r\nEuropean companies it engages.\r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that CA’s parent company, SCL Group, manages NATO psychological operations\r\nprojects in the Baltic region and would have likely already been an intelligence target for the FSB. This\r\nmeans that in addition to processing Facebook data in Russia, there are reasonable grounds to suspect\r\nthat CA may have been an intelligence target of Russian security services at the time of Project Ripon,\r\nthat the FSB may have been notified of the existence of CA’s Facebook data and that they could covertly\r\naccess those same data assets inside Russia via accessing Dr Kogan’s work and computers. There are\r\nalso reasonable grounds to investigate the extent of Dr Kogan’s knowledge of any such accessing.\r\n\r\nAs Data Controller, CA ",

    "brochure_text": "Written evidence submitted by Brittany Kaiser\r\n\r\nI want to thank the British Parliament for this opportunity to bear witness to the inquiry on Fake News. As a\r\nbeliever in truth, universal human rights and democracy, I understand that fake news undermines these ideals\r\nand threatens everything we hold dear, but it is just a symptom of a deeper problem. The elite have spent too\r\nmany years using technology to take advantage of the people’s openness and goodwill. I can no longer stand\r\nby while the privileged abuse their power, intentionally or unintentionally. I want to help shed light in dark\r\nplaces, and to help people be more responsible in their actions. This is why I spoke out originally, and this is\r\nwhy I have returned to the UK willingly and at my own expense to testify to this inquiry.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of background, I was born in Houston, Texas, and grew up in Chicago. I went to high school at\r\nPhillips Academy Andover outside of Boston, then moved to Edinburgh to study two of my lifelong passions:\r\ninternational relations and human rights. During my academic studies, I volunteered on the presidential\r\ncampaign of Howard Dean and the senatorial campaign of Barack Obama, before becoming part of the small\r\nnew media team on Obama’s presidential campaign in 2007/8.\r\n\r\nI then spent several years working on human rights projects around the world, including work for Amnesty\r\nInternational, lobbying at the United Nations and European Parliament to stop crimes against humanity, and\r\ncontributing to human rights research projects in Asia; while pursuing further postgraduate degrees in human\r\nrights law, diplomacy and development. I began to focus on how social change projects could become more\r\neffective, for example through data-driven early warning systems against genocide. I also worked on\r\ninternational trade and development, and worked around the world as a freelance political consultant.\r\n\r\nI first met Alexander Nix when I was working with Democrats Abroad in London. I think it was 2013. Friends\r\nof ours thought it would be a good joke to introduce us as he was consulting to the Republican Party. He was\r\nvery interested in learning more about my experience with the Democrats. He gave me his card and said, “Let\r\nme get you drunk and steal your secrets”. I didn’t call him.\r\n\r\nWe met coincidentally a few times after that; and in December 2014, he offered me a job. I wanted to find a\r\nway to be more effective in campaigning and positive social change, and his firm Strategic Communications\r\nLaboratories (SCL) boasted of scientifically valid methods of measuring effectiveness. I have always wanted\r\nus to use power for good, not ill. The first project I worked on with SCL was on driving engagement for\r\nreconstruction of ebola-stricken countries.\r\n\r\nI began at SCL Group as a part-time consultant with the title of special adviser. I became full-time in February\r\n2015, and left in January 2018. My job title was left to me. My focus was on sales and business development, a\r\nfield in which titles are often inflated. I called myself Director of Program Development initially; this then\r\nchanged to Director of Business Development.\r\n\r\nAt no time was I part of the executive leadership or top management team of SCL or Cambridge Analytica -\r\nalthough I wanted to be, and I believe I contributed hugely to the success of the company. I was never an\r\nofficer of the board of any of the companies. I was also not a data scientist or someone with access to\r\ncontroversial datasets. Since I left, I have been learning just how many secrets the management team were\r\nkeeping me out of, and looking back with fresh eyes on emails I was copied in to and other documents.\r\n\r\nMy job at Cambridge Analytica was primarily to meet potential clients, hear what they wanted and required,\r\nand brief the operations team in order to produce a sales proposal, often under the guidance of senior managers\r\nand executives like CEO Alexander Nix, CFO/COO Julian Wheatland, and Chief Data Officer Alex Tayler. I\r\nhad access to company materials on products and services, account management, and to potential and current\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nMy testimony here is informed by what I witnessed and experienced during my time at Cambridge Analytica\r\nand SCL, and materials I worked on or was copied in to. When I originally spoke to The Guardian in March\r\n2018, I provided relevant materials from my Cambridge Analytica inbox. I was locked out of my files, but later\r\nfound an offline copy of my SCL inbox with further materials.\r\n\r\nI would now like to submit the following specific testimony and supporting packages of evidence:\r\n\r\nBrexit, UKIP & Eldon Insurance\r\n\r\nCambridge Analytica was initially engaged with Arron Banks, Andy Wigmore and Matthew Richardson to\r\ndesign parallel proposals for Leave.EU, GoSkippy/Eldon Insurance and the UK Independence Party. I was\r\nasked by Nix and Wheatland to take the lead on contract negotiations. I believe this is because, as upper class\r\nBrits, they did not want to front up the deal with him themselves. Banks was excited to discover my\r\nbackground with the Obama campaign.\r\n\r\nOver a period of five months, we undertook both meetings and work at the Bristol headquarters of Eldon\r\nInsurance, the SCL Group offices in Mayfair, and the Leave.EU London offices in Millbank Tower, as well as\r\na press launch and media engagements. Our work for UKIP/Leave.EU was never reported to the Electoral\r\nCommission by the party, the campaign, or our company.\r\n\r\nAt the time, I didn’t see anything wrong in what was being proposed. I am not a data lawyer or an expert in\r\nUK elections law; and we included caveats in our proposals about requiring legal advice before proceeding\r\nwith some elements of the project. Arron Banks said, “It’s my data” - it seemed natural that he would use it\r\nacross his initiatives. I was also reassured by a legal opinion arranged by former UKIP party secretary\r\nMatthew Richardson from Toby Coppell QC to UKIP and Cambridge Analytica, an opinion which Richardson\r\nco-signed in a manner which seems somewhat unorthodox in retrospect. I am providing this document now to\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, I now think that there is reason to believe that misuse of data was rife amongst the businesses and\r\ncampaigns of Arron Banks. If the personal data of UK citizens who just wanted to buy car insurance was used\r\nby GoSkippy and Eldon Insurance for political purposes, as may have been the case, people clearly did not opt\r\nin for their data to be used in this way by Leave.EU. I have similar concerns about whether UKIP members\r\nconsented to the use of their data.\r\n\r\nFor example, I went to Bristol with a senior data scientist to spend the day with the Leave.Eu team. We started\r\nthe work day by presenting to the heads of every department (social media, call center, IT/data, creative,\r\nevents) to show them how Cambridge Analytica uses data and would be supporting the Leave.Eu campaign.\r\nAfter the general presentation we went to work with each department to assess which kinds of data they had,\r\n\r\nhow they were being used and what kinds of capacity the team possessed. When we were with the call center\r\nteam, we enquired on the databases being used for the calls, which I was told were from the insurance\r\ncompany. It seemed to me that the datasets and the staff were being used for Eldon/GoSkippy Insurance as\r\nwell as Leave.eu in parallel.\r\n\r\nArron Banks refused to pay our phase 1 bill of £41,500 for work undertaken, despite what I was told by Julian\r\nWheatland was a firm commitment by Leave.EU chief executive and Banks associate Liz Bilney to do so. I\r\nhave no memory of seeing or hearing about the invoice later sent to UKIP for this work, which has recently\r\nbeen revealed in the media. I understand that Banks made a donation of £42,000 to UKIP a week before the\r\nreferendum vote, perhaps to tidy things up. But I had and have no evidence around this; and I understand that\r\nno payment was ever made to Cambridge Analytica by UKIP. To the best of my knowledge, our work with\r\nUKIP and Leave.EU never made it into any report to the Electoral Commission.\r\n\r\nFinally, I was recently made aware of a data company set up by Arron Banks called “Big Data Dolphins”, soon\r\nafter he ceased negotiations with Cambridge Analytica and declined to pay our phase 1 bill.\r\n\r\nThis company has reportedly worked with a data science team at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss). If\r\nthe Mississippi team has held or processed UK citizens’ data in the US, I believe that is likely to be a criminal\r\noffence; although it is for the empowered authorities to pursue any such question and secure the associated\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, based on what I now know, I believe that Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore have serious\r\nquestions to answer. They should perhaps themselves be summoned to testify before Parliament. I do not\r\nbelieve Banks’s written evidence to this inquiry is a full account of what happened. I also hope that evidence\r\ncan be preserved.\r\n\r\nI am submitting the following supporting materials on Brexit to the inquiry:\r\n\r\n1. GoSkippy Proposal and supporting emails\r\n\r\na.\tGoSkippy original proposal document\r\n\r\nb.\tGoSkippyl email thread regarding scheduling a follow up meeting at Leave.EU offices in\r\nBristol, where I write on January 8, 2016: \"I recall before the holidays we spoke about Aaron\r\nbeing available in Bristol next week on Wednesday and Thursday the 13/14. Are these dates\r\nstill a possibility? My team does not mind coming down to Bristol as we have pending\r\nmeetings with other members of the Leave.EU teams as well as GoSkippy departments.\"\r\n\r\n2.

As we discussed, we will make sure that the Target Audience\r\n\r\nAnalysis (TAA) suits the purposes of Leave as well as UKIP and we will try to seed some\r\nquestions into the survey that will help inform future study of insurance risk profiling. Once\r\nwe have completed the TAA and matched it to the Experian data we will be in a position to\r\nstart microtargeting and, at that time, we would propose that we start digital outreach and a\r\nprogram of voter engagement and fundraising. However, following our discussion yesterday\r\non the way you are using Facebook (and chatting it over with our Head of Digital Marketing\r\nafterwards), it occurred to me that you may like us to take over you current list-building\r\nactivity in the interim. From what you’ve said, I’m certain we could improve the effectiveness\r\nand yieldfrom current activities and that would give us a stronger base for the fundraising\r\nprogramme in the New Year.”\r\n\r\nd.\tEmail Leave2, I write to confirm with Julian Wheatland that our budget is approved by\r\nLeave.EU as follows: \"In your last full chats with Liz, she said the budget was approved and\r\nwe were awaiting approval for the payment schedule, etc, is that correct? Anyhow, would you\r\nlike me to contact Frances, whom I've been liaising with on Aaron's schedule, to get\r\nsomething in the calendar for the week of January 4th?” His response is \"Yes that’s correct\r\nand yes please.\"\r\n\r\ne.\tEmail thread Leave3, Pierre Shepard, Leave.EU Head of Research, writes to Cambridge\r\nAnalytica on Dec 11, 2015 to ask when we will have demographic data available for their\r\nusage: \"could you give me an indication of when we we will have some demographic data. I\r\nwas under the impression that it would not be for a while, but I've been informed otherwise.”\r\nAfter our team liaising with Leave.EU back and forth, he confirms that some access has been\r\ngiven to campaign materials and/or data: “I've spoken to Andy in graphics. As far as he can\r\ntell, you have all the information/access you need. Please advise on where to go from here.\r\nBrittany and David, do you still plan to come next week?”\r\n\r\nf.\tEmail thread Leave4 from Ian Warren at Election Data, as a consultant to Leave.EU sharing\r\nelection data and insights with Cambridge Analytica as part of the Leave.EU team: \"Please\r\nfind attached the first of five reports on the Labour vote.

Facebook data issues\r\n\r\nI am not a data scientist, and I never handled Cambridge Analytica’s data models or any\r\nsignificant datasets myself. I have been shocked by the testimony to this committee on this topic\r\nand the growing number of reports about how Facebook data was abused by Alexander Kogan,\r\nGlobal Science Research and Cambridge Analytica without users’ consent, and even more\r\nshocked about Facebook’s own failures to protect their users’ data.\r\n\r\nI only heard through the media about the specifics of the Facebook research project undertaken\r\nin 2014 by Alexander Kogan, both through an initial Guardian article in December 2015 and\r\nthrough the most recent revelations. The research took place before I joined SCL, and I never\r\nmet Kogan. I can answer questions on this topic but have no special knowledge of the datasets\r\nor their acquisition.\r\n\r\nI can say that I was concerned about what I read in the media in 2015, and was assured by\r\ncompany executives in January that they had taken appropriate action to comply with the law\r\nand contractual requirements, including deleting all Facebook data. But it’s important also to\r\nemphasise that during most of my time at Cambridge Analytica, the culture and assumptions of\r\nthe firm and the wider data brokerage and ad tech industries within which it operated were a bit\r\n“Wild West”, with citizens’ data being scraped, resold and modelled willy-nilly. I have gained\r\nfurther understanding and perspective on these issues in recent weeks. I do believe I have\r\nevidence of CA obtaining, retaining and using these datasets, seemingly in contravention of legal\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nThis is why I launched the #OwnYourData campaign at the start of April, challenging Mark\r\nZuckerberg to alter Facebook’s terms of service to give users more rights over the use and\r\n\r\nmonetisation of their own data. The petition I started for the campaign on Change.org now has\r\n147,000 signatures. We have asked Zuckerberg to respond by 30th April. I would encourage the\r\nSelect Committee to ask Facebook’s CTO Mike Schroepfer about these issues, and am happy to\r\nprovide further briefing and a list of suggested questions.\r\n\r\nI want to address a few specific details about Facebook data issues:\r\n\r\na)\tAccess to Facebook data was a part of Cambridge Analytica’s sales and marketing\r\n“pitch” to commercial, political and defence clients throughout my time at the company -\r\neven after the request from Facebook to delete the data.\r\n\r\nb)\tI never had access to the Kogan/GSR dataset on 87 million friends, or to any other\r\nsophisticated Facebook dataset; I how it had been acquired, and I was told by company\r\nleadership that Cambridge Analytica was complying with the law and with Facebook’s\r\nrequirements at all times.\r\n\r\nc)\tIn May 2015, Cambridge Analytica’s current Chief Data Officer asked for me and two\r\nother colleagues to look through a list of Facebook groups and choose 500 of them to\r\nreceive data related to the people who had liked those groups. I was told this was oneof\r\nour last chances to get Facebook data. I believe now that this is later than the publicly\r\nstated date of April 2015 when the API loophole was announced to be closed.]\r\n\r\nd)\tAs I told The Guardian in March 2018, I was forwarded emails between CA’s Chief Data\r\nOfficer and Facebook in December 2015 and January 2016. Facebook asked if we still\r\npossessed the Kogan/GSR datasets; our CDO confirmed that we did; Facebook asked\r\nfor them - and any models derived from these datasets - to be destroyed. The CDO then\r\ntold Facebook that the data had been deleted. Following statements from former CA\r\nemployees, I am now asking questions about whether this was the case.\r\n\r\ne)\tI have since found another email dating from March 2016 in which another of our senior\r\ndata scientists confirmed in writing that we were using some Facebook likes for\r\nmodeling, two months after we confirmed that these data were deleted.\r\n\r\nf)\tI should emphasise that the Kogan/GSR datasets and questionnaires were not the only\r\nFacebook-connected questionnaires and datasets which Cambridge Analytica used. I am\r\naware in a general sense of a wide range of surveys which were done by CA or its\r\npartners, usually with a Facebook login - for example, the “sex compass” quiz. I do not\r\nknow the specifics of these surveys or how the data was acquired or processed. But I\r\nbelieve it is almost certain that the number of Facebook users whose data was\r\ncompromised through routes similar to that used by Kogan is much greater than 87\r\nmillion; and that both Cambridge Analytica and other unconnected companies and\r\ncampaigns were involved in these activities.\r\n\r\nDocuments include:\r\n\r\n1.\tEmail requests\r\n\r\n2.\tAttachment of group lists\r\n\r\n3.\tAttachment of chosen groups\r\n\r\n4.\tEmail correspondence in response to Facebook’s notice of the need to delete data\r\n\r\n5.\tEmail correspondence confirming we still use facebook likes for modeling\r\n\r\nNigeria campaign\r\n\r\nThere have been various reports regarding a short communications project undertaken in Nigeria in\r\n2015 in support of Goodluck Jonathan and in opposition to the candidacy of Muhamadu Bukhari. I\r\nwas involved in securing this contract for the SCL Group and liaising with the client in the beginning\r\nof the engagement, and in a specific part of the project with lawyers highlighting historic human\r\nrights abuses. I never visited Nigeria during this project. I am submitting the campaign portfolio of all\r\nmaterials produced and used in this Cambridge Analytica campaign in Nigeria.\r\n\r\nMy only other involvement was in response to a specific and persistent request from the client, for\r\nopposition research services which I understood Cambridge Analytica did not themselves provide. At\r\nthe client’s request, I made additional inquiries, identified a suitable research company which might\r\nbe able to deliver effective opposition research, and introduced the client to them. Contrary to some\r\nmedia reports, this company was not called Black Cube. There was then one meeting between\r\nCambridge Analytica staff and representatives of that company. I should emphasise that opposition\r\nresearch is a fairly standard part of political campaigns in most countries, and is often conducted by\r\npeople with backgrounds in government service.\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n\r\nNIS Campaign portfolio - images, videos and press articles in full\r\n\r\nBreitbart data\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the events around the Brexit campaign, I was recently reminded of the fact that the\r\nBreitbart media platform had a UK channel, “Breitbart London”, in which UKIP-linked figures played\r\nkey roles. One of Cambridge Analytica’s competitive advantages in the US marketplace in 2016, and\r\na key part of our pitch to Republican clients, was that we had secured exclusive rights to resell\r\nBreitbart engagement data. This meant that we had at least some access to what tens of millions of\r\nAmericans were reading on Breitbart, and could feed this data into our campaign models to help\r\npredict resonant issues - and to influence behaviour. Breitbart became one of the biggest media\r\nplatforms in the US in 2016, and its stories often went viral on Facebook.\r\n\r\nI am not aware of any such agreement or data sharing in relation to Breitbart London, but it would be\r\ninteresting to know if our US data tracking tags were in place on that UK channel, and whether any\r\ndata about what stories British people were reading on Breitbart or other websites ever made their\r\nway to Leave campaigns.\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n\r\nBreitbart data email\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWhen I decided to expose abuses of data and electoral law last month, I also decided I wanted to\r\nshare key pieces of information with parliamentarians and the authorities. I have returned to the UK\r\nspecifically to do this, of my own free will and at my own expense, to support the work of the Fake\r\nNews Inquiry and the Information Commissioner’s Office. I have a busy schedule in the coming\r\nweeks, but am more than willing to answer further specific questions in the future.\r\n\r\nGovernments, private companies and wealthy individuals have long had the opportunity to buy,\r\nlicense and collect our datasets. The past decade has seen a rampant rise of this data collection and\r\nmodelling, targeting individuals to sell products, services and political ideology. I know this all too\r\nwell, as a data rights campaigner and former employee of Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nPrivacy has become a myth, and tracking people’s behavior has become an essential part of using\r\nsocial media and the internet itself; tools that were meant to free our minds and make us more\r\nconnected, with faster access to information than ever before. Instead of connecting us, these tools\r\nhave divided us. It’s time to expose their abuses, so we can have an honest conversation about how\r\nwe build a better way forward.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the opportunity to have given this testimony to Parliament. These are little-known areas\r\nwhich people are only just beginning to understand. I believe that shining a light on historic abuses,\r\nwhether illegal or illegitimate, can help us forge a new social contract in which we use our wealth of\r\ndata for good, instead of exploitation.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I am calling through the #OwnYourData campaign for individual data to be protected as\r\nproperty, where we each have sensible permission structures, the right to make our data portable,\r\nand to monetize it for our own basic needs and freedoms.\r\n\r\nNo longer should the powerful be allowed to monopolise control over our data, the headlines, and\r\nthe power that these communications tools wield. Let us move forward together, for prosperity, truth,\r\nrights and freedom.\r\n\r\nApril 2018",

As we discussed, we will make sure that the Target Audience Analysis (TAA) suits the\r\npurposes of Leave as well as UKIP and we will try to seed some questions into the survey that will\r\nhelp inform future study of insurance risk profiling.\r\n\r\nOnce we have completed the TAA and matched it to the Experian data we will be in a position to\r\nstart microtargeting and, at that time, we would propose that we start digital outreach and a\r\nprogram of voter engagement and fundraising. However, following our discussion yesterday on the\r\nway you are using Facebook (and chatting it over with our Head of Digital Marketing afterwards), it\r\noccurred to me that you may like us to take over you current list-building activity in the\r\ninterim. From what you've said, I'm certain we could improve the effectiveness and yield from\r\ncurrent activities and that would give us a stronger base for the fundraising programme in the New\r\nYear.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think and whether or not we should include it in the topics for\r\ndiscussion with Arron on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nSeparately, I look forward to seeing you again soon when you're up in London, so do let us know\r\nwhen you are coming.\r\n\r\nBest wishes\r\nJulian\r\n\r\nJulian Wheatland\r\n\r\nGroup COO\r\n\r\nCA Cambridge Analytica\r\n\r\nThe News Corp.

As you will see the report includes detailed analysis of\r\ndemographic characteristics and political behaviour. There is an Executive Summary at the beginning if the full report is\r\ntoo long to consume.\r\n\r\nThis first report is one of five I will produce:\r\n\r\n1.\tBlue collar working households (attached)\r\n\r\n2.\tStruggling, financially strapped households\r\n\r\n3.\tYoung, metropolitan liberals\r\n\r\n4.\tCurrent students\r\n\r\n5.\tEthnic minorities\r\n\r\nEach of these groups have distinct demographic characteristics, personality traits and political behaviours. They will\r\nrequire subtely different messaging as a result. Julian and the team at Cambridge and I had a productive meeting in\r\nLondon before Christmas and I hope this report will start to flesh this out.\r\n\r\nLabour voters have relatively poor turnout levels as a rule. The traditional approach is to have a phased campaign, with\r\n'persuasion' messaging earlier in the campaign giving way to 'get out the vote' messaging later on. I anticipate this will be\r\nthe case with the Labour voters here. That said, there are some socially conservative Labour voters with fairly closed\r\npersonality traits which have either already made up their minds or view any messaging with suspicion if it doesn't chime\r\nwith their world view. With those voters the aim should be simply to 'keep the pot boiling' with issues like immigration\r\nrather than continually hammering them. For younger, liberal voters who are high-information, open and extroverted\r\npersonalities there is a place for persuasion messaging to be effective if it is dispassionate and objective.\r\n\r\nI will let you consume the report, and please ask any questions you have.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nIan Warren\r\nElection-Data\r\n\r\nFrom: Jordanna Zetter\r\n\r\nSubject: Re: Friday's Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica Meeting\r\nDate: January 6, 2016 at 16:24:59 GMT\r\n\r\nTo: arronb, liz bilney, Brittany Kaiser, julian wheatland, pere w brown, David Wilkinson, Executive\r\nAssistant to Arron Banks & Liz Bilney\r\n\r\nDear All,\r\n\r\nI hope you\r\n\r\nPlease find\r\nshared with\r\nhappy to di\r\n\r\nhave had\r\n\r\nattached\r\n\r\nLiz.

    "brochure_text": "Written testimony to the Fake News Inquiry\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser\r\n\r\nI want to thank the British Parliament for this opportunity to bear witness to the inquiry on Fake News. As a\r\nbeliever in truth, universal human rights and democracy, I understand that fake news undermines these ideals\r\nand threatens everything we hold dear, but it is just a symptom of a deeper problem. The elite have spent too\r\nmany years using technology to take advantage of the people’s openness and goodwill. I can no longer stand\r\nby while the privileged abuse their power, intentionally or unintentionally. I want to help shed light in dark\r\nplaces, and to help people be more responsible in their actions. This is why I spoke out originally, and this is\r\nwhy I have returned to the UK willingly and at my own expense to testify to this inquiry.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of background, I was born in Houston, Texas, and grew up in Chicago. I went to high school at\r\nPhillips Academy Andover outside of Boston, then moved to Edinburgh to study two of my lifelong passions:\r\ninternational relations and human rights. During my academic studies, I volunteered on the presidential\r\ncampaign of Howard Dean and the senatorial campaign of Barack Obama, before becoming part of the small\r\nnew media team on Obama’s presidential campaign in 2007/8.\r\n\r\nI then spent several years working on human rights projects around the world, including work for Amnesty\r\nInternational, lobbying at the United Nations and European Parliament to stop crimes against humanity, and\r\ncontributing to human rights research projects in Asia; while pursuing further postgraduate degrees in human\r\nrights law, diplomacy and development. I began to focus on how social change projects could become more\r\neffective, for example through data-driven early warning systems against genocide. I also worked on\r\ninternational trade and development, and worked around the world as a freelance political consultant.\r\n\r\nI first met Alexander Nix when I was working with Democrats Abroad in London. I think it was 2013. Friends\r\nof ours thought it would be a good joke to introduce us as he was consulting to the Republican Party. He was\r\nvery interested in learning more about my experience with the Democrats. He gave me his card and said, “Let\r\nme get you drunk and steal your secrets”. I didn’t call him.\r\n\r\nWe met coincidentally a few times after that; and in December 2014, he offered me a job. I wanted to find a\r\nway to be more effective in campaigning and positive social change, and his firm Strategic Communications\r\nLaboratories (SCL) boasted of scientifically valid methods of measuring effectiveness. I have always wanted\r\nus to use power for good, not ill. The first project I worked on with SCL was on driving engagement for\r\nreconstruction of ebola-stricken countries.\r\n\r\nI began at SCL Group as a part-time consultant with the title of special adviser. I became full-time in February\r\n2015, and left in January 2018. My job title was left to me. My focus was on sales and business development, a\r\nfield in which titles are often inflated. I called myself Director of Program Development initially; this then\r\nchanged to Director of Business Development.\r\n\r\nAt no time was I part of the executive leadership or top management team of SCL or Cambridge Analytica -\r\nalthough I wanted to be, and I believe I contributed hugely to the success of the company. I was never an\r\nofficer of the board of any of the companies. I was also not a data scientist or someone with access to\r\ncontroversial datasets. Since I left, I have been learning just how many secrets the management team were\r\nkeeping me out of, and looking back with fresh eyes on emails I was copied in to and other documents.\r\n\r\nMy job at Cambridge Analytica was primarily to meet potential clients, hear what they wanted and required,\r\nand brief the operations team in order to produce a sales proposal, often under the guidance of senior managers\r\nand executives like CEO Alexander Nix, CFO/COO Julian Wheatland, and Chief Data Officer Alex Tayler. I\r\nhad access to company materials on products and services, account management, and to potential and current\r\nclients.\r\n\r\nMy testimony here is informed by what I witnessed and experienced during my time at Cambridge Analytica\r\nand SCL, and materials I worked on or was copied in to. When I originally spoke to The Guardian in March\r\n2018, I provided relevant materials from my Cambridge Analytica inbox. I was locked out of my files, but later\r\nfound an offline copy of my SCL inbox with further materials.\r\n\r\nI would now like to submit the following specific testimony and supporting packages of evidence:\r\n\r\nBrexit, UKIP & Eldon Insurance\r\n\r\nCambridge Analytica was initially engaged with Arron Banks, Andy Wigmore and Matthew Richardson to\r\ndesign parallel proposals for Leave.EU, GoSkippy/Eldon Insurance and the UK Independence Party. I was\r\nasked by Nix and Wheatland to take the lead on contract negotiations. I believe this is because, as upper class\r\nBrits, they did not want to front up the deal with him themselves. Banks was excited to discover my\r\nbackground with the Obama campaign.\r\n\r\nOver a period of five months, we undertook both meetings and work at the Bristol headquarters of Eldon\r\nInsurance, the SCL Group offices in Mayfair, and the Leave.EU London offices in Millbank Tower, as well as\r\na press launch and media engagements. Our work for UKIP/Leave.EU was never reported to the Electoral\r\nCommission by the party, the campaign, or our company.\r\n\r\nAt the time, I didn’t see anything wrong in what was being proposed. I am not a data lawyer or an expert in\r\nUK elections law; and we included caveats in our proposals about requiring legal advice before proceeding\r\nwith some elements of the project. Arron Banks said, “It’s my data” - it seemed natural that he would use it\r\nacross his initiatives. I was also reassured by a legal opinion arranged by former UKIP party secretary\r\nMatthew Richardson from Philip Coppel QC to UKIP and Cambridge Analytica, an opinion which Richardson\r\nco-signed in a manner which seems somewhat unorthodox in retrospect. I am providing this document now to\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, I now think that there is reason to believe that misuse of data was rife amongst the businesses and\r\ncampaigns of Arron Banks. If the personal data of UK citizens who just wanted to buy car insurance was used\r\nby GoSkippy and Eldon Insurance for political purposes, as may have been the case, people clearly did not opt\r\nin for their data to be used in this way by Leave.EU. I have similar concerns about whether UKIP members\r\nconsented to the use of their data.\r\n\r\nFor example, I went to Bristol with a senior data scientist to spend the day with the Leave.Eu team. We started\r\nthe work day by presenting to the heads of every department (social media, call center, IT/data, creative,\r\nevents) to show them how Cambridge Analytica uses data and would be supporting the Leave.Eu campaign.\r\nAfter the general presentation we went to work with each department to assess which kinds of data they had,\r\n\r\nhow they were being used and what kinds of capacity the team possessed. When we were with the call center\r\nteam, we enquired on the databases being used for the calls, which I was told were from the insurance\r\ncompany. It seemed to me that the datasets and the staff were being used for Eldon/GoSkippy Insurance as\r\nwell as Leave.eu in parallel.\r\n\r\nArron Banks refused to pay our phase 1 bill of £41,500 for work undertaken, despite what I was told by Julian\r\nWheatland was a firm commitment by Leave.EU chief executive and Banks associate Liz Bilney to do so. I\r\nhave no memory of seeing or hearing about the invoice later sent to UKIP for this work, which has recently\r\nbeen revealed in the media. I understand that Banks made a donation of £42,000 to UKIP a week before the\r\nreferendum vote, perhaps to tidy things up. But I had and have no evidence around this; and I understand that\r\nno payment was ever made to Cambridge Analytica by UKIP. To the best of my knowledge, our work with\r\nUKIP and Leave.EU never made it into any report to the Electoral Commission.\r\n\r\nFinally, I was recently made aware of a data company set up by Arron Banks called “Big Data Dolphins”, soon\r\nafter he ceased negotiations with Cambridge Analytica and declined to pay our phase 1 bill.\r\n\r\nThis company has reportedly worked with a data science team at the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss). If\r\nthe Mississippi team has held or processed UK citizens’ data in the US, I believe that is likely to be a criminal\r\noffence; although it is for the empowered authorities to pursue any such question and secure the associated\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIn retrospect, based on what I now know, I believe that Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore have serious\r\nquestions to answer. They should perhaps themselves be summoned to testify before Parliament. I do not\r\nbelieve Banks’s written evidence to this inquiry is a full account of what happened. I also hope that evidence\r\ncan be preserved.\r\n\r\nI am submitting the following supporting materials on Brexit to the inquiry:\r\n\r\n1. GoSkippy Proposal and supporting emails\r\n\r\na.\tGoSkippy original proposal document\r\n\r\nb.\tGoSkippy1 email thread regarding scheduling a follow up meeting at Leave.EU offices in\r\nBristol, where I write on January 8, 2016: \"I recall before the holidays we spoke about Aaron\r\nbeing available in Bristol next week on Wednesday and Thursday the 13/14. Are these dates\r\nstill a possibility? My team does not mind coming down to Bristol as we have pending\r\nmeetings with other members of the Leave.EU teams as well as GoSkippy departments.\"\r\n\r\n2. Phase 1 & 2 Leave.EU Proposal and supporting emails\r\n\r\na.\tSee Leave.EU original proposal outlining Phase 1 & Phase 2 work streams\r\n\r\nb.\tSee Leave.EU follow up proposal, following a request from Banks to combine/correlate work\r\nstreams with Eldon Insurance and UKIP\r\n\r\nc.\tEmail Leavel dated Dec 5, 2015, from Julian Wheatland to Liz Bilney, confirming Arron\r\nBanks and Leave.EU’s intent to have Cambridge Analytica create a joint data program for\r\nLeave.EU, UKIP and the insurance company, as well as to initiate a fundraising program:\r\n\r\n”Thanks for coming into see us yesterday - it was a pleasure to meet you and it sounds like\r\nwe are on the right track. As we discussed, we will make sure that the Target Audience\r\n\r\nAnalysis (TAA) suits the purposes of Leave as well as UKIP and we will try to seed some\r\nquestions into the survey that will help inform future study of insurance risk profiling. Once\r\nwe have completed the TAA and matched it to the Experian data we will be in a position to\r\nstart microtargeting and, at that time, we would propose that we start digital outreach and a\r\nprogram of voter engagement and fundraising. However, following our discussion yesterday\r\non the way you are using Facebook (and chatting it over with our Head of Digital Marketing\r\nafterwards), it occurred to me that you may like us to take over you current list-building\r\nactivity in the interim. From what you’ve said, I’m certain we could improve the effectiveness\r\nand yield from current activities and that would give us a stronger base for the fundraising\r\nprogramme in the New Year.”\r\n\r\nd.\tEmail Leave2, I write to confirm with Julian Wheatland that our budget is approved by\r\nLeave.EU as follows: \"In your last full chats with Liz, she said the budget was approved and\r\nwe were awaiting approval for the payment schedule, etc, is that correct? Anyhow, would you\r\nlike me to contact Frances, whom I've been liaising with on Aaron's schedule, to get\r\nsomething in the calendar for the week of January 4th?” His response is \"Yes that’s correct\r\nand yes please.\"\r\n\r\ne.\tEmail thread Leave3, Pierre Shepard, Leave.EU Head of Research, writes to Cambridge\r\nAnalytica on Dec 11, 2015 to ask when we will have demographic data available for their\r\nusage: \"could you give me an indication of when we we will have some demographic data. I\r\nwas under the impression that it would not be for a while, but I've been informed otherwise.”\r\nAfter our team liaising with Leave.EU back and forth, he confirms that some access has been\r\ngiven to campaign materials and/or data: “I've spoken to Andy in graphics. As far as he can\r\ntell, you have all the information/access you need. Please advise on where to go from here.\r\nBrittany and David, do you still plan to come next week?”\r\n\r\nf.\tEmail thread Leave4 from Ian Warren at Election Data, as a consultant to Leave.EU sharing\r\nelection data and insights with Cambridge Analytica as part of the Leave.EU team: \"Please\r\nfind attached the first offive reports on the Labour vote. As you will see the report includes\r\ndetailed analysis of demographic characteristics and political behaviour.

Facebook data issues\r\n\r\nI am not a data scientist, and I never handled Cambridge Analytica’s data models or any\r\nsignificant datasets myself. I have been shocked by the testimony to this committee on this topic\r\nand the growing number of reports about how Facebook data was abused by Alexander Kogan,\r\nGlobal Science Research and Cambridge Analytica without users’ consent, and even more\r\nshocked about Facebook’s own failures to protect their users’ data.\r\n\r\nI only heard through the media about the specifics of the Facebook research project undertaken\r\nin 2014 by Alexander Kogan, both through an initial Guardian article in December 2015 and\r\nthrough the most recent revelations. The research took place before I joined SCL, and I never\r\nmet Kogan. I can answer questions on this topic but have no special knowledge of the datasets\r\nor their acquisition.\r\n\r\nI can say that I was concerned about what I read in the media in 2015, and was assured by\r\ncompany executives in January that they had taken appropriate action to comply with the law\r\nand contractual requirements, including deleting all Facebook data. But it’s important also to\r\nemphasise that during most of my time at Cambridge Analytica, the culture and assumptions of\r\nthe firm and the wider data brokerage and ad tech industries within which it operated were a bit\r\n“Wild West”, with citizens’ data being scraped, resold and modelled willy-nilly. I have gained\r\nfurther understanding and perspective on these issues in recent weeks. I do believe I have\r\nevidence of CA obtaining, retaining and using these datasets, seemingly in contravention of legal\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nThis is why I launched the #OwnYourData campaign at the start of April, challenging Mark\r\nZuckerberg to alter Facebook’s terms of service to give users more rights over the use and\r\nmonetisation of their own data. The petition I started for the campaign on Change.org now has\r\n147,000 signatures. We have asked Zuckerberg to respond by 30th April. I would encourage the\r\nSelect Committee to ask Facebook’s CTO Mike Schroepfer about these issues, and am happy to\r\nprovide further briefing and a list of suggested questions.\r\n\r\nI want to address a few specific details about Facebook data issues:\r\n\r\na)\tAccess to Facebook data was a part of Cambridge Analytica’s sales and marketing\r\n“pitch” to commercial, political and defence clients throughout my time at the company -\r\neven after the request from Facebook to delete the data.\r\n\r\nb)\tI never had access to the Kogan/GSR dataset on 87 million friends, or to any other\r\nsophisticated Facebook dataset; I how it had been acquired, and I was told by company\r\nleadership that Cambridge Analytica was complying with the law and with Facebook’s\r\nrequirements at all times.\r\n\r\nc)\tIn May 2015, Cambridge Analytica’s current Chief Data Officer asked for me and two\r\nother colleagues to look through a list of Facebook groups and choose 500 of them to\r\nreceive data related to the people who had liked those groups. I was told this was oneof\r\nour last chances to get Facebook data. I believe now that this is later than the publicly\r\nstated date of April 2015 when the API loophole was announced to be closed.]\r\n\r\nd)\tAs I told The Guardian in March 2018, I was forwarded emails between CA’s Chief Data\r\nOfficer and Facebook in December 2015 and January 2016. Facebook asked if we still\r\npossessed the Kogan/GSR datasets; our CDO confirmed that we did; Facebook asked\r\nfor them - and any models derived from these datasets - to be destroyed. The CDO then\r\ntold Facebook that the data had been deleted. Following statements from former CA\r\nemployees, I am now asking questions about whether this was the case.\r\n\r\ne)\tI have since found another email dating from March 2016 in which another of our senior\r\ndata scientists confirmed in writing that we were using some Facebook likes for\r\nmodeling, two months after we confirmed that these data were deleted.\r\n\r\nf)\tI should emphasise that the Kogan/GSR datasets and questionnaires were not the only\r\nFacebook-connected questionnaires and datasets which Cambridge Analytica used. I am\r\naware in a general sense of a wide range of surveys which were done by CA or its\r\npartners, usually with a Facebook login - for example, the “sex compass” quiz. I do not\r\nknow the specifics of these surveys or how the data was acquired or processed. But I\r\nbelieve it is almost certain that the number of Facebook users whose data was\r\ncompromised through routes similar to that used by Kogan is much greater than 87\r\nmillion; and that both Cambridge Analytica and other unconnected companies and\r\ncampaigns were involved in these activities.\r\n\r\nDocuments include:\r\n\r\n1.\tEmail requests\r\n\r\n2.\tAttachment of group lists\r\n\r\n3.\tAttachment of chosen groups\r\n\r\n4.\tEmail correspondence in response to Facebook’s notice of the need to delete data\r\n\r\n5.\tEmail correspondence confirming we still use facebook likes for modeling\r\n\r\nNigeria campaign\r\n\r\nThere have been various reports regarding a short communications project undertaken in Nigeria in\r\n2015 in support of Goodluck Jonathan and in opposition to the candidacy of Muhamadu Bukhari. I\r\nwas involved in securing this contract for the SCL Group and liaising with the client in the beginning\r\nof the engagement, and in a specific part of the project with lawyers highlighting historic human\r\nrights abuses. I never visited Nigeria during this project. I am submitting the campaign portfolio of all\r\nmaterials produced and used in this Cambridge Analytica campaign in Nigeria.\r\n\r\nMy only other involvement was in response to a specific and persistent request from the client, for\r\nopposition research services which I understood Cambridge Analytica did not themselves provide. At\r\nthe client’s request, I made additional inquiries, identified a suitable research company which might\r\nbe able to deliver effective opposition research, and introduced the client to them. Contrary to some\r\nmedia reports, this company was not called Black Cube. There was then one meeting between\r\nCambridge Analytica staff and representatives of that company. I should emphasise that opposition\r\nresearch is a fairly standard part of political campaigns in most countries, and is often conducted by\r\npeople with backgrounds in government service.\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n\r\nNIS Campaign portfolio - images, videos and press articles in full\r\n\r\nBreitbart data\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the events around the Brexit campaign, I was recently reminded of the fact that the\r\nBreitbart media platform had a UK channel, “Breitbart London”, in which UKIP-linked figures played\r\nkey roles. One of Cambridge Analytica’s competitive advantages in the US marketplace in 2016, and\r\na key part of our pitch to Republican clients, was that we had secured exclusive rights to resell\r\nBreitbart engagement data. This meant that we had at least some access to what tens of millions of\r\nAmericans were reading on Breitbart, and could feed this data into our campaign models to help\r\npredict resonant issues - and to influence behaviour. Breitbart became one of the biggest media\r\nplatforms in the US in 2016, and its stories often went viral on Facebook.\r\n\r\nI am not aware of any such agreement or data sharing in relation to Breitbart London, but it would be\r\ninteresting to know if our US data tracking tags were in place on that UK channel, and whether any\r\ndata about what stories British people were reading on Breitbart or other websites ever made their\r\nway to Leave campaigns.\r\n\r\nDocumentation:\r\n\r\nBreitbart data email\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nWhen I decided to expose abuses of data and electoral law last month, I also decided I wanted to\r\nshare key pieces of information with parliamentarians and the authorities. I have returned to the UK\r\nspecifically to do this, of my own free will and at my own expense, to support the work of the Fake\r\nNews Inquiry and the Information Commissioner’s Office. I have a busy schedule in the coming\r\nweeks, but am more than willing to answer further specific questions in the future.\r\n\r\nGovernments, private companies and wealthy individuals have long had the opportunity to buy,\r\nlicense and collect our datasets. The past decade has seen a rampant rise of this data collection and\r\nmodelling, targeting individuals to sell products, services and political ideology. I know this all too\r\nwell, as a data rights campaigner and former employee of Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nPrivacy has become a myth, and tracking people’s behavior has become an essential part of using\r\nsocial media and the internet itself; tools that were meant to free our minds and make us more\r\nconnected, with faster access to information than ever before. Instead of connecting us, these tools\r\nhave divided us. It’s time to expose their abuses, so we can have an honest conversation about how\r\nwe build a better way forward.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the opportunity to have given this testimony to Parliament. These are little-known areas\r\nwhich people are only just beginning to understand. I believe that shining a light on historic abuses,\r\nwhether illegal or illegitimate, can help us forge a new social contract in which we use our wealth of\r\ndata for good, instead of exploitation.\r\n\r\nThat’s why I am calling through the #OwnYourData campaign for individual data to be protected as\r\nproperty, where we each have sensible permission structures, the right to make our data portable,\r\nand to monetize it for our own basic needs and freedoms.\r\n\r\nNo longer should the powerful be allowed to monopolise control over our data, the headlines, and\r\nthe power that these communications tools wield. Let us move forward together, for prosperity, truth,\r\nrights and freedom.",

Significant work has already been completed, and\r\nthis should take no longer than ten days including sign-off from Leave.EU and its partners on the content\r\nof the political questionnaire.\r\n\r\nDuring Phase II, CA will conduct two simultaneous large-scale online surveys of eligible voters across the\r\nUK's European regions. Each survey will collect responses from approximately 40,000 individuals, with the\r\nfirst survey focusing on gathering psychological insights into voters' personalities and decision-making.\r\nThe second survey will focus on gathering information useful in Target Audience Analysis (TAA), which\r\nmeasures political opinions, sociological structures and additional psychological metrics.\r\n\r\nPhase III will begin at the same time as Phase II, with CA's database engineers taking receipt of a large\r\ncommercial dataset containing hundreds of data points on individuals and formatting this for analysis\r\nand modeling. Once this formatting is complete, and the online surveys have produced a body of primary\r\ndata sufficiently large to provide insights, CA's data scientists will identify salient segments of the voting\r\npopulation (Target Audiences) according to their geographic location, views on the EU, propensity to\r\nvote and other factors. Voters across the previously acquired national dataset will then be assigned scores\r\nthat associate them with particular segments, enabling the identification of high-value targets likely to be\r\nsupportive of the campaign. Licenses to contact individuals via a variety of media can then be purchased\r\nseparately from CA's data vendor(s), with the size of this purchase to be determined based on available\r\nfinancial and other resources as well as overall strategy.\r\n\r\nWhilst Phase III is ongoing, CA's creative and software teams will be preparing the other elements of the\r\nproject. Our creative team will work with Leave.EU's campaign partners (advertisers, political marketing\r\nstrategists, etc) to develop a holistic creative communications strategy that fits with the campaign's overall\r\nobjectives and strategy.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, CA's software development team will adapt Connect for use by Leave.EU in the UK.\r\nConnect is an online database tool that allows campaigns to query their supporter lists, identify targets\r\nfor communications based on a range of criteria, and view market segments via a series of dynamic maps\r\nand data visualisation tools. CA will then provide a short training programme to Leave.EU staff on how to\r\nuse Connect, as well as how to use the psychographic and political insights contained in the database to\r\nincrease the power of its interactions with voters.\r\n\r\nLeave.EU will be able to ensure that every piece of digital or print advertising sent out is directed at\r\nsomebody who cares about the particular issue and is likely to respond positively. This means that your\r\ncampaign can save money that would otherwise have been spent contacting voters who are vehemently\r\npro-EU, and direct those resources into making more frequent contact with swing voters and supporters\r\nyou wish to mobilise as donors or volunteers.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\nANALYTICA\r\n\r\nPROPOSED TIMELINE\r\n\r\nThe approach outlined on the previous page will take

Their underlying personality will shape\r\nhow they view the world and how they respond to communications.\r\n\r\nGoSkippy's data represents a wealth of insight into what motivates and drives customers, however up until\r\nnow this has not been utilised in the most efficient way.\r\n\r\nSCL can help harness the value of this data: we identify which people you should be targeting and tell you the\r\nmost effective way to engage them.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding your customer base is vital. Working together, we can turn this data into insights that guide\r\nyour engagement campaigns by synthesising your understanding of the insurance industry with our analytics\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThis preliminary research project will allow us to discover exactly what drives your current customer base and\r\nwill help us to begin investigating the innate qualities and differences that define your wider target audience.\r\nBy doing this we will be able to put together a comprehensive data-driven strategy that will help to improve\r\nthe way GoSkippy engages both old and new customers.\r\n\r\nPROPOSAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSCL proposes to undertake a short program that begins the process of understanding GoSkippy's data in\r\norder to offer you data driven insights that allow you to better understand the insurance industry's customer\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nThis research program consists of 5 main stages starting with data cleaning and analysis and culminating with\r\na proposal outlining exactly how we can use your data to target and retarget customers in exactly the right\r\nway:\r\n\r\n1.\tVerify Clean and Integrate data\r\n\r\nUsing the data held by GoSkippy, SCL's team of data scientists will clean, analyze and explore the data to\r\nidentify how it can be worked with in the future. To provide examples of the format this will take we will begin\r\npreliminary analysis to outline the different customer clusters that GoSkippy mostly engage with.\r\n\r\n2.\tInvestigate and Assess the Value of Appending Commercially Available Data\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the further work we will be proposing we will explore the benefit of appending\r\ncommercially available data to the pre-existing records and evaluate the real value that this could offer your\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n3.\tInvestigate the Legal Obligations of Commercial Data Matching to Individual Profiles\r\n\r\nData protection laws in the UK are very complex and if not completely understood can present problems\r\nfurther down the line. As an ICO registered company SCL is registered to abide by these laws and will\r\ntherefore use this time to gain a comprehensive understanding of the work we will be proposing to complete.\r\nThis will ensure that all products and services proposed are within ICO remits and will therefore prevent any\r\nfurther legal delays.\r\n\r\n4.\tProposal and Presentation\r\n\r\nHaving completed the work listed above we will create a detailed proposal that explains how our\r\nmethodology and findings can be used to target our identified GoSkippy audiences in ways that specifically\r\nappeal to them.\r\n\r\nAppendix\r\n\r\nRequirements from GoSkippy\r\n\r\n•\tMeetings with GoSkippy's Fraud and Claims and Underwriting departments to\r\nunderstand how they currently use data and what data they actually posess.\r\n\r\n•\tAccess to pre-existing GoSkippy data.\r\n\r\nKey Deliverable:\r\n\r\nA proposal detailing how SCL can work with GoSkippy to provide an insights\r\nthat will help understand your current customers and entice new ones too.

And it is increasingly\r\nthe case that voters don't easily fit into the traditional\r\nboxes of party supporters, especially when it comes\r\nto issues-based referenda.\r\n\r\nCambridge Analytica's Behavioral MicrotargetingTM\r\ngoes beyond demographics, enabling your\r\ncampaign to identify potential supporters\r\nirrespective of where they live or any demographic\r\ntraits that may have led political parties to overlook\r\nthem in the past.\r\n\r\nWe use vast amounts of data, including consumer\r\nhistories, lifestyle information, census returns, and\r\nhistorical voting records to construct advanced\r\nprofiles of individual voters.\r\n\r\nWe use state-of-the-art psychogical analysis to\r\nquantify voter behavior and design campaign\r\nmessaging strategies accordingly, and our voter\r\nprofiles include detailed insight into how likely\r\nvoters are to turn out, how persuadable they are,\r\nand the issues that are most important to them.\r\n\r\nThese profiles provide campaigns with a complete\r\nportrait of target groups, allowing you to better\r\nunderstand your traditional supporters as well as\r\nhow to identify and engage new enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nOur political messaging specialists help your\r\ncampaign design messages that speak directly\r\nto your target voters' unique profiles, helping you\r\nto forge a connection with supporters that will\r\nproduce real electoral results.\r\n\r\nBehavioral Microtargeting™ represents the next\r\ngeneration of voter messaging and mobilisation.\r\n\r\nBEHAVIORAL MICROTARGETING™ &\r\nPREDICTIVE ANALYTICS:\r\n\r\n;\r\n\r\no\r\n\r\nBEHAVIORAL\r\nMICROTARGETING ™\r\n\r\nTRADITIONAL\r\n\r\nMICROTARGETING\r\n\r\nDEMOGRAPHIC\r\n\r\nPOLLING\r\n\r\nPredictive models that\r\nreveal the underlying\r\npsychological triggers\r\nof behavior\r\n\r\nPredictive models\r\nthat segment voters\r\nby demographic\r\ndimensions\r\n\r\nStatic data that\r\nshows the general\r\nopinions of broad groups\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\nANALYTICA\r\n\r\nWHAT MICROTARGETING WILL DO FOR YOU\r\n\r\nVoters and businesses alike see the coming referndum as an opportunity to voice their concerns over\r\nissues caused by Britain's membership of the EU. Whether it is regulations, border controls or Britain's\r\ninternational profile, British people have real worries about the EU's impact on their lives and businesses.\r\nAs such, the coming months will be an important period for the Leave.EU campaign as it seeks to show\r\nthe public that it represents a serious position on the EU that is separate from the vested interests of\r\nfrequenty out-of-touch politicians.\r\n\r\nTo do this, Leave.EU must identify the types of people likely to support a 'Leave' campaign, whether they\r\nare journalists, businesspeople, politicians or ordinary voters, and capture their attention.\r\n\r\nCambridge Analytica can help you do this.\r\n\r\nFrom turnout propensity to issue salience to communications channel selection, we can provide\r\nLeave.Eu with a holistic campaign design that will maximise your chances of being successfully selected\r\nby the Electoral Commission and then give the 'Leave' campaign the best possible chance of winning the\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\nOur powerful predictive analytics and campaign messaging capacity can help you to segment and\r\nmessage the population according to a range of criteria:\r\n\r\nTURNOUT\r\n\r\nGroups based on likelihood to turn out to vote in\r\nparticular elections\r\n\r\nPRIORITY ISSUES\r\n\r\nGroups based on voter's priority top-line issues\r\n(eg.

Only once that has been accomplished can\r\nfocus shift to enlarging the scope of the the supporter engagement campaign in order to ensure that the\r\ncampaign's ultimate goal is achieved and that the United Kingdom leaves the European Union.\r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on the steps necessary to achieve Electoral Commission selection, and does not\r\ndeal with workstreams during the general campaign despite the fact that Cambridge Analytica would be\r\ndelighted to continue supporting this effort. We believe, however, that in the short term it is important to\r\nfocus on the task at hand.\r\n\r\nAs such, Cambridge Analytica has designed a two-phase programme of work that will engage key\r\nstakeholders and demonstrate the innovative and powerful nature of Leave.EU's campaign in advance\r\nof the Electoral Commission's decision.\r\n\r\nPhase I, which involves a short programme of data analytics and creative support, is specifically designed\r\nto enable Leave.EU to showcase its intellectual capacity and robust, data-driven approach to campaigning\r\nduring the series of presentations scheduled for November 17th and 18th. The products of Phase I will be\r\na comprehensive plan for further research and data analytics on a larger scale, as well as sample creative\r\nproducts across multiple formats (digital, print, audiovisual) that will begin to illustrate to observers\r\nthat Leave.EU has the capacity to execute a powerful, exciting and technologically advanced national\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the initial phase, Phase II will involve a pilot microtargeting project in one geographic area,\r\nwhich will provide Leave.EU with a deeper understanding of the dynamics at work across the UK in terms\r\nof views on Europe and voting intentions. Additionally, this pilot project will provide further evidence of\r\nLeave.EU's capacity to successfully mobilise supporters and convince swing voters, further underlining to\r\nthe Electoral Commission and others that Leave.EU is the premier 'Leave' campaign.\r\n\r\nThe products of Phase II will be a comprehensive report on target audiences identified, as well as an online\r\nvoter engagement platform that will allow Leave.EU to target specific voters based on their interests and\r\nvoting intentions.\r\n\r\nIn parrallel with Phase II, we will coordinate a programme of targetted donation solicitation, using digital\r\nadvertising and other media as appropriate to raise funds for Leave.EU in the UK, USA and in other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\nANALYTICA\r\n\r\nPHASE I: DATA MATCHING, ANALYTICS & STRATEGY\r\n\r\nLeave.EU's main priority during the initial stages of this campaign should be convincing journalists, donors,\r\npoliticians and the Electoral Commission that they are the 'Leave' campaign that best represents those\r\nwho wish to restore Britain's independence from the EU.\r\n\r\nWith that objective in mind, Cambridge Analytica proposes a short programme of data integration\r\nand analytics that will enable the campaign to better understand its existing supporters and to begin\r\ndesigning its messaging strategy.\r\n\r\nWorking with the data that Leave.EU and its allies have already collected from supporters, we can analyse\r\nvoters' viewpoints and provide summarised insights that will help you to understand their motivations and\r\ninterests. These insights will then form the basis for the development of a series of sample creative pieces,\r\nincluding static and audiovisual digital advertising and mail products, which will be designed to appeal to\r\nspecific segments of Leave.EU's support.\r\n\r\nFinally, we will collaborate with Leave.EU and its partners to develop a presentation that can be delivered\r\nto stakeholders on the 17th and 18th of November. This presentation will show viewers the depth of talent\r\nsupporting Leave.EU, as well as the innovative data analytics and creative development that the campaign\r\nwill be deploying.\r\n\r\nVOTER GROUP ANALYTICS REPORTS FOR STRATEGY PRESENTATION\r\n\r\nAnalysis of voter universe:\r\n\r\n•\tBriefing packs on predetermined supporter segments\r\n\r\n•\tHigh-level message creation\r\n\r\n•\tDesign of research methodology and strategy for Phase II\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE\r\nV/\\ ANALYTICA\r\n\r\nPHASE I: ESTIMATED TIMEFRAME & BUDGET\r\n\r\nThe deadline for Phase I of this project is Monday November 16th,\r\nwith presentations November 17 & 18.\r\n\r\nKey Cambridge Analytica critical path tasks:\r\n\r\n•\tReceive and integrate house file data; identify suitable supporter target audiences\r\n\r\n•\tDevelop digital marketing materials and messaging content for the showcases on November 17 and\r\n18th, inclusive of creative guidelines and sample materials production\r\n\r\nRequirements from the Leave.EU campaign:\r\n\r\n•\tHouse file of supporters, members, and subscribers - delivery scheduled for Tuesday Nov 3rd\r\n\r\n•\tAccess to digital outreach resources, including Facebook page and other social media accounts\r\n\r\n•\tBranding creative: logo, graphic elements, color palette, images, taglines and phrases\r\n\r\n•\tPriority campaign issues\r\n\r\n•\tCo-ordination process to integrate the campaign's contacts and online presence for digital outreach\r\n(e.g. web user flow, landing pages, sign-up process) and mail vendors\r\n\r\nAdditional reporting deliverables:\r\n\r\n•\tTwo presentations/briefing sessions on results and analysis of findings\r\n\r\n•\tForward strategy documents to be produced for use in stakeholder meetings\r\n\r\nPROPOSED TIMELINE\r\n\r\nDATA CODING & INTEGRATION\r\nDATA ANALYTCS\r\nCREATIVE BRIEFING PACK PRODUCTION\r\nPRESENTATION PRODUCTION\r\nPRESENTATION TO STAKEHOLDERS\r\n\r\nWEEK\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n►\r\n\r\nESTIMATED BUDGET\r\n\r\nPHASE I\t\t\t\t\t\r\n1 Data Integration & Creative Production\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\tProject Manager\t£1,200.00\t1\t5\t£6,000.00\r\n\tSenior Data Scientist\t£1,500.00\t1\t9\t£13,500.00\r\n\tJunior Data Scientist\t£1,000.00\t2\t5\t£10,000.00\r\n\tData Engineer (Integration of house file with secondary data sources)\t£1,000.00\t1\t2\t£2,000.00\r\n\tPolitical Messaging Specialist\t£1,000.00\t1\t1\t£1,000.00\r\n\tCreative Director\t£1,500.00\t1\t1\t£1,500.00\r\n\tGraphic Designer\t£500.00\t2\t3\t£3,000.00\r\n\tSenior Responsible Director (Presentation)\t£1,500.00\t1\t3\t£4,500.00\r\n\tTotal\t\t\t\t£41,500.00\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE\r\nV/\\ ANALYTICA\r\n\r\nPHASE II: TAA & MICROTARGETING PILOT\r\n\r\nIn order to build on the work undertaken in Phase I, we propose a multi-faceted approach to Phase II.\r\n\r\nThe first part of this phase, which will be centred on a particular geographic area (likely a parliamentary\r\nconstituency), will involve a programme of Target Audience Analysis, whereby qualitative and\r\nquantitative research is conducted in order to segment the population into target audiences according to\r\ntheir views, motivations and interests.\r\n\r\nThe second part of Phase II, Political Microtargeting, involves the use of secondary data sources and\r\nadvanced analytics to assign values on particular traits to the entire voting population of the area in\r\nquestion. This will allow for the target audiences to be resegmented and contacted as required over\r\nthe course of the campaign, and the use of this data will be facilitated by the deployment of an online\r\ndatabase utility created by Cambridge Analytica for Leave.EU.\r\n\r\nTARGET AUDIENCE ANALYSIS (TAA)\r\n\r\nTarget Audience Analysis (TAA) is one component of Cambridge Analytica's unique methodology, and\r\nenables a comprehensive understanding of the opinions and motivations of key audience groups. More\r\nspecifically, it offers a unique insight into the public's perception of key political issues and underlying\r\nmotivations for voting behaviour including sociological and psychological factors.\r\n\r\nTAA begins with the collection of qualitative data through interviews and focus groups, which allow us\r\nto identify key issues and political attitudes that will be tested during the subsequent quantitative phase.\r\nCambridge Analytica's quantitative research methodology involves a large-scale survey, conducted online\r\nand/or via canvassing and telephone, which gathers large volumes of data on key issues and political\r\nopinions, as well as underlying motivations for behaviour such as propensity for change, normative\r\nsociological affiliation and other factors.\r\n\r\nThis data is then analysed by our in-house team of data scientists and statisticians to define Target\r\nAudience Profiles, which are descriptions of population segments that can be grouped together based on\r\ntheir shared characteristics. To do this, our scientists feed quantitative and qualitative data through a series\r\nof sociological, political and psychological parameters, identifying trends and grouping the population\r\naccordingly. In most cases this results in the definition of 4-6 Target Audience Profiles, though the number\r\nis entirely dependent on the population and issues being studied.\r\n\r\nEach of these profiles will outline the views and motivating factors driving behaviour amongst group\r\nmembers, and will also outline the messaging strategies most likely to be effective in influencing them to\r\nsupport the Leave.EU campaign.\r\n\r\nThe end result of this process is a comprehensive plan for influencing voters likely to be receptive to\r\nLeave.EU's positions and messages. This plan will include guidance on messaging including slogans\r\nand visuals, appropriate channels (digital, mail, etc.) and scheduling, which together constitute a holistic\r\nstrategy that will give Leave.EU the best chance of success.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE\r\nV/\\ ANALYTICA\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL MICROTARGETING\r\n\r\nBuilding on the insight contained in Target Audience Profiles, Cambridge Analytica's Political\r\nMicrotargeting methodology assigns values relating these profiles to individuals. While particular data\r\nprotection regulations and the availability of secondary data sources will dictate the extent to which this\r\nis possible (and as such this Phase has not yet been costed), Political Microtargeting is a process whereby\r\nindividuals across a voter population are predictively modeled to understand where they fit amongst the\r\nTarget Audiences identified by our research. This predictive modeling can also indicate what issues they\r\ncare about, and other factors likely to be salient in shaping voting behaviour.\r\n\r\nWhat this process offers is the opportunity to target communications at the scale of the individual.\r\n\r\nIn other words, Leave.EU will be able to ensure that every piece of digital or print advertising sent out is\r\ndirected at somebody who cares about the particular issue, or is likely to respond positively. This means\r\nthat your campaign can save money that would otherwise have been spent contacting voters who are\r\nvehemently pro-EU, and direct those resources into making more frequent contact with swing voters and\r\nsupporters you wish to mobilise as donors or volunteers.\r\n\r\nTo assist Leave.EU with using this wealth of information, Cambridge Analytica will develop a bespoke\r\nonline database tool with intuitive controls and powerful visualisation capacity. This will help campaign\r\nstaff to understand their audiences and plan strategy accordingly. New audiences can be identified using\r\nthe database querying tool, and pre-formatted Target Audiences can be displayed geographically or\r\naccording to other factors, all enabling a thorough understanding of the campaign and putting Leave.EU\r\nin the global vanguard of data-driven political campaigning.\r\n\r\nconnect\r\n\r\nconnect is our voter database utility,\r\nwhich helps you segment, view and understand your target audiences.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE\r\n\r\nANALYTICA\r\n\r\nTARGETED FUNDRAISING\r\n\r\nAlongside the TAA and Political Microtargeting programmes described on the preceding pages,\r\nCambridge Analytica will also design and execute a programme of donation solicitation amongst\r\nindividuals interested in Britain's EU status.\r\n\r\nThese could include both corporate and individual targets in the United States, UK or other\r\nCommonwealth countries. Depending on budget and required specifications, this programme would\r\nmake use of targeted digital advertising, direct mail, telephone marketing and other methodologies as\r\nappropriate to solicit campaign financing from individuals willing to support a campaign for Britain's\r\nindependence from the European Union.\r\n\r\nCambridge Analytica has significant experience designing and executing donation programmes, and\r\nwe can handle the entire process from the development of creative pieces and design of targeting\r\nframeworks to the scripting of telephone calls and production of digital animations and donation\r\ncollection websites.\r\n\r\nf+jL CAMBRIDGE\r\nV/\\ ANALYTICA\r\n\r\nAnalytica scl group\r\n\r\nNEW YORK: The News Corp.

We are, in particular, asked to consider whether the processing proposed to be\r\ncarried out under the Contract is lawful within the meaning of the Data Protection Act 1998\r\n(\"the DPA 1998\").\r\n\r\n2.\tWe have had the benefit of a conference with several staff members of CA and we have\r\nreviewed the UKIP Data Protection Policy and Privacy Policy which are freely available on the\r\nUKIP.org website.\r\n\r\n3.\tBased on the information with which we have been provided, for the reasons and with the\r\nqualifications set out below, we are of the opinion that it would be lawful for CA to carry out\r\nthe processing for UKIP proposed under the Contract.\r\n\r\nReasons\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\n4. The DPA 1998 provides a code setting out the manner and extent to which a person (whether\r\nan individual, corporate body, organisation or governmental agency) may use an individual's\r\npersonal information. The terminology of the DPA 1998 is key to an understanding of its\r\noperation. The use of personal information controlled by the Act is called \"processing\"; the\r\ninformation whose use is controlled by the Act is called \"personal data\";1 the controlling\r\n\r\n1 Section 1(1) of the DPA 1998 defines '\"personal data\" as data which relate to a living individual who\r\ncan be identified from those data, or from those data and other information which is in the possession\r\nof, or is likely to come into the possession of, the data controller; and it includes any expression of\r\n\r\n- 1 -\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\nmechanism over the use of personal information is called the \"data protection principles\"; and\r\nthe person subject to the main controls of the Act is called the \"data controller.\"\r\n\r\n5.\tThe 1998 Act recognises that the person who carries out the task of saving, holding, retrieving\r\netc (ie processing) personal information may be different from the person who decides what\r\nprocessing is to be carried out on that information. In other words, it recognises that\r\nsometimes there will be an arrangement where one person processes personal information by\r\ncarrying out the instructions of someone else - ie a data controller. In that situation, the first\r\nperson is called the \"data processor.\" As just noted, the 1998 Act is mostly concerned to\r\nregulate the conduct of the data controller rather than the data processor.\r\n\r\n6.\tThe 1998 Act also recognises that the use of some sorts of personal information requires a\r\ncloser degree of control than other personal information. The sort of information that is more\r\nclosely controlled is called \"sensitive personal information.\"2\r\n\r\n7.\tThe data protection principles are listed in Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Act. Much of the detail\r\nof those principles is spelled out in Part II of Schedule 1 to the Act, as well as in Schedules 2,\r\n3 and 4. The obligation to adhere to the data protection principles is imposed by s 4(4).\r\n\r\n8.\tA suite of exemptions is set out in Part IV of the Act (ss 27-38). There are further exemptions\r\nin Sch 7 to the Act and in regulations made under the Act. Where an exemption applies, it\r\nserves to relieve the data controller from some, but not all, of the data protection principles:\r\nsee s 27.\r\n\r\n9.\tNon-compliance with the s 4(4) obligation exposes the data controller to a court claim for\r\ncompensation. Where such a claim is made, the individual affected may seek recompense for\r\npecuniary loss, as well as for distress, suffered as a result of the breach of the principles.\r\nWhere such a claim is made, a court may also make coercive orders requiring the data\r\ncontroller to destroy, amend, erase etc that individual's information.\r\n\r\n10.\tQuite separately from any court claim, the Information Commissioner can investigate the data\r\nprocessing procedures of a data controller by issuing various notices (assessment, enforcement\r\nand so forth) with which a data controller must comply.\r\n\r\nopinion about the individual and any indication of the intentions of the data controller or any other\r\nperson in respect of the individual.\r\n\r\n2 Section 2 of DPA 1998 defines \"sensitive personal data\" as personal data consisting of information\r\nrelating to the data subject with regard to racial or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious beliefs\r\nor other beliefs of a similar nature; trade union membership; physical or mental health or condition;\r\nsexual life; the commission or alleged commission by the data subject of any offence; or any\r\nproceedings for any offence committed or alleged to have been committed by the data subject, the\r\ndisposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.\r\n\r\n- 2 -\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\n11. In short, a data controller is well advised to know and abide by the requirements of the Act\r\nwhen handling personal information.\r\n\r\nWhich (if any) of CA's processing will be regulated by the DPA 1998?\r\n\r\n12.\tAs we are instructed, the system used by CA is one that it has successfully used in the USA\r\nand elsewhere. It relies upon detailed analysis of data using a method that has not previously\r\nbeen used in the UK. The design of that analysis and the means of effecting it are all within\r\nthe exclusive domain of CA. While CA's clients will typically supply some of the raw data\r\nused in the system, CA adds further data to that client-sourced data, which it analyses in order\r\nto yield an output. CA is solely responsible for deciding what analysis will be carried out in\r\norder to supply the client with the output. The output does not identify specific individuals,\r\nbut is an abstraction of attributes arranged in way that is informative to the client.\r\n\r\n13.\tIt is proposed by CA to enter in to a contract with UKIP to provide data analysis and profiling\r\nfor the party to as part of UKIP's research into its membership. This research includes trying\r\nto ascertain the profile of a typical and likely UKIP member. UKIP intends to share the results\r\nof this research with Leave.EU, a campaign group with similar aims to UKIP.\r\n\r\n14.\tUKIP's data are split in to two types: data gathered from the membership information of\r\nmembers (\"Membership Data\"), and data gathered from the operation of the UKIP website\r\n(\"Website Data\"). The Membership Data are covered by the UKIP Data Protection Policy. The\r\nWebsite Data are covered by UKIP's Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n15.\tThe document entitled UKIP Data Protection Policy recites that UKIP:\r\n\r\n\"needs to gather and use certain information about individuals\"\r\nand that these individuals can include:\r\n\r\n\"members, supporters, enquirers, business contacts, employees and other people the\r\norganisation has a relationship with or may need to contact.\"\r\n\r\nThe policy is stated to\r\n\r\n\"describe how this personal data must be collected, handled and store to meet the\r\nparty's data protection standards - and to comply with the law.\"\r\n\r\nThe document spells out which people within UKIP may access the information covered by\r\nthe policy and the purpose for which they may access. It spells out that data should not be\r\nshared informally and that\r\n\r\n\"personal data should not be disclosed to unauthorised people, either within the\r\nparty or externally.\"\r\n\r\nThere are paragraphs relating to the deletion of out-of-date information and storage of\r\npersonal information. In summary, the policy is more concerned with telling UKIP staff and\r\nworkers how the party wants them to handle personal information than it is with the party's\r\nadvising individuals about whom the party holds information how the party may make use\r\nof that information. However, the document concludes:\r\n\r\n\"UKIP aims to ensure that individuals are aware that their data is being processed,\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\n- 3 -\r\n\r\nand that they understand:\r\n\r\n— How the data is being used\r\n— How to exercise their rights\r\n\r\nTo these ends, the party has a privacy statement, setting out how data relating to\r\nindividuals is used by the company.\r\n\r\nThis is available on request. A version of this statement is also available on the\r\nparty's website.\"\r\n\r\n16.\tThe UKIP web home page (http://www.ukip.org/) has at its foot a hyperlink to \"PRIVACY\r\nPOLICY.\" Clicking on that brings up a page headed \"PRIVACY POLICY\", which is what it\r\nsays it is. The page has four headings: \"Information We Collect\"; \"Third Party Services\";\r\n\"How We Use Your Information\"; and \"Queries\". The Privacy Policy opens:\r\n\r\n\"The UK Independence Party knows that you care how information about you is\r\nused and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be\r\ncollected by us when you use our online services, how the information will be used,\r\nand how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We\r\nwill not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this\r\nPrivacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect by other\r\nmeans (including offline) or from other sources.\"\r\n\r\nAs we understand it, apart from the website Privacy Policy UKIP has no other privacy policy.\r\nIn other words, the website Privacy Policy is the \"privacy statement\" referred to in UKIP Data\r\nProtection Policy, despite what appears in the opening paragraph of the website Privacy Policy.\r\nWe consider that it would be sensible for this to be checked with UKIP, but we have proceeded\r\non the assumption that it is correct.3\r\n\r\n17.\tThe website Privacy Policy provides that:\r\n\r\n\"Any information you provide, including your email address, will not be passed onto\r\nany third party (other than firms working on our behalf), except where you have\r\nsigned a petition or similar, where the petition will be presented to a third party.\"\r\n\r\nIt also provides that:\r\n\r\n\"How We Use Your Information\r\n\r\nWe use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you\r\nthe features and functionality of http://ukip.org.\"\r\n\r\n18.\tUKIP intend to provide CA with all of their Membership Data and Website Data, as well as\r\nsome anonymous membership questionnaires.\r\n\r\n19.\tIn relation to the Contract, the system will plainly involve the utilisation of personal data and\r\nsensitive personal data supplied to CA by UKIP. In addition, CA will use other types of data\r\navailable to it such as mosaic data, credit data and demographic data, some of which may be\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nPlainly, if it is not correct then we would need to re-visit our conclusions.\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\n- 4 -\r\n\r\npersonal data or sensitive personal data. CA will then analyse all this data using its\r\nproprietary method. For the purpose of carrying out its analysis, CA may further augment this\r\ndata with data from surveys conducted by CA. All of the CA data, including personal data and\r\nsensitive personal data, are or will be held and otherwise processed at their secure data centre\r\nin Scotland.\r\n\r\n20.\tAs we understand the operation of CA's proposed system, CA will be a \"data controller\" and\r\nnot simply a \"data processor.\"\r\n\r\n21.\tGiven that in the performance of the Contract the CA system will be analysing political\r\nopinions it will inevitably be processing both personal data and sensitive personal data.\r\n\r\n22.\tThe output (called \"the Analysed Dataset\" in the Contract) will be a psychological profile of\r\nclasses of elector and an assessment of the likelihood of each such class of elector to be\r\nconvinced of particular ideas and, most importantly, the messaging that would be most\r\neffective in convincing that class of elector (\"the Output\").\r\n\r\n23.\tThe Output will not itself contain any personal data or sensitive personal data. Rather, the\r\nOutput will be generic information based upon an analysis of the personal data described\r\nabove. Whilst a person could conjecture the identity of individuals from the Output, that\r\nconjecture would require an evaluative process separate from that provided by the CA service\r\nand the outcome of that evaluative process would remain conjectural.\r\n\r\n24.\tOn the basis that an individual will not be able to be identified from the Output and that even\r\nwith the raw data UKIP supplied to CA UKIP would not be able to identify individuals from\r\nthe Output, we are of the opinion that the Output itself would be not constitute personal data\r\nwithin the meaning of the DPA: see the definition of \"personal data.\" Thus, neither the\r\nsending by CA nor the receipt by UKIP of the Output would constitute processing of personal\r\ndata. As such, those forms of processing of the Output would not have to comply with the\r\ndata protection principles.\r\n\r\n25.\tOn the other hand, the receipt by CA from UKIP of the information described above will\r\nconstitute processing by CA of personal information. Indeed, given that it links each\r\nindividual to a political opinion (because it has been collected by a political party and the\r\nquantity and content of that information will associate that individual with support for the\r\nparty and its ideas), it will constitute the processing of sensitive personal information.\r\nSimilarly, the subsequent holding of that information by CA, its analysis (including its\r\ncombination with other information) and all the steps leading up to the production of the\r\nOutput will each constitute processing of personal information/sensitive personal information\r\nby CA. As such, in so processing that information, CA must comply with the requirements of\r\nthe DPA 1998.\r\n\r\n26.\tWe therefore now turn to consider whether what CA proposes to do with this information will\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\n- 5 -\r\n\r\nbe compliant with the requirements of the DPA 1998, i.e. whether the processing would\r\ncomply with each of the eight data protection principles.\r\n\r\nTo the extent that CA's processing is subject to the DPA 1998, is it lawful?\r\n\r\n27.\tPart 1 of Schedule 1 to the DPA 1998 contains the \"data protection principles.\" Under s 4(4)\r\nof the DPA 1998, a data controller (such as CA) must adhere to these data protection principles\r\nwhenever processing personal data.\r\n\r\nFirst data protection principle\r\n\r\n28.\tThe first data protection principle is:\r\n\r\n\"Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully and, in particular, shall not be\r\nprocessed unless-\r\n\r\n(a)\tat least one of the conditions in Schedule 2 is met, and\r\n\r\n(b)\tin the case of sensitive personal data, at least one of the conditions in\r\n\r\nSchedule 3 is also met.\"\r\n\r\n29.\tIt will be seen that there are three requirements that must be met in order for the processing\r\nof ordinary (ie non-sensitive) personal data to comply with the first data protection principle:\r\nthe data must be processed \"fairly\"; it must be processed \"lawfully\"; and at least one of the\r\nconditions in Schedule 2 must be met. In the case of sensitive personal data, there is a fourth\r\nrequirement: namely, that at least one of the conditions in Schedule 3 must be met.\r\n\r\n30.\tIn determining whether personal data are processed \"fairly,\" paragraphs 1-3 of Part II of\r\nSchedule 1 prescribe situations where the fairness will necessarily be met, situations where it\r\nwill not be met and, in relation to the remaining situations, certain matters to which regard is\r\nto be had in evaluating whether the data is being processed fairly.\r\n\r\n31.\tPut very generally, whether data is or is not being processed fairly revolves around how the\r\ndata controller obtained the personal information being processed: in particular, it is concerned\r\nwith whether the individual gave consent to the processing or was notified of it.\r\n\r\n32.\tParagraph 2 of Part II of Schedule 1 (which sets out required but not necessarily sufficient\r\nprocedures for \"fairness\") provides, so far as relevant:\r\n\r\n\"(1) Subject to paragraph 3, for the purposes of the first principle personal data are\r\nnot to be treated as processed fairly unless-\r\n\r\n(a)\tin the case of data obtained from the data subject, the data controller\r\nensures so far as practicable that the data subject has, is provided with,\r\nor has made readily available to him, the information specified in\r\nsub-paragraph (3), and\r\n\r\n(b)\tin any other case, the data controller ensures so far as practicable that,\r\nbefore the relevant time or as soon as practicable after that time, the\r\ndata subject has, is provided with, or has made readily available to\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\n- 6 -\r\n\r\nhim, the information specified in sub-paragraph (3).\r\n\r\n(2)\tIn sub-paragraph (1)(b) 'the relevant time' means-\r\n\r\n(a)\tthe time when the data controller first processes the data, or\r\n\r\n(b)\tin a case where at that time disclosure to a third party within a\r\nreasonable period is envisaged-\r\n\r\n(i)\tif the data are in fact disclosed to such a person within that\r\nperiod, the time when the data are first disclosed,\r\n\r\n(ii)\tif within that period the data controller becomes, or ought to\r\nbecome, aware that the data are unlikely to be disclosed to\r\nsuch a person within that period, the time when the data\r\ncontroller does become, or ought to become, so aware, or\r\n\r\n(iii)\tin any other case, the end of that period.\r\n\r\n(3)\tThe information referred to in sub-paragraph (1) is as follows, namely-\r\n\r\n(a)\tthe identity of the data controller,\r\n\r\n(b)\tif he has nominated a representative for the purposes of this Act, the\r\nidentity of that representative,\r\n\r\n(c)\tthe purpose or purposes for which the data are intended to be\r\nprocessed, and\r\n\r\n(d)\tany further information which is necessary, having regard to the\r\nspecific circumstances in which the data are or are to be processed, to\r\nenable processing in respect of the data subject to be fair.\"\r\n\r\n33.\tIn the present case, CA is not obtaining the personal data from the data subject: it is obtaining\r\nit from UKIP. Accordingly, sub-sub-paragraph 2(1)(b) (rather than sub-sub-paragraph 2(1)(a))\r\nwhich is applicable. As we understand it, CA has not started processing the data yet, so the\r\n\"relevant time\" has not been reached: but it is imminent. Putting it at its lowest, the\r\nrequirement is for CA to make readily available to the data subject the information specified\r\nin sub-paragraph 2(3). We consider that in order to satisfy this requirement CA should make\r\navailable on its website a general statement of the information in (3). This should be done at\r\nthe outset of processing. This will ensure that the processing is not deemed to offend the\r\nfairness requirement. But it does not follow that the processing is necessarily fair.\r\n\r\n34.\tSo far as is relevant, the only other statutory assistance given by Part II of Schedule 1 is in sub-\r\nparagraph 1(1) which states:\r\n\r\n\"In determining for the purposes of the first principle whether personal data are\r\nprocessed fairly, regard is to be had to the method by which they are obtained,\r\nincluding in particular whether any person from whom they are obtained is deceived\r\nor misled as to the purpose or purposes for which they are to be processed.\"\r\n\r\n35.\tWe have seen nothing to suggest that any of the personal data that UKIP is proposing to pass\r\nover to CA for the purpose of carrying out the contract was obtained by deception or in a\r\nmisleading way. Again, while of some assistance, satisfaction of sub-paragraph 1(1) does not\r\nnecessarily make the processing fair.\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\n- 7 -\r\n\r\n36.\tThe Information Commission has a statutory duty (s 51(1)) to:\r\n\r\n\"promote the following of good practice by data controllers and, in particular, so to\r\nperform his functions under this Act as to promote the observance of the\r\nrequirements of this Act by data controllers.\"\r\n\r\nOne of his functions (s 51(2)) is to:\r\n\r\n\"...arrange for the dissemination in such form and manner as he considers\r\nappropriate of such information as it may appear to him expedient to give to the\r\npublic about the operation of this Act, about good practice....and may give advice to\r\nany person as to any of those matters.\"\r\n\r\nThus, although statements of good practice from the Information Commissioner do not have\r\nthe status of a statute, where a data controller follows such statements in the processing of\r\npersonal data it is extremely unlikely that such processing will result in adverse\r\ndeterminations by the Commissioner.\r\n\r\n37.\tIn dealing with the fairness requirement in the first data protection principle, and specifically\r\nwhere the data controller acquires the personal information from another data controller, the\r\nCommissioner's current statement is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Some organisations share personal data with other organisations. For example,\r\ncharities working in the same field may wish to use or share supporters' information\r\nto allow reciprocal mailings. Some companies even trade in personal data, selling or\r\nrenting the information. The individuals concerned must still be treated fairly. They\r\nshould be told that their information may be shared, so they can choose whether or\r\nnot to enter into a relationship with the organisation sharing it.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, in this situation the Information Commissioner looks to the conduct of the\r\noriginal acquirer of the personal information — in this case UKIP.\r\n\r\n38.\tWe have set out above the relevant parts of the UKIP Data Protection Policy and UKIP's Privacy\r\nPolicy. In processing the personal data supplied by UKIP to it, CA is working on behalf of\r\nUKIP. The Privacy Policy expressly contemplates that UKIP may pass personal information it\r\nholds to others working on its behalf. UKIP has acted in accordance with the Commissioner's\r\nguidance. In short, provided that the requirements of para 2(3) are met, we consider that CA's\r\nprocessing will meet the fairness requirement of the first data protection principle.\r\n\r\n39.\tIn relation to the second requirement of the first data protection principle — that the\r\nprocessing be lawful — this essentially means that the processing does not otherwise offend\r\nany statutory provision. We have seen nothing to suggest any unlawfulness in the proposed\r\nprocessing of the personal data. The lawfulness requirement is thus satisfied.\r\n\r\n40.\tWe turn next to the third requirement of the first data protection principle, the requirement\r\nthat at least one of the conditions in schedule 2 is met. Schedule 2 comprises six paragraphs.\r\nThe first five are not relevant. The sixth is relevant. So far as relevant, it provides:\r\n\r\n\"(1) The processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\n- 8 -\r\n\r\nthe data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed,\r\nexcept where the processing is unwarranted in any particular case by reason of\r\nprejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the data subject.\"\r\n\r\n41.\tParagraph 6(1) contemplates a balancing exercise. On one side are the processing which is\r\nnecessary for the purposes of \"the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the\r\nthird party or parties to whom the data are disclosed.\" On the other side of the balance is the\r\nprejudice which the processing would cause to \"the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests\r\nof the data subject.\"\r\n\r\n42.\tBased on the information with which we have been provided, it is clear to us that the\r\nprocessing of personal information under the Contract is necessary for the legitimate interests\r\nboth of CA (to carry on its business) and of UKIP (to understand its constituents). On the\r\nother side of the balance, the processing is not going to impede the rights and freedoms or\r\nlegitimate interests of any data subject. The Contract will not involve an invasion of anyone's\r\nprivacy; there is no profiling of specific individuals. The Output will not contain any personal\r\ndata or sensitive personal data. We are firmly of the view that paragraph 6(1) is satisfied.\r\n\r\n43.\tThus, in relation to personal data that is not sensitive personal data, the processing\r\ncontemplated by the Contract complies with the first data protection principle.\r\n\r\n44.\tIn relation to sensitive personal data, the processing will also have to meet a paragraph in\r\nSchedule 3 to the DPA 1998. That Schedule has seven paragraphs. Paragraphs 2-3 and 5-7 are\r\ninapplicable. Paragraphs 1 and 4 provide:\r\n\r\n\"1. The data subject has given his explicit consent to the processing of the personal\r\ndata.\r\n\r\n4. The processing—\r\n\r\n(a)\tis carried out in the course of its legitimate activities by any body or\r\nassociation which —\r\n\r\n(i)\tis not established or conducted for profit, and\r\n\r\n(ii)\texists for political, philosophical, religious or trade-union\r\npurposes,\r\n\r\n(b)\tis carried out with appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of\r\ndata subjects,\r\n\r\n(c)\trelates only to individuals who either are members of the body or\r\nassociation or have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes,\r\nand\r\n\r\n(d)\tdoes not involve disclosure of the personal data to a third party without the\r\nconsent of the data subject.\"\r\n\r\n45. Although it is not as clear as it might have been, the Privacy Policy does state that by providing\r\nan email address, a person does consent to a certain amount of processing of his/her personal\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\n- 9 -\r\n\r\ninformation. It is worth setting out the whole of this part of the Privacy Policy:\r\n\r\n“By providing http://ukip.org your email address (including by 'following,' 'liking,'\r\nlinking your account to http://ukip.org, etc., on a third party website or network), you\r\nconsent to our using the email address to send you http://ukip.org related notices,\r\nincluding any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. You\r\nalso agree that we may send you notifications of activity on http://ukip.org to the\r\nemail address you give us, in accordance with any applicable privacy settings. We\r\nmay use your email address to send you other messages, such as newsletters,\r\nchanges to features of http://ukip.org, or other information. If you do not want to\r\nreceive such email messages, you may opt out using the unsubscribe button at the\r\nbottom of any email.\r\n\r\nFollowing termination or deactivation of your http://ukip.org account, http://ukip.org\r\nmay retain your profile information and user content for a reasonable time for\r\narchival purposes. Furthermore, http://ukip.org may retain and continue to use\r\nindefinitely all information (including user content) contained in your\r\ncommunications to other users or posted to public or semi-public areas of\r\nhttp://ukip.org after termination or deactivation of your account.\r\nhttp://ukip.org reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the user content\r\nyou post on http://ukip.org. We reserve the right to remove any such information or\r\nmaterial for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole\r\nopinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or\r\nto protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. http://ukip.org\r\nalso reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.\r\n\r\nAny information you provide, including your email address, will not be passed onto\r\nany third party (other than firms working on our behalf), except where you have\r\nsigned a petition or similar, where the petition will be presented to a third party.\"\r\n(emphasis added)\r\n\r\n46.\tAlthough there is only one reference using the word “consent\", the next sentence refers to\r\n“agree\" which we consider is in this context indistinguishable. More significantly, it is\r\nnecessary to read the whole quoted passage as one. While the later paragraphs do not refer\r\nto consent being deemed to be given to the passing on of personal information to third parties\r\nworking on UKIP's behalf by the provision of an email address, that is the sense of the passage.\r\nIf a person does not want this to happen, they are given the choice of opting out. But\r\notherwise, by providing their email address to UKIP they are consenting to it. Although not\r\nas clearcut as it might be, we consider that paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 is satisfied.\r\n\r\n47.\tAlthough it is not necessary to consider whether paragraph 4 is also met, on balance we incline\r\nto the view that it probably is. Our doubt revolves around an ambiguity in paragraph 4 which\r\nis not resolved by any guidance from the courts or the Commissioner. The doubt is whether\r\nthe processing must be carried out by the body or association or whether it can also cover\r\nprocessing carried out by a data controller in fulfilment of a contract with such a body or\r\nassociation. On the footing that it extends to the latter, paragraph 4 of Schedule 3 would also\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\n- 10 -\r\n\r\nbe met.\r\n\r\n48.\tIn any event, because paragraph 1 of Schedule 3 is met, the processing by CA of sensitive\r\npersonal data in the performance of the Contract will comply with the first data protection\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nSecond data protection principle\r\n\r\n49.\tThe second data protection principle is:\r\n\r\n\"Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes,\r\nand shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or\r\nthose purposes.\"\r\n\r\n50.\tCA must take care to ensure that their processing is not against the processes for which the\r\ndata was collected. Paragraph 6 of Part II of Schedule 1 to the DPA explains:\r\n\r\n\"In determining whether any disclosure of personal data is compatible with the\r\npurpose or purposes for which the data were obtained, regard is to be had to the\r\npurpose or purposes for which the personal data are intended to be processed by any\r\nperson to whom they are disclosed.\"\r\n\r\n51.\tGiven the nature of the datasets with which CA work it is unlikely that they will have been\r\ncollected for a purpose that is incompatible with CA's processing.\r\n\r\n52.\tIn any event, we consider that all forms of the processing contemplated to be carried out under\r\nthe Contract would be exempted from the second data protection principle by s 33 of the DPA\r\n1998. That provides, so far as relevant:\r\n\r\n\"(1) In this section- \"research purposes\" includes statistical or historical purposes;\r\n\r\n\"the relevant conditions\", in relation to any processing of personal data, means\r\nthe conditions-\r\n\r\n(a)\tthat the data are not processed to support measures or decisions with\r\nrespect to particular individuals, and\r\n\r\n(b)\tthat the data are not processed in such a way that substantial damage\r\nor substantial distress is, or is likely to be, caused to any data subject.\r\n\r\n(2)\tFor the purposes of the second data protection principle, the further processing\r\nof personal data only for research purposes in compliance with the relevant\r\nconditions is not to be regarded as incompatible with the purposes for which\r\nthey were obtained.\r\n\r\n(3)\t-(4)\t...\r\n\r\n(5) For the purposes of subsections (2) to (4) personal data are not to be treated as\r\nprocessed otherwise than for research purposes merely because the data are\r\ndisclosed-\r\n\r\n(a)\tto any person, for research purposes only,\r\n\r\n(b)\tto the data subject or a person acting on his behalf,\r\n\r\n(c)\tat the request, or with the consent, of the data subject or a person\r\n\r\n- 11 -\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\nacting on his behalf, or\r\n\r\n(d) in circumstances in which the person making the disclosure has\r\nreasonable grounds for believing that the disclosure falls within\r\nparagraph (a), (b) or (c).\"\r\n\r\n53.\tIn short, there is unlikely to be any issue with the second data protection principle\r\n\r\nThird data protection principle\r\n\r\n54.\tThe third data protection principle is:\r\n\r\n\"Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the\r\npurpose or purposes for which they are processed.\"\r\n\r\n55.\tGiven the nature of the analysis performed by CA it is very unlikely that the third data\r\nprotection principle will be contravened by the processing contemplated by the Contract.\r\n\r\nFourth data protection principle\r\n\r\n56.\tThe fourth data protection principle is:\r\n\r\n\"Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.\"\r\n\r\n57.\tParagraph 7 of Part II of Schedule 1 to the DPA explains:\r\n\r\n\"The fourth principle is not to be regarded as being contravened by reason of any\r\ninaccuracy in personal data which accurately record information obtained by the data\r\ncontroller from the data subject or a third party in a case where-\r\n\r\n(a)\thaving regard to the purpose or purposes for which the data were obtained\r\nand further processed, the data controller has taken reasonable steps to\r\nensure the accuracy of the data, and\r\n\r\n(b)\tif the data subject has notified the data controller of the data subject's view\r\nthat the data are inaccurate, the data indicate that fact.\"\r\n\r\n58.\tIn these circumstances it is exceptionally unlikely that the fourth data protection principle will\r\nbe breached by the processing contemplated by the Contract.\r\n\r\nFifth to eighth data protection principles\r\n\r\n59.\tThe remaining four data protection principles are:\r\n\r\n\"5.

This should be recorded in the\r\nContract.\r\n\r\n62.\tThe sixth principle is generally understood to mean that if a data subject makes a request\r\nunder s 7 of the DPA (ie a \"subject access request\"), the data controller must comply with the\r\nrequirements of ss 7-8.\r\n\r\n63.\tGiven the experience and expertise of CA, it is to be expected that it will be able to adhere to\r\nthe seventh data protection principle. We note in this regard that all the data will be stored\r\nin secure premises and on secure systems.\r\n\r\n64.\tIn relation to the eighth data protection principle, CA will not be transferring any data outside\r\nthe United Kingdom. Accordingly, that principle will not breached. Given that CA is foreign\r\ncompany, we consider it prudent that this be recorded in the Contract.\r\n\r\n65.\tWe therefore conclude, with the above caveats in mind that the CA system is lawful and its\r\noperation in general does not breach the DPA.\r\n\r\nMATTHEW RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nHENDERSON CHAMBERS\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE\r\n\r\nPHILIP COPPEL QC\r\n\r\nCORNERSTONE CHAMBERS\r\n\r\n2-3 GRAY'S INN SQUARE\r\n\r\n17 November 2015\r\n\r\n- 13 -\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am\r\n\r\n- 14 -\r\n\r\nC:\\Docs\\Cambridge Analytica Opinion\r\n18 Nov 2015 - 10:28am",

Lucas; Christian Matheson; Rebecca Pow; Giles Watling.\r\n\r\nQuestions 621-848\r\n\r\nWitness\r\n\r\nI: Alexander Nix, Chief Executive, Cambridge Analytica\r\n\r\nWritten evidence from witnesses:\r\n- Cambridge Analytica\r\n\r\nExamination of witnesses\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix, Chief Executive, Cambridge Analytica\r\n\r\nQ621 Chair: Good morning. Welcome to Alexander Nix to this further session\r\nof the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee and our inquiry on\r\nfake news and disinformation. During the course of our investigation so\r\nfar, it has been clear to us that understanding of data analytics and\r\nbehavioural patterns online is key to understanding the way that\r\nmessaging works. That is why we were particularly keen to talk to\r\nCambridge Analytica, which is one of the leading companies in the\r\nworld—I think it would be fair to say—in understanding the way in which\r\ndata analytics and behaviour activity works online.\r\n\r\nWe have a range of questions that we want to ask you, Mr Nix, about\r\nthat. We are also this morning publishing the letter you sent to me on 23\r\nFebruary following the evidence session we had in Washington, in which\r\nyou raised some concerns about things that were said about Cambridge\r\nAnalytica at that hearing that you wanted to correct for the record. I am\r\npublishing that letter this morning, but I wanted to start by asking a\r\ncouple of questions relating to that letter and to clear up a few things.\r\n\r\nOne of the issues you raised in the letter in response to Mr Matheson's\r\nquestion was to state that Cambridge Analytica had never had any\r\ninvolvement in the EU referendum campaign. To quote for the record for\r\npeople who may not have seen the letter, you say, \"Cambridge Analytica\r\nhad no involvement in the referendum, was not retained by any\r\ncampaign, and did not provide any services (paid or unpaid) to any\r\ncampaign.\" That is what you said in your letter. We are publishing that\r\ntoday but I wanted to be clear. You will understand why this confusion\r\nhas arisen about Cambridge Analytica's role, because there have been\r\npublic statements made by you that did associate you with the\r\nreferendum campaign and with Leave.EU in particular. Why are those\r\nprevious statements not correct but what you say now correct instead?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Let me start by saying thank you for the invitation to\r\ncome and speak to this Committee. Fake news is a credible threat to the\r\npublic and indeed to the industry that we work in, and we are pleased to\r\ntry to help in any way that we can.\r\n\r\nWe have been very consistent for the last two years about our\r\ninvolvement, or lack of involvement, in the EU referendum. There was\r\none statement only, which was put out erroneously, that indicated that\r\nwe were involved in the campaign. It was drafted by a slightly\r\noverzealous PR consultant who worked for us, and referenced work that\r\nwe hoped and intended to undertake for the campaign. Subsequently,\r\nwork was never undertaken. The moment that that statement went out\r\nwe were absolutely crystal clear to all the media outlets that we were not\r\ninvolved and that it had been released in error, and we tried to correct\r\nthe press again and again and again. Unfortunately, and somewhat\r\nironically, this was an example of fake news that was disseminated and\r\n\r\nspun out virally. By the time it had penetrated the internet it became a\r\nmatter of fact even though there was no fact behind it.\r\n\r\nQ622 Chair: So that I am clear, is this the statement? I will read from it. Tell\r\nme if this is the statement you are referring to: \"Recently Cambridge\r\nAnalytica has teamed up with Leave.EU—the UK's largest group\r\nadvocating for a British exit... from the European Union—to help them\r\nbetter understand and communicate with UK voters. We have already\r\nhelped supercharge Leave.EU's social media campaign by ensuring the\r\nright messages get to the right voters online\". Is that the statement you\r\nare referring to?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is the statement, and this was a statement that\r\nwas prepared in anticipation of working with that organisation and was\r\nreleased, unfortunately, ahead of any work starting. Again, it was an\r\nerror. We were very vocal about that at the time and we addressed it\r\nhead-on immediately when we realised that it had been put out.\r\n\r\nQ623 Chair: I have seen that quotation in an article for Campaign magazine,\r\nwhich is in your name.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is where it was put out.\r\n\r\nChair: Yes. It is an article in your name and it is still on their website\r\ntoday, so why have you not asked them to withdraw it if that statement\r\nwas put out in error?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I cannot speak to that personally, but I am sure that we\r\nhave asked them. I can double-check for you.\r\n\r\nQ624 Chair: I think we all understand that sometimes an over-eager press\r\nofficer might say the wrong thing. It is quite different when the leading\r\nfigure in a company signs off an article that goes out in their name and\r\nthe key fact in that argument is wrong. It does not just refer to an\r\nanticipated relationship. It says that you have already worked for them,\r\n\"We have already helped supercharge Leave.EU's social media\"\r\nmessaging and, in particular, references the growth in the Facebook page\r\nfor the campaign. Presumably that refers to work that has been done not\r\njust things you hope to do.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: While your point is valid—we have addressed it head-on\r\nagain and again—the facts of the matter are that we did no work on that\r\ncampaign or any campaigns. We were not involved in the referendum.\r\nWhile we could dwell on this, I think we should probably look at the facts\r\nof the matter, which are that we were not involved, period.\r\n\r\nQ625 Chair: What you are saying is clear. Unfortunately, the question will still\r\nkeep coming up because people will reference this and think it is odd that\r\na statement was put out that was totally untrue, when it refers to not just\r\nwork you hope to do but work that you have already done. This will not\r\nbe news to you, but in the Newsnight programme that you were\r\ninterviewed in, they had had footage of a Cambridge Analytica employee\r\nsitting in a press conference with Leave.EU. It was Brittany Kaiser, and\r\nshe talked about the fact that she would be working on running large-\r\n\r\nscale research for Leave.EU. That was in 2015. Was that work\r\nundertaken? Did she do that as a Cambridge Analytica employee or was\r\nthat done in a personal capacity?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It is not unusual, when you are exploring a working\r\nrelationship with a client, to speak in public together about the work that\r\nyou hope to undertake. That was simply an example of that.\r\n\r\nQ626 Chair: She was talking about work that they hoped to do, but that work\r\nwas not done.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Exactly right.\r\n\r\nQ627 Chair: When we talk about you or your organisation, when you say that\r\nwork was not done and there was never any work done, does that apply\r\nto not just Cambridge Analytica but all your affiliate companies and\r\ncompanies in your group as well?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is absolutely right. No company that falls under any\r\nof the group vehicles in Cambridge Analytica or SCL or any other\r\ncompany that we are involved with has worked on the EU referendum.\r\n\r\nChair: Any associates or anyone?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Or any associates.\r\n\r\nQ628 Chair: In April 2017, Andy Wigmore, the communications director at\r\nLeave.EU, put out a tweet in response to some news from the\r\nConservative party about the people it had hired to advise it on the last\r\ngeneral election for its digital campaign. He says, \"You should use\r\nCambridge Analytics—we did apparently can highly recommend them\".\r\nWhy would he have said that?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: You are going to have to speak to Andy about that. I\r\ncannot begin to second-guess why he would have said that. My\r\nunderstanding is that he subsequently changed that statement, but,\r\nagain, you would have to speak to him.\r\n\r\nQ629 Chair: He also put out another tweet saying, \"Leave.EU campaign brings\r\nin US voter data and messaging firm Cambridge Analytica\". That was a\r\nseparate tweet.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I do not know the date of that, but I can only assume\r\nthat at the time he was vying to be the designated leave campaign and\r\nthat by associating himself with a data analytics firm such as ours, which\r\nhad quite a high profile for our work in the United States in the US\r\npresidential primaries, he was hoping that would give him additional\r\ncredibility through association.\r\n\r\nQ630 Chair: That was in November 2015 and that was presumably after the\r\npress conference that Brittany Kaiser took part in as well. Again, that\r\nwould suggest that there was a working relationship between Cambridge\r\nAnalytica and Leave.EU at that time.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I do not know how to explain this to you more clearly:\r\nwe did not work with them. However you look at this or however it\r\n\r\nappears to you or whatever tweets other people have said about the\r\nsituation, we did no paid or unpaid work. We had no formalised\r\nrelationship with them. We did not work on the EU referendum with that\r\norganisation or any other organisation.\r\n\r\nQ631 Chair: The reason I think it is important that we ask these questions is\r\nthat we are publishing a written statement from you that seems to\r\ncorrect the record on this point. The reason the questions keep coming\r\nup is that what you have said today is clearly challenged by what you\r\nhave said in the past, or statements that have gone out in your name in\r\nthe past, and what people like Andy Wigmore have said and what other\r\nemployees at Cambridge Analytica have said in the past as well. We are\r\nnow being asked to believe that the version of reality that was portrayed\r\nat the end of 2015 and 2016 is false, and the current statement is that\r\nthere was no work of any kind done by either Cambridge Analytica or any\r\nassociates during the referendum. They are at such odds it is not\r\nunreasonable that these questions keep coming up.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: You are looking at that in isolation. As I said before, that\r\npress release went out in error. After it went out, we were very quick to\r\ngo to the press and to correct it and to say to them, \"This was a mistake.\r\nFor the record, we are not doing any work. We have not been retained or\r\ncontracted by any of these organisations\". We consistently put this\r\nmessage out over a two-year period. One press release you are referring\r\nto was instantly corrected, and we have been consistent in our messaging\r\never since, so I do not think your line of inquiry is entirely fair.\r\n\r\nQ632 Chair: It is an article, not a press release, in your name, and it is still on\r\nthe website of the organisation that published it, in your name. It has not\r\nbeen taken down.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is out of our control, clearly.\r\n\r\nChair: You could have made a request to them.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We have made several requests to leading newspaper\r\npublications to retract statements that we have been involved with this.\r\nWe have told news outlets, and we have put out our own press releases,\r\nbut unfortunately we are not always successful in these entreaties.\r\n\r\nQ633 Chair: It is normal for companies, when they are pitching for work—and\r\nfrom what you said it sounded like you were in the process of pitching for\r\nwork for Leave.EU even if it did not come about. Probably a fair\r\ninterpretation of the article we have been discussing is that you\r\nanticipated that you were going to be hired to do some work for them\r\nand that did not happen. What sort of work was done in order to pitch?\r\nNormally you go out and see prospective clients and you pitch to them\r\nand show them what you can do and the value you could add if you were\r\nhired.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is exactly right. We have a political division. It is\r\nnot uncommon for us to go and speak to political parties. Indeed, in this\r\ncountry I think I have spoken with every political party—or at least been\r\napproached by Labour, Liberal Democrats, UKIP, SNP, Conservatives—on\r\n\r\nhow we might be able to help them with their campaigns, various\r\ndifferent campaigns, and to present our services, talk about our track\r\nrecord, our extensive 27-year history in managing election campaigns\r\naround the world, the technologies that we have developed to help\r\ncampaigning and make it more efficient and then to talk about how our\r\nservices might be most relevant to the clients that we are seeking to\r\nassist. I think that is pretty common practice.\r\n\r\nQ634 Chair: I used to work in the advertising industry many years ago, part of\r\nthe \"Mad Men\" style mass messaging industry that you say is now dead.\r\nWhat was normal there is that you would produce draft campaigns. You\r\nwould say, \"If you hired us, these are some of the advertisements that\r\nwe would run for you.\" Given that what you do is for many people, and\r\nprobably for many of your clients, quite a new area of activity, do you\r\ncreate demonstrations, saying, \"This is a sample of the sorts of work we\r\nwould do for you based on our understanding of this issue and the\r\nunderstanding of your audience. Here are some examples of the work we\r\nwould do if we were hired\"?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Unlike the \"Mad Men\" days of advertising where it is\r\ncreative-led, so you can draw on the imagination to come up with these\r\nsorts of examples, our communications are rooted in data and in science.\r\nAs a result, in order to produce these things there is considerably more\r\ntime and effort and work involved and we also need access to the\r\nappropriate datasets. It would be almost impossible for us to provide a\r\nclient with a meaningful demonstration of what we might be able to do\r\nfor them unless we have access to their data and have spent a lot of time\r\nmodelling. More often—I would say that this is always is the case—we will\r\nsimply show them work from other projects that we have worked on, to\r\ngive them an understanding of the sort of work that we might be able to\r\ndeliver to them.\r\n\r\nQ635 Chair: In your discussions with Leave.EU, did they say that they had a\r\ndataset that they could make available to you in order to assist targeting\r\nin that campaign?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I am not sure that they did have a huge dataset or any\r\ndataset. I would have to revert to you on that. I think the idea was that\r\nwe would help them go out and capture their data for them.\r\n\r\nQ636 Ian C. Lucas: I have a quotation in front of me, dated 8 February 2017,\r\nfrom Bloomberg Businessweek: \"We did undertake some work with\r\nLeave.eu, but it's been significantly over-reported\". Are you saying that\r\nthat is not correct, you never said that?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: What I am saying is that the work we undertook was\r\nexploring a business relationship together.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: You explored a business relationship but you did not begin\r\na business relationship?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is correct, sir.\r\n\r\nQ637 Ian C. Lucas: Do you know who Arron Banks is?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I do know who Arron Banks is.\r\n\r\nQ638 Ian C. Lucas: Have you read this book?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I know I have not.\r\n\r\nQ639 Ian C. Lucas: It is called The Bad Boys of Brexit and it was sent to me\r\nby Arron Banks. Do you have a copy in your office?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is correct. I was given a copy as well.\r\n\r\nQ640 Ian C. Lucas: Can I suggest you read it, Mr Nix, because on 22 October\r\n2015, according to this book, Mr Bank says, \"We have hired Cambridge\r\nAnalytica, an American company that uses 'big data and advanced\r\npsychographics' to influence people\". Are you saying that is incorrect?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I am saying that is incorrect.\r\n\r\nQ641 Ian C. Lucas: Were you aware of that statement?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I saw the statement in the book.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: You said you had not read it.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I have not read the book. I have seen the pages\r\nrelevant to Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nQ642 Ian C. Lucas: You are aware of that statement.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes, I am aware of that statement.\r\n\r\nQ643 Ian C. Lucas: Do you think that improves the business reputation of\r\nCambridge Analytica?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Unfortunately, that is something that is out of our\r\ncontrol. We have spoken to Mr Banks about this statement, and we spoke\r\nto Mr Wigmore about some of the statements that he made. We told\r\nthem that we disagreed with them and that they were not true. I believe\r\nthat they retracted some of their statements. The book came out, and it\r\nwas already published by time I knew that that statement was going to\r\nbe included in it. There was very little that I could do at the time to\r\nchange that.\r\n\r\nQ644 Ian C. Lucas: You could have sued, couldn't you? You could have sued if\r\nit was damaging to the reputation of Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I could have but I did not think that was adequate use\r\nof time and resources.\r\n\r\nQ645 Ian C. Lucas: What he says is not true?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is not true.\r\n\r\nQ646 Ian C. Lucas: He is a liar.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It is not true.\r\n\r\nQ647 Ian C. Lucas: He not only says that he used Cambridge Analytica; he\r\nsaid, specifically, that he hired you.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is not true.\r\n\r\nQ648 Ian C. Lucas: There are no financial payments from Leave.EU to\r\nCambridge Analytica or any of associates?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Let me be absolutely crystal clear about this. I do not\r\nknow how many ways I can say this. We did not work for Leave.EU. We\r\nhave not undertaken any paid or unpaid work for them, okay? There is\r\nnothing else I can add to that that is going to clarify that statement in\r\nany more detail.\r\n\r\nQ649 Ian C. Lucas: Mr Nix, I am sorry, but I am going to quote back to you\r\nwhat you said, which is, \"We did undertake some work with Leave.EU\". It\r\nis in the quotation, and you have just said exactly the opposite. Which is\r\ntrue?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I was using the word \"work\" to mean that we met with\r\nthem to discuss an opportunity. That is working. Unfortunately, having\r\nmeetings, even if they do not lead anywhere, is still work but it does not\r\nentail the sort of relationship that you are trying to suggest existed\r\nbetween their organisation and our company.\r\n\r\nQ650 Ian C. Lucas: Would you disclose your bank statements to show that no\r\npayments have been made from Leave.EU to Cambridge Analytica?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes, I would. I would be pleased to do that.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: I would be very grateful if you would send those to the\r\nCommittee so that we can check them.\r\n\r\nQ651 Simon Hart: Why are you so desperate to distance yourself from\r\nLeave.EU?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I am not. I am desperate to make sure that the facts of\r\nthe matter are crystal clear, because that is the purpose of this inquiry,\r\nalthough I thought the purpose of this inquiry was that I could help\r\ninform the Committee on how data and targeting are used in\r\ncommunications.\r\n\r\nQ652 Chair: Absolutely, and believe me we do want to come on to that. It is\r\njust that because you raised this in your letter to us we feel this is\r\nsomething we have to bottom out with you.\r\n\r\nSimon Hart: Keep going. You were just getting to the end of that.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I was simply saying that we were trying to establish the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nQ653 Simon Hart: You suggested that the work that was involved was around\r\npreparatory discussions that might or might not have led to some form of\r\ncontract. As a way of expanding on the answers you gave to Mr Lucas,\r\nwhat went wrong? Have you any idea why you did not get the job? Have\r\nyou any idea why Arron Banks is apparently so determined to argue that\r\nyou did? I do not understand how something so simple could become so\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Deals fall down or transactions fall down for all manner\r\nof reasons. It could be price, or it could be personalities.\r\n\r\nQ654 Simon Hart: What was it in this instance?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: There simply was not the appetite to move forward.\r\n\r\nQ655 Simon Hart: By you or by them?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think by both parties. We did not feel that the\r\nmarriage value of Cambridge Analytica working with Leave.EU, and\r\nclearly vice versa, was going to bear a fruitful and successful relationship.\r\n\r\nQ656 Simon Hart: Yet it would seem that Leave.EU are, according to you,\r\nmaking claims now that suggested that that relationship did exist. Why, if\r\nthere was not the will go forward and if there was not the will to enter\r\ninto any sort of contract, do you think that they are misrepresenting the\r\ntruth or, as you put it, commenting inaccurately?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I cannot possibly speculate on Arron Banks or Andy\r\nWigmore or anyone else's motivations. That would be an unfair question.\r\n\r\nQ657 Simon Hart: A final point on this, and I think we will come back to the\r\ndata element. There is a sense of irony in the way you seem to have\r\nfound yourself to be the victims of misinformation being peddled online,\r\nwhich is arguably one of the accusations that is made about your\r\ncompany since you assist people in playing to the fears of vulnerable\r\nsections of the electorate in order to alter their voting plans. Do you set a\r\nmoral compass anywhere in the manner in which you advise clients on\r\nvulnerable-voter sections in order to try to move them from one position\r\nto another? Do you see that as a positive contribution to society or do\r\nyou just say, \"They are paying the bills, therefore we will provide\r\nwhatever it is they want\"? Where does the social responsibility sit in all\r\nthis?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think that is another entirely unfair question that\r\nstems from a total misunderstanding about what it is that we are trying\r\nto do and how we help our clients. We are trying to use data and\r\ntechnology to allow campaigns to engage with voters in a more informed\r\nand relevant way. We are trying to make sure that voters receive\r\nmessages on the issues and policies that they care most about, and we\r\nare trying to make sure that they are not bombarded with irrelevant\r\nmaterials. That can only be good. That can only be good for politics, it\r\ncan only be good for democracy and it can be good in the wider realms of\r\ncommunication and advertising.\r\n\r\nQ658 Simon Hart: It is not an unfair question to simply report the fact that\r\nsome people consider the manner in which the data is used for electoral\r\npurposes is quite subliminal. It is arguably manipulative. I am simply\r\nasking for comment; I am not expressing a view myself. Quite a lot of\r\npolitical parties wish they could afford your services, I suspect, but they\r\ndo not. I am simply asking whether there is any element of this that\r\ncauses you concern. If you are trying to nudge—we were all watching the\r\npresentation you made yesterday, where you are trying to help people\r\n\r\nmove from one voting position to another. It is not anything that is\r\nparticularly drastic; it is just moving a couple of notches on the dial. Do\r\nyou have any comments about whether it is unusual when you see a\r\npolitical party using the advice that you have given perhaps to alarm\r\ncertain sections of the voting community into taking a position on the\r\nbasis of what, in the old-fashioned term, would be subliminal advertising?\r\nIs that an unfair accusation?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Let's start by establishing the fact that the use of big\r\ndata and predictive analytics in political campaigns was something that\r\nwas really championed by Obama's campaign in 2008. They were the\r\nones who made the significant advances in what is known now as micro-\r\ntargeting—the use of data to start to look at the electorate as very small\r\ngroups of people, hopefully, ideally as individuals as opposed to\r\nhomogeneous masses, and to start to serve them most relevant\r\nmessages. Again in 2012, the Democrats pioneered the use of\r\naddressable advertising technology in order to improve the way that they\r\nuse this data to target people as individuals.\r\n\r\nAs Mr Collins well knows, they have been using these sorts of techniques\r\nin the realm of advertising to personalise advertising for many years—\r\ndecades even—as they seek to build relationships between brands and\r\ntheir consumers such that you do not get blanketed with generic\r\nmessaging but everything becomes more relevant to you. That is an\r\nentire industry that is moving in this direction. It is not Cambridge\r\nAnalytica. All we have simply done is look at the industry—the advertising\r\nindustry—and at what is going on in the political industry, and we have\r\ntaken the best practices and in a very short of time we have replicated\r\nthem and, I would like to say, improved on some of these techniques and\r\nmethodologies and served them up to a different political party in order\r\nto help them have an equal chance of competing in a free and fair\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nI think part of the issue is that our candidate is somewhat polarising and\r\nso people see the work that we did in a negative light, and they refuse to\r\naccept the fact that Clinton's machine was twice the size or three times of\r\nanything that we were doing for Trump. She had hundreds of data\r\nscientists and digital practitioners working for her. They were using very\r\nsimilar techniques, and they were targeting the audience in a very similar\r\nway, yet they do not come under the limelight and they do not get the\r\nscrutiny that we get simply because of the candidate involved.\r\n\r\nI think if you look at the industry and you say to yourself, \"Is it good for\r\npolitics that you can make communications more relevant, that you can\r\nstart to run a national campaign that involves millions or tens of millions\r\nor even hundreds of millions of voters and you can start to treat that\r\ncampaign as you would a small mayoral election or a local election in the\r\nUK and you can start to speak to press releases about very local concerns\r\nthat are relevant to them?\" Whether it is speeding cameras or regulation\r\nof parking permits or whatever it is—things that matter as opposed to\r\nblanket messaging—that has to be good to make politics more personal,\r\nmore individualised and more engaging.\r\n\r\nQ659 Simon Hart: Last question, and I should know the answer to this: were\r\nyou involved in the 2017 election here?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No.\r\n\r\nQ660 Simon Hart: 2015?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: As a rule of thumb, we do not involve ourselves in\r\npolitics in the UK.\r\n\r\nQ661 Chair: You said as a rule of thumb, but have you?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I have been with the company for about 14 years and I\r\nhave never worked on a campaign in the UK, simply because, as a\r\npredominantly British campaign, we think it would be complex and\r\npossibly divisive to ask our employees and staff to support a particular\r\npolitical party in the country that they reside in.\r\n\r\nQ662 Chair: Following up, you took umbrage at one of Simon's questions\r\nabout playing on people's fears, but you gave a presentation about your\r\nwork for the Ted Cruz campaign where you demonstrated that, based on\r\nthe psychological profile of the audience, you might use an advertisement\r\nthat played on a woman's fear of being attacked in her own home to\r\nsupport the gun lobby. You might say that techniques like that are used\r\nby other people, but is that not a good example of the sort of campaign\r\nthat Mr Hart was referring to?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Both sides used fear of spending and fear of economic\r\nexclusion as arguments for staying and remaining in Europe. I think\r\npresenting a fact that is underpinned by an emotion is not\r\nfearmongering. If you believe that yourself, it is very sensible. I think\r\nthere is an argument to say that, in the particular instance you are\r\ntalking about, there are people who look to the second amendment for\r\nself-protection. In fact, I would say there are quite a lot of people who\r\nfall into that bucket.\r\n\r\nQ663 Chair: In that example there that you gave, fear was the emotion that\r\nyou were playing on.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: You are looking at the drivers that are going to influence\r\nthe decision making.\r\n\r\nChair: In that case, the driver that was selected in that example for that\r\ndecision maker was fear.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: The fear of being unable to protect yourself.\r\n\r\nChair: The answer to that question is yes?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes, in that case.\r\n\r\nQ664 Christian Matheson: Who is Brittany Kaiser?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Brittany Kaiser is an employee of Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nQ665 Christian Matheson: Is she still an employee?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: As of three years, I believe—three or four years.\r\n\r\nChristian Matheson: Is she still an employee?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: She is still an employee.\r\n\r\nQ666 Christian Matheson: She spoke, representing Cambridge Analytica, at a\r\npanel on the launch of Leave.EU, did she not?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I believe so.\r\n\r\nQ667 Christian Matheson: Representing Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Representing our proposed involvement as a company\r\nthat was going to support Leave.EU.\r\n\r\nQ668 Christian Matheson: She said at the time that, \"The most important\r\npart of this referendum is appealing to first time and apathetic voters\".\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ669 Christian Matheson: We have had the press release put out by the\r\njunior press officer—that was scotched straight away—but your\r\ninvolvement with Leave.EU continued up until the very launch and her\r\nspeaking at that launch.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: She was not speaking as a consultant to Leave.EU, she\r\nwas speaking as a representative of Cambridge that was seeking to do\r\nsome work for Leave.EU.\r\n\r\nQ670 Christian Matheson: Did she get paid for being on that panel?\r\nAlexander Nix: No, she did not.\r\n\r\nQ671 Christian Matheson: We had the tweet from 29 November, which again\r\nwas quickly being scotched by Andy Wigmore, but a couple of months\r\nlater, on 10 February 2016, you were quoted in Campaign magazine as\r\nsaying, \"Recently Cambridge Analytica has teamed up with Leave.EU... to\r\nhelp them better understand and communicate with UK voters. We have\r\nalready helped supercharge Leave.EU's social media campaign\". I know\r\nyou are unhappy with the line of questioning, but it is yet another piece\r\nof evidence, is it not, Mr Nix, that is contradictory to the statement that\r\nyou have given in your letter to the Chairman?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think it is the same piece of evidence that has already\r\nbeen brought up, so rather than go round the houses and have exactly\r\nthe same conversation that we had 20 minutes ago, we have probably\r\naddressed this one.\r\n\r\nQ672 Christian Matheson: My fear is that there are several individual pieces\r\nof contradictory evidence that provide a weight to each other.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No, there are two pieces of evidence that suggested an\r\nassociation, and we have addressed them both.\r\n\r\nQ673 Paul Farrelly: I want to try to close this opening line of questioning in\r\nmy own mind, because I fear that I am hearing the English language\r\n\r\nchanging in my ears as this session has gone on. You firstly described\r\nthat you were not working for someone, but by \"work\" you meant that\r\nyou had meetings about working for someone, which to my mind does\r\nnot count as working for someone, so that rather confused me. We have\r\ntwo sets of characters: you and Mr Banks. I use the book as a coffee mat\r\nin my office, because we were all sent unsolicited copies of it during the\r\nelection. Mr Banks is saying, \"Hey, we are hiring Cambridge Analytica\",\r\nand you are wanting to be Cambridge Analytica working with Leave.EU,\r\nso you are both going around professing love for each other and your\r\nintention to get hitched. Then you say there was no marriage value in\r\nthis. What did you mean by that?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That we did not get hitched, to use your metaphor. To\r\nuse your metaphor, we dated each other, we had a couple of dinners but\r\nwe did not get married. Again, how can I spell this out to you? It is pretty\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\nQ674 Paul Farrelly: I am continuing your metaphor. I do not know what a\r\nmarriage value is, so perhaps you could help me. There was no marriage\r\nvalue in it for you. What do you mean?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: The idea that when two parties come together, the sum\r\nof the relationship is better than the individuals staying on their own.\r\n\r\nQ675 Paul Farrelly: I am still confused as to why your relationship broke\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I am sure, as experienced businesspeople, you\r\nunderstand that there are often situations where you engage in\r\nconversations about working together with clients and they do not lead to\r\na relationship being formed. Unfortunately, this is the nature of business.\r\n\r\nQ676 Paul Farrelly: Could you spell it out? Did they not think you could\r\ndeliver or were they not prepared to pay the rate that you wanted? Could\r\nyou be a little bit clearer?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I cannot be more clear because I cannot recall. This was\r\nfour years ago or three years ago. It was one meeting three years ago\r\nthat did not lead to business. We do dozens of meetings every day and\r\nsome of them lead to contracts and some of them do not, so I cannot be\r\nmore clear. All I know is that we met some representatives from\r\nLeave.EU, we had some discussions, but no business was taken forward.\r\n\r\nQ677 Paul Farrelly: It also led to a presence on a launch platform for\r\nsomething that is pretty seminal in the recent history of this country, but\r\nyour memory is not very clear.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: At the time we were preoccupied with some fairly\r\nimportant work in the United States and other countries as well.\r\n\r\nQ678 Chair: Mr Nix, you are very clear in saying that Cambridge Analytica\r\nreceived no payment for any work relating to the referendum. Is that also\r\nthe case for SCL, your parent company?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It is not our parent company, but that is also the case,\r\nyes.\r\n\r\nQ679 Rebecca Pow: I want to look at the system that you used—I think you\r\nmight describe it as a trait-profiling system, the OCEAN system—and at\r\nhow you gather data and what you include. Could you very briefly explain\r\nthe OCEAN method to us?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Obviously, depending on which territory you are\r\noperating in, there are different means to gather data depending on the\r\nlegislative environment available. In a country such as the United States,\r\nwe are able to commercially acquire large datasets on citizens across the\r\nUnited States—on adults across the United States—that comprise of\r\nconsumer and lifestyle data points. This could include anything from their\r\nhobbies to what cars they drive to what magazines they read, what\r\nmedia they consume, what transactions they make in shops and so forth.\r\nThese data are provided by data aggregators as well as by the big brands\r\nthemselves, such as supermarkets and other retailers. We are able to\r\nmatch these data with first-party research, being large, quantitative\r\nresearch instruments, not dissimilar to a poll. We can go out and ask\r\naudiences about their preferences, their preference for a particular\r\npurchases—whether they prefer an automobile over another one—or\r\nindeed we can also start to probe questions about personality and other\r\ndrivers that might be relevant to understanding their behaviour and\r\npurchasing decisions.\r\n\r\nQ680 Rebecca Pow: I think the stated commercial aim of the SCL Group said\r\nthat you then collate all this information to micro-target people with all\r\nyour analysis in order to influence their long-term behaviour. Can you\r\ngive an example or a couple of examples of where this has been very\r\nsuccessful?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Let me try to route this into something that is a bit more\r\nrelatable. If you were an automotive company and you were seeking to\r\nadvertise your product to an audience, just knowing whether that\r\naudience was more interested in the engine and performance of the\r\nvehicle, as opposed to the safety features or the boot space or anything\r\nelse, is going to be very relevant to how you communicate with them.\r\nThat is an example of one or two data points. If you can expand on that\r\nand start to really understand what it is that you, as an individual, care\r\nabout in purchasing decisions—purchasing a car for instance—you can\r\nstart to tailor the product to the individual and start to tailor the\r\ncommunication in a similar way. Then you can talk about, in the case of\r\nsomebody who cares about the performance of a vehicle, how it handles\r\nand its metrics for speeding up and braking and torque and all those\r\nother things.\r\n\r\nQ681 Rebecca Pow: I assume you are gathering all this data on the British\r\npopulation as well.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Obviously there is a different set of regulations in the EU\r\nas opposed to the US. The EU is an opt-in data culture as opposed to an\r\nopt-out data culture, as is the case in the United States, so the datasets\r\n\r\nthat we have in the UK, for instance, are not the same as those that we\r\nhave in the US.\r\n\r\nQ682 Rebecca Pow: Does any of the data come from Facebook? I have read\r\nthat you have said that within so many \"likes\" you can almost predict\r\nwhat somebody is going to think about something, or indeed possibly\r\nhow somebody might vote, and that you might know more about them\r\nthan, say, their partner or spouse or work colleague does within a few\r\nsimple steps. Is that right?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I have read a similar article. It was not published by us\r\nor written by us, I should say. It was written by an academic active in the\r\nspace, so I cannot comment on whether that is true or not. We do not\r\nwork with Facebook data, and we do not have Facebook data. We do use\r\nFacebook as a platform to advertise, as do all brands and most agencies,\r\nor all agencies, I should say. We use Facebook as a means to gather\r\ndata. We roll out surveys on Facebook that the public can engage with if\r\nthey elect to.\r\n\r\nQ683 Rebecca Pow: But you can put your micro-targeted messages, as you\r\nwere saying, on Facebook as advertisements to try to persuade people or\r\nnudge them in one direction or another.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We are platform-agnostic. We will match our offline data\r\nsegments with any platform out there. Facebook obviously is an\r\nextremely prevalent platform and has an incredible global reach so it is a\r\ngo-to platform of choice for many or most agencies, but if there are other\r\nmore-targeted platforms, we would use those.\r\n\r\nQ684 Rebecca Pow: We had a gentleman before our panel called David\r\nCarroll, who was an associate professor of media design in the States. He\r\nsaid that there is no indication of where Cambridge Analytica obtained its\r\ndata for any of your rankings. Do you not feel people ought to know\r\nwhere you are getting your data from and then what you are doing with\r\nit, how you are sharing it, whether you are processing it or even whether\r\npeople ought to have a right to be able to delete it?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In the United Kingdom, individuals, as governed by EU\r\nlaw and data protection regulation, are entitled to make a subject access\r\nrequests and, as they will be able to under GDPR with all companies, they\r\nwill be able to ask for their data and have that data removed from those\r\ncompanies' databases. We are fully complicit with the law and the\r\nlegislation that is currently in place.\r\n\r\nQ685 Rebecca Pow: Do you see yourselves as being an all-powerful presence\r\nwith all the knowledge and data that you have and that it is not\r\nsurprising people are trying to find out whether you are doing anything\r\nperhaps you should not do in the way of influencing elections? You do\r\nseem to be in a position where, with all your knowledge and your\r\npowerful data, you could do that.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It is very flattering that you suggest that people might\r\nsee us as having these incredible powers. What we are doing is no\r\ndifferent from what the advertising industry at large is doing across the\r\n\r\ncommercial space. We are a small technology company that is trying to\r\ndevelop best-in-practice technologies. We are not a political agency, and\r\nwe do not have a political ideology. We work on as many elections each\r\nyear that are left of centre as are right of centre. We only work for\r\nmainstream political parties; we do not work for fringe actors. We only\r\nwork in free and fair democracies. The science of political campaigning\r\ngoes back hundreds of years and what we are doing is a very natural\r\nevolution to what has been done before, and what is being done by many\r\nother people as well.\r\n\r\nQ686 Rebecca Pow: Doesn't the very fact that you are working on political\r\ncampaigns mean that you must be influencing them, given that your\r\nremit is to influence people's long-term behaviour?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: All campaign management consultancies or agencies are\r\nthere to help their customers or their clients, as a good advertising\r\nagency is there to help the brands that it represents. We are there to\r\nmake sure that our candidates are able to communicate with the\r\nelectorate in the most relevant and effective way. That is what campaign\r\nconsultancies do, as most of the people in this room should well know\r\nbecause of their involvement in politics.\r\n\r\nQ687 Ian C. Lucas: Do you share data between, for example, SCL and\r\nCambridge Analytica?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: SCL is a very different company to Cambridge Analytica.\r\nIt is a different company that has different employees who sit in a\r\ndifferent office. It has a different board and a different board of advisers.\r\nIt has different datasets, and it has different clients. The short answer is\r\nno. The only relationship between Cambridge Analytica and SCL is some\r\nshareholders. Apart from that, they are completely separate entities.\r\n\r\nQ688 Ian C. Lucas: There would never be circumstances when you would\r\ntransfer data from SCL to Cambridge Analytica?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We could transfer data from Cambridge Analytica to\r\nSCL, but because SCL is a company that operates in the government and\r\ndefence space, it acts as company that has secret clearance—X-list\r\naccreditation in the UK—so we could not transfer data the other way.\r\n\r\nQ689 Ian C. Lucas: You could transfer data from Cambridge Analytica to SCL,\r\nyou said?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Certain data, yes.\r\n\r\nQ690 Ian C. Lucas: Are there any individuals who work for both organisations?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: There are individuals like myself who, at a high level, sit\r\non a board of both organisations, but there are no employees who work\r\nfor both organisations.\r\n\r\nQ691 Ian C. Lucas: Is it your understanding that if I lawfully give one of those\r\nbusinesses information about me, another one of those businesses can\r\nuse that information?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I said certain data. There are certain data that we can\r\ngo out and commercially—I am talking about the United States, by the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: I am talking about the UK.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In the UK that is not our practice.\r\n\r\nQ692 Ian C. Lucas: It is not your practice. Is that because it is unlawful?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We do not share data. No, it is simply because there is a\r\ndifferent legislative environment here.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: So it is because it is unlawful.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In America, we can go out and acquire data. In the UK,\r\nwe can still work with data, but as a data processor not as data\r\ncontroller. We can work with client data. I am sure you are familiar with\r\nthe distinction between the two. We never own these data; we are simply\r\nprocessing these data on behalf of our clients.\r\n\r\nQ693 Christian Matheson: Very briefly on that—going back to the answer you\r\ngave to Mr Lucas about not having any common employees, just common\r\nshareholders—the registered representative with the Information\r\nCommissioner for Cambridge Analytica is Jordanna Zetter. Does that\r\nsound right?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Sorry, the registered representative for—\r\n\r\nChristian Matheson: With the Information Commissioner.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Right.\r\n\r\nQ694 Christian Matheson: Is it not the case that she is also publicly named\r\nas the Operations Executive for SCL Elections Ltd and Cambridge\r\nAnalytica?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Jordanna has been acting as the liaison in an\r\nadministrative capacity for helping the ICO with some of their inquiries\r\ninto data and data protection. We have a data compliance team who are\r\nundertaking the work. Her role is more about co-ordination and\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nQ695 Christian Matheson: You would stand by the position that there are no\r\ncommon employees or employees who spend time working for both?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Jordanna's employment is with Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nQ696 Ian C. Lucas: Can I come in on that? That is a very important role, full\r\nstop, but particularly in an analytics company—the person in charge who\r\nis lawfully responsible to the Information Commissioner.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: There is a misunderstanding. She is not the person in\r\ncharge. Ultimately, the CEO is in charge and our data compliance team is\r\nin charge. She is simply the liaison who passes messages between the\r\ntwo bodies.\r\n\r\nQ697 Christian Matheson: What is the difference between owning the data\r\nand processing it?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In the UK, if we were to undertake work for a big\r\ncorporate, their data would be owned by them and they would always be\r\nthe data controller. They would have control and responsibility for their\r\ndata. They could bring us in to work on their data, but we would never\r\ntake receipt of that data and we would never own that data. We would\r\nsimply come in and perform analytic function on that data. Their data\r\nwould remain their data.\r\n\r\nQ698 Rebecca Pow: This is just a small point related to data. I believe I asked\r\nyou whether you gathered the data from Facebook and whether you were\r\nusing all that information. I think you said you did some surveys. Could\r\nyou expand a bit more on what those surveys are, what you are asking\r\npeople and how you are gathering the data? Do you keep that data on\r\nsurveys carried out on Facebook or does Facebook keep it?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I cannot speak to Facebook, but as far as I am aware\r\nthe process works a bit like an opinion survey. If I want to find out how\r\nmany people prefer red cars or yellow cars, I can post that question on\r\nFacebook and people can agree. They can opt in to answer a survey and\r\nthey give their consent and they say, \"I prefer a yellow car\" and then we\r\ncan collect that data. That is no different to running a telephone poll or a\r\ndigital poll or a mail poll or any other form of poll. It is just a platform\r\nthat allows you to engage with communities.\r\n\r\nQ699 Rebecca Pow: Are they a big part of your data-gathering service?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: When we work for brands, whether it is in the UK or in\r\nthe US or elsewhere, we often feel the need to probe their customers and\r\nfind out what they think about particular products or services. We might\r\nuse Facebook as a means to engage with the general public to gather this\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nQ700 Simon Hart: Let me ask a very quick question on the Facebook survey\r\nopt-in option that you were describing. If you are asking somebody what\r\nkind of car they prefer and they opt in, does that facilitate access to other\r\ndata that may be held by Facebook, which is irrelevant to car colour, or is\r\nit only the data you collect on car colour that is relevant? Nothing else\r\nthat is part of the data held by Facebook would be available to you.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: You are absolutely right—no other data. As far as I am\r\naware, Facebook does not share any of its data. It is what is known as a\r\nwalled garden, which keep its data—\r\n\r\nQ701 Simon Hart: People are not in any way accidently giving you consent to\r\naccess data other than that that you specifically asked for.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is correct. People are not giving us consent and\r\nFacebook does not have a mechanism that allows third parties such as us\r\nto access its data on its customers.\r\n\r\nQ702 Simon Hart: Even with its customers' consent.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Even with its customers' consent.\r\n\r\nQ703 Chair: I have taken one of your surveys. It was found through your\r\nwebsite. I think it was a profiling survey that is linked to the OCEAN\r\nmodel. The incentive to take the survey is to understand more about your\r\npsychological profile. When you complete the survey—this is where I\r\nbailed out of the process—it invites you to complete the survey and get\r\nthe information back you want by logging in with your Facebook log-in at\r\nthe end of the process. If someone does that, what data are they\r\nallowing you to share from their Facebook process? What is the purpose\r\nof the Facebook log-in at the end of the survey?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Logging in with Facebook is a fairly common practice in\r\nthe digital realm. It simply saves you the time of putting in your name\r\nand e-mail address and so forth, such that we can then send you that\r\nreport on the survey that you have just taken.\r\n\r\nQ704 Chair: Does that give you the right to access any other data points from\r\nmy Facebook profile?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No, absolutely not. Absolutely not.\r\n\r\nQ705 Paul Farrelly: I just want to clear up two things—I am sure we want to\r\npursue the use of Facebook. You mentioned that SCL Group, or whichever\r\nof the companies it is—you can perhaps be more precise—has X-list\r\naccreditation for work with Government and defence. Can you explain\r\nthat? I have not come across an X list before. Forgive my ignorance.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Not at all. I am sure you are not ignorant at all. SCL is a\r\nbehavioural communications agency that was set up specifically to\r\nservice the government space. We do an awful lot of work in the UK, but\r\nit is principally in the US, working with Government Departments such as\r\nthe DOD, State, Pentagon and so forth. We are trying to use an\r\nunderstanding of group audience behaviour to address often hostile\r\nactions. Specifically, that includes programmes of counter-terrorism and\r\ncounter-radicalisation. We are looking at how we can use an\r\nunderstanding of audiences to address problems in the drug trade, in\r\nchildren and women trafficking, programmes of social change,\r\nGovernment information programmes, a huge number of health\r\nprogrammes—trying to understand how we can encourage people to live\r\nmore healthy lives.\r\n\r\nQ706 Paul Farrelly: Is this all in the US, not in the UK?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It is in the US, the UK and globally. Obviously, the US is\r\na larger market for this kind of work.\r\n\r\nQ707 Paul Farrelly: Are all the various SCL entities involved in this?\r\nAlexander Nix: That is correct.\r\n\r\nQ708 Paul Farrelly: What does SCL stand for?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Historically, going back some 14 or 15 years, it stood for\r\nStrategic Communication Laboratories. It has been abbreviated now.\r\n\r\nQ709 Paul Farrelly: One more loose end. To Rebecca Pow's question about\r\nFacebook, where she said that with a certain number of likes you could\r\nknow someone better than this, this or this, you attributed that to some\r\nprofessor somewhere.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I do not think I attributed to anyone by name.\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: No, you said it was something that had been written by a\r\nprofessor.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think I said by an academic, but that is my\r\nunderstanding, yes.\r\n\r\nQ710 Paul Farrelly: You said that yourself in a speech to the fabulously titled\r\nOnline Marketing Rockstars conference in 2017. You made those claims\r\nabout Cambridge Analytica's capability.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Could you read that out, please?\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: You claimed, \"With 10 Facebook likes, Cambridge\r\nAnalytica can predict an individual's behaviour better than their work\r\ncolleague might. They only need 70 to make\"—that is you—\"behavioural\r\npredictions better than a friend, 150 to understand a voter better than\r\ntheir parents\". With 300 likes you claimed your organisation can, \"predict\r\na person's actions, thoughts and feelings better than their spouse\".\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Those are not my words. I am familiar with that text.\r\nThat was the text that your colleague Rebecca was quoting from but\r\nthose were not Cambridge's words. That was a statement that was made\r\nby an academic who spent a number of years, I believe at Stanford\r\nUniversity, looking into this area. That was his work, and that was his\r\nstatement. I do not know why that has been attributed to Cambridge.\r\n\r\nQ711 Paul Farrelly: You have not made those claims on Cambridge\r\nAnalytica—\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is not my statement, period.\r\n\r\nQ712 Paul Farrelly: Did you quote it?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No, I did not quote it. I have never memorised those\r\nstatistics in order to include them in a quotation.\r\n\r\nQ713 Ian C. Lucas: Is Cambridge Analytica a Facebook developer?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No.\r\n\r\nQ714 Ian C. Lucas: What is your relationship with Facebook?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We are a client of Facebook. We purchase advertising\r\nthrough Facebook, as every other digital agency does.\r\n\r\nQ715 Chair: Mr Nix, I would like to clarify one or two things that you have\r\nsaid, and I have one or two things about Facebook before we move on to\r\nother topics. You were asked earlier about Jordanna Zetter's dual role\r\nworking with SCL and with Cambridge Analytica. Was that dual role\r\ncreated in response to the inquiries from the Information Commissioner\r\n\r\nor was she working on that dual role before those inquiries were made to\r\nyour company?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: As far as I am aware—and I would be pleased to circle\r\nback to the Committee to confirm this—Jordanna Zetter is employed by\r\nour office in London to work for Cambridge Analytica. She has no formal\r\nrole with SCL Group, which is based out of Arlington, Virginia, in the\r\nUnited States. I think, as far as I am aware, she has never even visited\r\nthose offices and has no relationship with them. She was simply asked to\r\nhelp with the ICO's inquiries into data and data protection. She kindly\r\nagreed to act as a liaison in that respect. Should they have any\r\nquestions—I am not sure that they do or did, but again I would need to\r\nconfirm that for you—for SCL in the United States, she would pass them\r\non and be the conduit of that, simply because they do not have a\r\nrelationship with those people. It is purely an administrative role. She is\r\nnot a senior member of staff.\r\n\r\nQ716 Chair: If you were able to confirm that in writing we would be grateful\r\nfor that, and also whether that liaison role was in place before the\r\nInformation Commissioner's investigation commenced.\r\n\r\nMoving on to Facebook, in response to other questions you drew a\r\ndistinction between being a data controller and a data processor. Could\r\nyou explain a little bit more to us about that distinction between those\r\ntwo roles?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Again, this is certainly not my area of expertise. I run\r\nthe leadership team, not the data compliance team. My understanding of\r\nhow this works in the United Kingdom is that the brands that we work\r\nwith remain the controllers of their own data. That is, if you are a large\r\nretail brand and you have collected a lot of data on consumers, you own\r\nand are responsible for that data and for looking after it and securitising\r\nit and protecting it and all the regulation that governs it. These brands\r\nare allowed to engage with companies and agencies such as Cambridge\r\nAnalytica in order to help them to process or model this data. We perform\r\nan analytic function as a subcontractor or as a contractor on this data.\r\nWe do that work for them, often on their own servers within their own\r\ndata ecosystem and then we leave. We do not control that data, and we\r\ndo not have a copy of that data.\r\n\r\nQ717 Chair: You said in your letter to me that, \"Cambridge Analytica does not\r\ngather\" data from Facebook.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: From Facebook?\r\n\r\nChair: Yes.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is correct.\r\n\r\nQ718 Chair: The actual quote from the letter is: \"On 8 February 2018 Mr\r\nMatheson implied that Cambridge Analytica 'gathers data from users on\r\nFacebook.' Cambridge Analytica does not gather such data.\" But from\r\nwhat you said you do, do you not, through the surveys?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes, I think I can see what has happened here. What we\r\nwere trying to say in our letter is that we do not gather Facebook data\r\nfrom Facebook users. We can use Facebook as an instrument to go out\r\nand run large-scale surveys of the users, but we do not gather Facebook\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nQ719 Chair: By that do you mean that you do not have access to data that is\r\nowned by Facebook?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Exactly.\r\n\r\nQ720 Chair: You acquire data from Facebook users through them engaging\r\nwith surveys and other things.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Exactly right.\r\n\r\nQ721 Chair: Is your engagement, either directly or through any associate\r\ncompanies you may have, just through the placing of surveys or are\r\nthere other tools or games or things that are on Facebook that you use to\r\ngather data from Facebook users?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No, simply through surveys.\r\n\r\nQ722 Chair: We referenced earlier the presentation you gave at the Concordia\r\nConference in 2016 about your work for the Ted Cruz campaign. Were\r\nyou hired to work for Donald Trump on the basis of your work with Ted\r\nCruz? I imagine you could not have been working for two candidates in\r\nthe same race, so did you start—\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Actually we were working for two candidates in the\r\nprimaries. We were working for Dr Ben Carson's campaign and for Ted\r\nCruz's campaign, and we were seeking to work for Donald Trump's\r\ncampaign throughout the primaries as well but the Trump campaign did\r\nnot wish to engage with us other than on an exclusive basis. We had two\r\nclients who we were well established with and we were not willing to give\r\nthose up, so we said to the Trump campaign that, \"In the event that you\r\nwin the primary let's reopen the discussions that we started almost a\r\nyear beforehand\".\r\n\r\nQ723 Chair: The work that you did for the Trump campaign was obviously after\r\nTed Cruz's campaign had ended. Is that right?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Immediately after Trump won the primary—Cruz coming\r\nto second to him—we reopened a dialogue with the Trump campaign\r\nabout how we could take all the technology that we developed, largely for\r\nthe Cruz campaign, and pivot it across to Trump to give him the same or\r\nsimilar capability.\r\n\r\nQ724 Chair: Is that what you did?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is exactly what we did.\r\n\r\nQ725 Chair: In your presentation you said that the Cruz campaign relied on a\r\nsort of tripartite strategy where the campaigns were based on\r\nunderstanding behavioural communications, which is where the OCEAN\r\n\r\nsurvey and psychological profiling comes in, data analytics-data from\r\nmultiple sources where it is available—and then ad data to place the\r\nmessaging. Is that the same approach you used for Donald Trump's\r\ncampaign?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We would have liked it to have been, but it was not the\r\nsame approach, simply because when we joined the Trump campaign we\r\nhad about five and a half months before polling to build or re-engender\r\nthe entire analytics capability that Clinton's team had and that we had\r\nbeen giving to Cruz. We simply did not have the time and resources to be\r\nable to go into the same depth of services that we provided to the Cruz\r\ncampaign, which we had been working on for very many more months. It\r\nwas a very extended and protracted programme. We made the decision\r\nto focus on the data and analytics elements of the campaign and the\r\ntech, digital and data-driven TV elements of the campaign. We did not\r\nhave time to bake in or to incorporate the behavioural approach, the\r\npsychographics that we had used on the Cruz campaign.\r\n\r\nQ726 Chair: Why not? You said that the psychographic information is based on\r\nsurveys you have done, which means you believe you have an accurate\r\nmodel for understanding every voter in America. Presumably that\r\ndatabase could be migrated to support other campaigns as well. It is not\r\ndata specific to a particular campaign, is it? It is generic profiling of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes, but then you have to take these data and\r\ncontextualise them into the campaign that you are working on.\r\nEverything that we did for Cruz in that regard was centric around Cruz.\r\nWe would have to then replicate that for Trump and that would have just\r\nbeen the most enormous piece of work.\r\n\r\nQ727 Chair: In that case, I don't understand why you were hired. You have\r\nmade it quite clear in your presentation on your work for Ted Cruz that\r\nyour model is based on the combination of these different elements. The\r\nad data is about message targeting—the media placement bit of it—but\r\nthe smart bit is the merging of psychological profiling and data analytics.\r\nIn fact, what you do here in this country is based on that too. That seems\r\nto be your USP. Why would none of that psychological profiling have been\r\nused to augment the data in the Trump campaign when that is the way\r\nyou work?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: As I said before, the reason it was not used was because\r\nwe simply did not have the time and resources to include it. If we had\r\nhad that opportunity, we would have. We did not and we are just trying\r\nto be transparent about that fact. To say that the smart bit is simply that\r\nwould be doing an injustice to the 40 or so PhD data scientists who spent\r\n100 hours a week for five months crunching data and numbers in order\r\nto develop the very accurate and insightful models that they did for the\r\nTrump campaign.\r\n\r\nQ728 Chair: The way you sold yourself and what your company did was based\r\non the combination of these elements together. If I was someone in the\r\nroom that day—the way these conferences work is that you are\r\n\r\neffectively there pitching yourself and your company in the hope of\r\nwinning new business and new clients on the back of it. You have a very\r\nclear model and it is quite interesting that one of the three supports of\r\nthat stall has been taken away to go and work on another high profile\r\ncampaign. It seems very strange.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: You can only provide a client, whether it is political or\r\nbrand, with the services that you are able to deliver within the constraints\r\nof the project timelines that you are presented with. You are absolutely\r\ncorrect that, in an ideal world, not only would we have liked to have\r\ndelivered the services that I spoke about in that presentation but many\r\nother services that we have developed across the engagement space, as\r\ndigital and television in particular, but we simply did not have time.\r\nUnfortunately, unlike running a brand campaign where you are selling\r\nautomotives or toothpaste or something where you don't have the same\r\ntime pressures, we have a finite amount of time. You have to choose\r\nwhich technologies in your arsenal are going to be the most important\r\nand that can be deployed most effectively, and we made a decision.\r\n\r\nQ729 Chair: In that presentation I think there is a slide on data analytics\r\nwhere you describe that data is sourced from multiple sources and any\r\nmarketing company will know that there are companies that specialise in\r\ndata analytics to analyse consumer behaviour. I think on your chart you\r\nhad logos of different companies. I think Experian was one and Nielsen\r\nwas one. You had Facebook on there as well. Again, just to confirm on\r\nthis, is that because you are highlighting the fact that you can gather\r\ndata from Facebook?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Collect data through Facebook—that is exactly right,\r\nyes.\r\n\r\nQ730 Chair: Does any of your data comes from Global Science Research\r\ncompany?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: GSR?\r\n\r\nChair: Yes.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research\r\nfor us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the\r\nanswer is no.\r\n\r\nQ731 Chair: They have not supplied you with data or information?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No.\r\n\r\nQ732 Chair: Your datasets are not based with information you have received\r\nfrom them?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No.\r\n\r\nChair: At all?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: At all.\r\n\r\nQ733 Ian C. Lucas: Can I go back to an answer I think you gave earlier? I just\r\n\r\nwant you to confirm something. Did you say that you had never worked\r\non any political campaigns in the UK?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I said that I personally had not been involved in any\r\npolitical campaigns in the UK. I have been with the company for about 14\r\nyears and, as far as I am aware, in the last 14 years we have never\r\nworked on any campaigns in the UK.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: That is Cambridge Analytica and—\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Cambridge Analytica was only formed in 2012, so this\r\nwould have been a company that I worked for prior to forming Cambridge\r\nAnalytica, which was called SCL.\r\n\r\nQ734 Ian C. Lucas: By political campaigns, that means general elections.\r\nWhat about for candidate elections for political parties within the UK?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Again, as far as I am aware, since I have been in the\r\ncompany we have never worked—we don't seek to work in the UK, for\r\nthe reasons I discussed earlier. We don't see the UK as a commercial\r\nmarket of interest for SCL or—\r\n\r\nQ735 Ian C. Lucas: That really puzzles me because there are lots of other\r\nbusinesses that might do work for different political organisations within\r\nthe advertising sector or within the information sector. Why is it that you\r\nare so involved in politics in the US but you are not involved in the UK?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think I have addressed this already but let me explain\r\nit again for you. First, we only entered the US market in 2012. We have\r\nbeen running election campaigns since 1994. We take on a number of\r\nnational elections every year. That could be three, four, five, six, seven\r\nelections across the world in every single year for prime ministers and\r\npresidents. That could be in Asia, Latin America, Europe, Africa or\r\nbeyond. We entered the US market relatively recently. We saw a\r\ncommercial opportunity to bring some of the technologies that we had\r\ndeveloped to that market, particularly to help with Republican politics\r\nbecause they were losing the tech arms race, if you like, to the\r\nDemocrats and that is where the opportunity existed. We have no more\r\ninterest in servicing the US political market than we do helping political\r\nparties in Africa or Asia. Specifically in regards to the UK, as I said\r\nbefore, originally we were a British company with most of our staff based\r\nin the UK, and we felt that it would be unfair on our staff for senior\r\nmanagement to make a decision about which political party the company\r\nsupported, especially if that was at odds with the political views of our\r\nemployees, so we did not want to put them in that awkward position.\r\n\r\nQ736 Ian C. Lucas: That is very thoughtful, because lots of other businesses\r\ndon't do that in the UK. Could you tell me who your clients are in the UK?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We work for brands in the UK. Although the current\r\nimpression is that we are a political consultancy, I have tried to explain to\r\nthis Committee that we are not a political consultancy. We are a\r\ntechnology-driven marketing firm, and the majority of our business is in\r\nthe brand space. We work for big and small brands, trying to help them\r\n\r\nmarket and sell their products and services to consumers around the\r\nworld. We also have a government and defence division, which I am very\r\nproud of and which does enormously important work in saving lives all\r\nover the world in campaigns about issues that really matter. We have a\r\npolitical division, but our political division is only, say, 20% or 25% of our\r\nentire business.\r\n\r\nQ737 Ian C. Lucas: Given your thoughtful approach with your employees\r\nabout not getting involved in political campaigns, what led you to start to\r\ndiscuss with Leave.EU about getting involved in probably the most\r\ncontentious political campaign in British history?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It was only an exploratory discussion and, as I have said\r\nto the Committee already, we have these sorts of discussions with all\r\nparties in the UK. Without exception, every single party has approached\r\nus, and every single party has asked about our services. We have had\r\nthese discussions. Some of them have been more protracted than others\r\nand we have never engaged with anyone—not on my watch—but it does\r\nnot mean we are not interested to understand more about their needs\r\nand concerns, to understand more about the technology they are\r\nembracing and to see what the market is like. This was an example of\r\nthat. In the end the decision was made not to move forward.\r\n\r\nQ738 Ian C. Lucas: You are not a partisan political outfit.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I don't think we would be particularly good at our job if\r\nwe were partisan. We try to be objective. We try to walk into a country\r\nand service our clients with the best, most cutting edge technology and\r\nmethodologies available for communications and campaigning.\r\n\r\nQ739 Ian C. Lucas: Why was Steve Bannon on your board?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Steve Bannon was on our board to help a British\r\ncompany to understand a new market that it was trying to penetrate. I\r\ncan't think of many people who would be better to help a company enter\r\na market, particularly into the Republican space, than somebody who had\r\nextensive experience of the commercial and business landscape through\r\nhis time at Goldman Sachs and the like, who understood the media\r\nlandscape through other experiences, and who also had a very attuned\r\npolitical knowledge.\r\n\r\nQ740 Ian C. Lucas: I can't think of anyone who is a more partisan political\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I can't speak to your—\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Okay, but it does not sit easily with the fact that you are\r\nnon-partisan in one country but you are massively partisan in another.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In the United States, the practice is not to switch sides.\r\nYou either work for the Republicans or you work for the Democrats. You\r\ndon't do one election for one and then change sides. That is how the\r\nconvention is. In other countries, we always give our previous clients first\r\nbite and first sight of our services, but if for any reason they do not wish\r\n\r\nto engage with us, we are at liberty to go and work for opposition parties\r\nand sell our services to them.\r\n\r\nQ741 Chair: You might be interested to know, Mr Nix, that various people are\r\nwatching the evidence session. It is being broadcast and people are\r\ntweeting about it. Julian Assange has tweeted about it, sharing a link to\r\nthe session where people can watch it. Has Cambridge Analytica or any of\r\nits associate companies ever worked on campaigns to distribute\r\ninformation that has been sourced from WikiLeaks?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We have no relationship with WikiLeaks. We have never\r\nspoken to anyone at WikiLeaks. We have never done any business with\r\nWikiLeaks. We have no relationship with them, period.\r\n\r\nQ742 Chair: That was not quite the question I asked, which was whether you\r\nhad ever been involved in advising on or organising campaigns to\r\ndistribute information that has been sourced from WikiLeaks.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We have never been involved in organising or advising\r\non campaigns that distribute data or information from WikiLeaks.\r\n\r\nQ743 Chair: Arron Banks has also been following the session and tweeting\r\nabout it. He has invited himself to come and give evidence to the\r\nCommittee, which we might well take him up on—Mr Lucas suggested\r\nthat earlier on. If Mr Banks is still watching, if he wants to keep his diary\r\nfree over the next couple of weeks, we may well be in touch. What he\r\nsays in his tweet about your negotiations—this potential marriage or\r\ncourtship that failed—is that, \"CA wanted a fee of £1m to start work &\r\nthen said they would raise £6m in the states. We declined the offer\r\nbecause it was illegal.\" Is what he is saying correct?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Absolutely incorrect.\r\n\r\nQ744 Chair: That is the second time he has lied, according to you.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Mr Banks is at liberty to say whatever he likes, but I\r\ndon't have to agree with it.\r\n\r\nQ745 Chair: What he has said in that message is totally untrue?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is totally untrue.\r\n\r\nQ746 Simon Hart: I have a quick question on the attitude to your staff and not\r\nwishing to put them in a difficult position when it comes to choosing\r\ncampaigns. Do you apply the same principle to which brands you choose\r\nto represent? Do your staff have a say? They may feel more comfortable\r\nwith some brands than others. Do you consult them over that?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We always give our staff a choice about which projects\r\nthey would like to work on. If anyone for any reason does not feel\r\ncomfortable working on a particular brand, we are happy to offer them\r\nthe opportunity to work on a different brand. If, for instance—and I keep\r\nusing the example—you don't believe that the automotive industry is\r\nnecessarily good for the environment, you do not have to work on it. You\r\ncan go and work on selling bicycles.\r\n\r\nQ747 Simon Hart: Likewise, UK employees working on the Trump campaign\r\ncould also choose—\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: All our employees have that opportunity.\r\n\r\nQ748 Chair: I wanted to ask you something about data that I meant to ask you\r\nabout earlier. You gather data from various sources, including from\r\nFacebook through the survey tools you have on the platform. Do you\r\nretain that data and information unless you receive a request to hand it\r\nback or to destroy it?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In a country like the United States, we retain that data.\r\nSome of that data is purchased and some of that data is licensed, so then\r\nyou need to either return it or delete it or refresh it.\r\n\r\nQ749 Chair: When you talk about data being purchased, who are the people\r\nyou have purchased it from in that case?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It is possible to go out and purchase commercially\r\navailable datasets. There are people who make a living from selling data\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nQ750 Chair: Could you give us an example of a company?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: This would be people who collect data off their\r\ncustomers, for instance.\r\n\r\nQ751 Chair: Given that Facebook is such a major platform, would that include\r\ncustomer Facebook data that has been gathered by other people that you\r\ncan buy?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I don't know. My understanding—you would have to\r\nspeak to Facebook and I know you have spoken to Facebook—is that they\r\ndo not share any of their data, and it would be bad for their business\r\nmodel, I assume, if they did.\r\n\r\nQ752 Chair: Yes. That is certainly what they said to us in their evidence\r\nsession. You would hold data that you have acquired on people in\r\nAmerica in particular. That data would be used in different campaigns.\r\nYou might gather that data as part of one piece of work you are doing for\r\none client, and you might even use that data in another campaign if it\r\nwas relevant to that campaign.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes. At a high level, yes, but it depends on the data\r\nagreement that is signed with the person that you acquire or license that\r\ndata from. Different datasets might have different licensing regulations.\r\n\r\nQ753 Chair: In that presentation, you cited the Iowa caucus as being a\r\ncampaign you have worked on. Could data that you used working for Ted\r\nCruz in Iowa have been used in the Trump campaign as well?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Hypothetically, it could have been, yes.\r\n\r\nQ754 Chair: We have talked a lot about profiling, both psychologically and\r\nthrough data analysis. The third pillar of your presentation was about ad\r\ndata and ad placement. Do you advise clients not just on how to reach\r\n\r\npeople and what message they should see, but also how frequently they\r\nneed to be contacted about a message in order for it to be persuasive?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes, we do.\r\n\r\nQ755 Chair: Do you advise on the architecture for distributing that information\r\nas well? We have taken a lot of evidence about networks of accounts on\r\nFacebook and Twitter in particular that are used and set up to reach\r\naudiences and target audiences with information. Would you advise\r\npeople on how those should be set up?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Do you mean physical architecture or are you talking\r\nabout the balance between different channels and how they are\r\nweighted?\r\n\r\nChair: I suppose it is a combination of those things. If you are saying\r\nthat you give advice on how frequently someone needs to see a message\r\nand, let's say, that Facebook is going to be one of the chosen media in\r\norder for that message to be seen, do you advise on how that message\r\nshould be delivered by Facebook? You could just set up a Facebook page\r\nwith some information on, you could use advertising to supplement the\r\nreach of that, or you could use the interaction of other accounts and\r\nother pages to bring audiences to that page. Is that the sort of advice\r\nyou give clients as part of advising them on not just what they should\r\nsay, but how frequently they need to say it?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It is either the advice that we would give them or the\r\nwork that we would undertake on their behalf.\r\n\r\nQ756 Chair: We have looked at the role of bot accounts, in particular on\r\nTwitter. Is that something that you would advise clients on, how to set up\r\nnetworks of bot accounts to augment messages and make sure that\r\npeople see them frequently?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Absolutely not. That is not something we engage with. It\r\nis not something that we would engage with. It goes against everything\r\nthat we are trying to achieve. What we are trying to do is make sure that\r\nthe most relevant messages hit the right audiences. The idea that you\r\ncould use bot accounts to spread messages is contrary to everything we\r\nare set up to do. That goes back to the area of blanket advertising and\r\nspamming people with irrelevant information. That is not what we do.\r\n\r\nQ757 Chair: Twitter were very clear when they gave evidence to us that bot\r\naccounts can be used for good and bad. There is a bot account in my\r\nconstituency that tweets the weather every day, which is a perfectly\r\nharmless service that someone is providing. The question is what they\r\nare for, but clearly any one of these accounts is used to target\r\ninformation at people you want to receive it. It is a targeting tool, not\r\njust a broadcasting tool. Is that the sort of advice you give people on how\r\nto use these networks of accounts in order to reach the right people?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No, it is not. It really isn't, because there would be no\r\nneed to invest in our services if that was the implementation or the\r\nengagement process that you were seeking to use. What we are trying to\r\n\r\ndo is get away from everything that could be construed as mass\r\ncommunication, spamming or large-scale media engagement. We are\r\ntrying to make our communications more personal—really personal. We\r\nare trying to build the individual relationship between the brands and\r\ntheir customers. I agree with you that bots can be used for good, but it is\r\ngenerally not a technology that aligns with what we have been set up to\r\ndo and what we have been doing for the last 10 years.\r\n\r\nQ758 Chair: If you had a client and you were advising them on how to reach\r\ntheir audience and the frequency with which they need to reach their\r\naudience with a message, and Twitter and Facebook were the chosen\r\nplatforms through which that communication would take place, how\r\nwould you go about planning and developing that campaign and\r\ndelivering it?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: What we are trying to do is look at an audience and\r\nsegment that audience into as many different groups as possible such\r\nthat we can begin to identify what each of those subgroups in the target\r\naudience care about most in relation to a specific product or service or,\r\nindeed, political candidate or campaign. Then we start to tailor messaging\r\nthat can be made most relevant to the concerns, issues, hopes and fears\r\nof those particular people, so that we can give them the facts of the\r\nmatter in the most relevant and personal way. It is about breaking\r\nmessages down into multiple messages and then nuancing them to make\r\nthem more relevant.\r\n\r\nQ759 Chair: I understand the message creation; I am asking about the\r\nmessage delivery. How do you deliver the message to somebody with the\r\nmedia that you use?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In the instance of Facebook, we are able to take these\r\noffline segments, and we can match them to cookies and target the\r\nspecific adverts that we have made for that group of people, whether it is\r\n100 people or 100,000 people, and serve that message to them through\r\ntheir cookies.\r\n\r\nQ760 Chair: Through cookies on any site?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: On Facebook or any other platform.\r\n\r\nQ761 Chair: Given that Facebook is a closed platform, how do you do that? Do\r\nyou go to Facebook and say, as other advertisers would do, \"We have got\r\nthis campaign. We want to target Facebook users. This is the profile of\r\nthe people we want to target\"?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Exactly that. It is an anonymised match based on a\r\ntarget profile that we have developed through our data analytics.\r\n\r\nQ762 Chair: Then you just pay Facebook in the ordinary way for targeting\r\nthose people?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Exactly that.\r\n\r\nQ763 Chair: Do you gather data that enables you to plan campaigns that might\r\nbe targeted at people who have certain religious beliefs or come from a\r\n\r\ncertain ethnic background or hold certain political opinions?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In our campaigns we are trying to get away from\r\ndemographics. We are trying to look at people based on their\r\nfundamental drivers and, in the case of politics, this is about who is likely\r\nto be supporting a Republican versus a Democrat and what issues are\r\nmost relevant to those audiences. I don't think that targeting in the way\r\nthat you have implied is going to help us.\r\n\r\nQ764 Chair: If someone came along and said, \"I want to run a campaign that\r\nis going to be particularly relevant to people that I think are voting\r\nRepublican but have very strong religious beliefs\", would you say, \"We\r\ncan create that campaign for you because we not only understand\r\npeople's political motivations but we also can identify people with strong\r\nreligious beliefs because of the profiling we have done on them\"?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think that would depend very much on the data that\r\nwe have access to or have already gathered. I would not be able to\r\nanswer that question specifically, but hypothetically it would be possible if\r\nyou had enough data, say on evangelical Christians in America, to have a\r\nlook at that audience and see if there is a correlation between that and\r\nsome political agenda.\r\n\r\nQ765 Chair: These sorts of data are gathered that theoretically makes it\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It certainly is not gathered by us, but obviously there\r\nare very large church organisations and religious organisations that might\r\nhave access to these types of data.\r\n\r\nQ766 Chair: We have talked a lot about America and I appreciate the data laws\r\nin America are different and, in some ways, I guess that makes what you\r\ndo easier in America than it does in the UK. What steps do you take as a\r\ncompany to make sure that you are always fully compliant with UK data\r\nprotection laws?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Data is the core of our business and so we take data\r\nincredibly seriously. We have an in-house data compliance team who are\r\nworking continually with the legislators not only to help understand the\r\nlaws, but to help inform on data legislation and how it could be updated\r\nand kept forward. We anonymise and encrypt all data that we receive\r\nfrom clients, and we would like to believe that we are very much at the\r\ncutting edge of the technologies behind both of those services. We do not\r\nstore data locally on devices in order to mitigate the possibility of data\r\nbreaches and so forth. Internally, we have our policies on how we treat\r\ndata and so forth. It is something that we have given a great deal of\r\nconsideration to and something we take incredibly seriously.\r\n\r\nQ767 Chair: When you say you are at the cutting edge of this industry and the\r\nway you use that data is part of being at the cutting edge of that, what\r\nsort of data processing do you do? You say you are receiving raw data\r\nbut then you are organising it in some way to make it more relevant. Can\r\nyou explain a bit more about how that process works? What would you\r\nconsider to be an ethical use of that data being processed in such a way?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Certainly. We are not a data miner or a company like\r\nthat. We are a data analytics company, so our job is to turn data into\r\ninsight—to take very large datasets and try to identify patterns in that\r\ndata and to use the data to make predictions about audiences. We are\r\njust trying to run algorithms on the data to try to find meaning in it.\r\n\r\nQ768 Chair: Is it fair to say that there would be many people who have given\r\ntheir data to you who are not aware that their data is being used in this\r\nway and that they could be targeted in a way that they would never have\r\nexpected, because they do not understand that that is how their data can\r\nbe not only gathered but processed and then used to support other\r\ncampaigns?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: There are several answers to that. The first answer is\r\nthat these are not particularly intrusive data. This is not like someone has\r\ngiven up their health data or their financial data or their private data.\r\nThese data are commercially available, as I have said. These are data on\r\nyour consumer and lifestyle habits: what car you drive, what magazines\r\nyou read, whether you have Weetabix for breakfast and the like. I think\r\nmost people understand that there is a reciprocity with large brands\r\nwhereby they agree, for instance, to receive a loyalty card and get\r\ndiscounts and offers on products and services from that company. Most\r\npeople understand that their data is being taken in return to help that\r\nbrand to drive its marketing. Let's say that large UK supermarkets—Tesco\r\nor Sainsbury's—all have these types of things. People are not naive. They\r\nunderstand that reciprocity and they say, \"If people find out whether I\r\nbuy a loaf of bread and a pint of milk and I get 10% discount off, that is\r\na fair trade-off\".\r\n\r\nWhat is this going to look like in the future? I think that the landscape is\r\nchanging, clearly with GDPR coming in. What we are seeing is that people\r\nare going to want to have more sovereignty over their data and are going\r\nto want to see a greater reciprocity of how their data is used and greater\r\ncontrol. I think that is very healthy and something that we are investing\r\nvery heavily in and look forward to. It is going to improve the data\r\nlandscape, improve how data can be used where people say, \"Okay, I\r\nrecognise that my data has a value and why should other companies\r\nsimply benefit from that? Why should I not be a participant in receiving\r\nsome of that remuneration?\"\r\n\r\nQ769 Chair: Do you not see there is a big difference here between saying, \"I\r\nunderstand that you like a particular brand of car and, therefore, I am\r\ngoing to send you information about other brands of car that are similar\r\nand you might be interested in because we know you like a certain type\r\nof car\"—which I think people understand as it has been a marketing\r\ntechnique or a direct marketing technique for very many years—and\r\nsaying, \"Because of the information I have gathered about you, I know\r\nhow to make you frightened\"? Isn't that a very different proposition?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: These are only opinions we are looking at. You can go\r\nand speak to people yourselves and you can form an opinion based on\r\nthose conversations about what might be the most relevant information\r\n\r\nto them. All we are doing is looking at data and making our own personal\r\nopinion about what we think is going to be important insights from that\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nQ770 Ian C. Lucas: Can you help me a little with these surveys that elicit\r\ninformation from the people who fill them in? I have filled in a couple of\r\nthese surveys online over the years but to my knowledge I have never\r\nfilled in a Cambridge Analytica survey. When you are eliciting\r\ninformation, what does it look like on a platform? What does it look like\r\non a Facebook platform?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It might start with basic demographic information: your\r\nname, your age, your gender.\r\n\r\nQ771 Ian C. Lucas: Does it say who is asking?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That will obviously depend—I am sure you have seen an\r\nopinion survey in your life. They are all fairly similar. They follow a fairly\r\nstandard structure, which is generally establishing who you are speaking\r\nto and then asks you some questions.\r\n\r\nQ772 Ian C. Lucas: Does it say it is from Cambridge Analytica? Would you\r\never present a survey on Facebook as saying, \"This is a Cambridge\r\nAnalytica survey. Please give us this information\"?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We have done and we do, but it depends what the\r\npurpose of the survey is.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: I have never had one.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think we rolled out 350,000 to 400,000 surveys a\r\nmonth for the Trump campaign in the United States over a five-month\r\nperiod. These were being done on and behalf of the Trump campaign and\r\nthat was the label of the survey. The fact that we were helping them to\r\ngather these data was less relevant.\r\n\r\nQ773 Ian C. Lucas: I think it is important that people know who is asking. You\r\nhave just said that was for the Trump campaign, and I think that is\r\nentirely legitimate and fair, but when individuals fill in a survey, do you\r\nthink they should be told who is the client, who is the person asking them\r\nand where the data is going?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I can see no reason to obfuscate that truth. These are\r\nentirely voluntary surveys. If someone knocks at your door and says,\r\n\"Could you fill out a survey?\" you don't have to undertake that. They\r\nmight say, \"Who is this for?\" and you say it is for cancer research.\r\n\r\nQ774 Ian C. Lucas: I am not sure that people understand what their data is\r\nbeing used for.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think I would disagree with that. Most people\r\nunderstand that data is being gathered. You are not filling in a survey\r\nsimply for your own entertainment. I think they do understand that the\r\ncompanies that are collecting this data must be using it for something.\r\n\r\nQ775 Ian C. Lucas: When you obtain that data for a particular client, do you\r\nretain that data as Cambridge Analytica and then use that as a resource\r\nfor other clients? Is that what you do?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: As I have already mentioned to your colleague, that\r\ndepends entirely on the relationship that we have with the client and also\r\nthe territory that we are operating in and what the legislation is. It is\r\ncase by case.\r\n\r\nQ776 Ian C. Lucas: Let's talk about the UK. If you collect data for an individual\r\nclient as Cambridge Analytica, do you use that data for another client?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: The client data that we collect for clients in the UK\r\nbelongs to the clients, who are ultimately the data controllers. We are\r\njust processing or, in this case, collecting, which is part of the processing\r\nfunction for these clients.\r\n\r\nQ777 Ian C. Lucas: In those circumstances, you never collect data yourselves\r\nas Cambridge Analytica? You only collect it for clients?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In those circumstances, yes.\r\n\r\nQ778 Ian C. Lucas: But you do collect data for yourselves sometimes?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: For instance, Mr Collins filled out a survey on our\r\nwebsite, or nearly filled it out. That would be data we are collecting for\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nQ779 Ian C. Lucas: That is very clear, but within the UK you would need the\r\nconsent of the individual who is supplying you with the information in\r\norder to transfer it to another client.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is correct.\r\n\r\nQ780 Ian C. Lucas: But that would not apply in the United States.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Again, it might apply. Some customers might say\r\nspecifically, \"Our data is our data. Do not share it\" and that comes down\r\nto the discussion you have with them at the time you engage with those\r\nclients about how they want their data treated.\r\n\r\nQ781 Chair: Mr Nix, the purpose of your surveys is to support psychological\r\nprofiling of people, isn't it?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: The purpose of our psychological surveys is to do that\r\nbut, as I just mentioned, we were undertaking up to 400,000 surveys a\r\nmonth for five months. These were not psychological surveys at all.\r\nThese were just political surveys trying to understand what issues were\r\nmost relevant to which audiences and to help us understand our resource\r\nallocation, our targeting, our messaging and so forth. They were nothing\r\nto do with that.\r\n\r\nQ782 Chair: I appreciate the questions are being framed in that way, but the\r\nway the OCEAN process works is to analyse people's answers to different\r\nsorts of questions and, from that, to develop a profile of the sort of\r\nperson they are, the world view they have, what their motivations are,\r\n\r\nwhat makes them happy and what makes them sad.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: The OCEAN methodology was simply one of many\r\nmethodologies that came out of experimental psychology to help\r\nunderstand behaviours. Your Government have an—I am going to get\r\nthis wrong—institute of behavioural science that they use to help\r\nunderstand how to increase people's tax payments or to encourage\r\npeople to reduce smoking and so forth. All they are doing is taking\r\nacademic literature in order to understand audiences in order to increase\r\ncompliance, often for very importance issues.\r\n\r\nQ783 Chair: But if from your surveys you are saying that we know someone is\r\nfrightened of crime and they have concerns about gun use and about\r\nwhether Hillary Clinton is weak on crime, what you are doing is building\r\nup a psychological profile of someone and you are using that data to\r\ntarget them with a message. That is the purpose of these surveys.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: If you can identify that an audience group is frightened\r\nof crime and that is really important to them, you can then share with\r\nthese audiences your candidate's policies on how they intend to tackle\r\ncrime and how they intend to address a major fear of those constituents,\r\nand I think that is really healthy. These people have an identified\r\nproblem—they are frightened of crime—and you are able to say to them,\r\n\"Don't be frightened of crime because look what our candidate is going to\r\ndo. We have set out our policy. This is our position on crime,\" and you\r\nmake sure that that information gets to the people for whom it is a\r\nworry. That has to be good.\r\n\r\nQ784 Chair: You could send a message saying, \"You are right to be frightened\r\nof crime because the other candidate is weak on crime and if they win\r\nyou and your family is in danger\". I think anyone would recognise that as\r\na kind of psychological profiling. You have other layers on it as well, such\r\nas, \"Are you frightened about immigration? Is immigration the cause of\r\ncrime?\" We saw a lot of messaging like that around the referendum\r\ncampaign here as well. That is not just data analytics and people answers\r\nto individual questions; that is using that data to build up a psychological\r\nprofile of individuals and then target them, isn't it?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I can't speak to the UK referendum but—\r\n\r\nChair: It applies to any election or any campaign, and it certainly applies\r\nto the American campaign.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think I have made my position clear, which is that we\r\nare trying to make sure that we can use data to understand what people\r\ncare about and we can seek to address those concerns. If those are fears,\r\nwe can allay those fears by telling audiences how we are going to solve\r\nthose problems and that has to be good.\r\n\r\nQ785 Simon Hart: If you can identify a section of the audience that is\r\nexpressing some concerns, perhaps about immigration or gun crime or\r\nwhatever it is, are you arguing that what you do is help to allay those\r\nfears or is it the accusation that has been made that all you do is\r\noxygenate those fears in order to suit the guy who is paying you the big\r\n\r\nfee? Which of those accusations is correct? You are making it sound like\r\nyou are doing a public service.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We are doing a service to our client. Our job as a\r\ncampaign consultancy is to make sure that we provide the best\r\ncommunication technologies and methodologies in order to allow our\r\nclients to get their messages across.\r\n\r\nQ786 Simon Hart: I am sorry, I did not put it very clearly earlier on. Is that\r\nthe same thing as when you identify an area where fear may be a factor?\r\nAre you saying that you do not contribute to exacerbating that fear, you\r\ndo not then develop messages that make people perhaps more fearful\r\nthan they previously were, rather than less fearful?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think you need to look at campaigning over the last\r\n100 years. Negative campaigning is a part of every campaign regardless\r\nof the technologies that are being embraced at any given time. The\r\nability for one candidate to stand up and say, \"You know what, under this\r\nparticular candidate or political party the country is going to be worse off.\r\nYou are going to have less money in your pocket, you are going to have\r\nmore crime,\" is just an integral part of the political process.\r\n\r\nQ787 Simon Hart: That is true, but they are the candidates, they are the\r\nname on the ballot paper.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: And their campaign teams are doing exactly the same\r\nand you well know that, as does everyone in this room. Extolling the\r\nvirtues of your candidate and the weaknesses of your opposition is a fair\r\npractice in political campaigns globally.\r\n\r\nQ788 Simon Hart: In countries that have similar electoral rules as this\r\ncountry, and they vary significantly, how do people account for your fee\r\nwhen they are making their declarations over election or referendum\r\nexpenditure? Into what detail do they necessarily go? I accept that you\r\nmay not be able to answer that.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: If it is their responsibility to report on their fees in their\r\nown country, the onus is on them to do so.\r\n\r\nQ789 Simon Hart: Are you ever asked to explain or to provide some kind of a\r\nbrief description of what the service actually is or do you simply—\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: At its broadest level we are providing campaign\r\nconsultancy and communication services, but if anyone wanted more\r\nspecific details, we are more than happy. The contracts that we engage in\r\nare based on a statement of work that is mapped out with the client and\r\nthese are well documented. It would be very easy for us to point to these\r\nagreements that detail exactly what areas we are working on.\r\n\r\nQ790 Simon Hart: You mentioned that you have 4,000 or 5,000 data points on\r\nevery adult in the United States—the entire voting population. Does every\r\nadult in the United States know that you have 4,000 or 5,000 data points\r\non them?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I can't speculate on what every adult in America knows.\r\nThat would be absurd.\r\n\r\nQ791 Simon Hart: It is very closely related to the earlier question about the\r\nextent to which people—you say you are not a data miner. How do you\r\nacquire that vast quantity of data without a certain amount of mining? Is\r\nit not a responsibility of yours to be able to ensure that the population is\r\naware that vast quantities of their data, personal and otherwise, is held\r\nby you and used for electoral purposes?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We have made no secret of this fact, as you all know,\r\nbecause you have referenced at least two occasions that I have stood in a\r\npublic forum and talked about the methodology that we use. That\r\nincludes the data that we underpin it with. I think we have been pretty\r\nconsistent.\r\n\r\nQ792 Simon Hart: But you said you were not a data miner?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Well, we are not because there are companies out there\r\nwhose singular purpose is to go out and collect and aggregate data, as Mr\r\nCollins said. With his background, he is very familiar with the experience\r\nin the Axioms and Infogroups and other very large companies who have\r\nhundreds, or indeed thousands, of employees whose singular job is to sit\r\non the phone and speak to companies and acquire their data, match it\r\ntogether, hygiene it, put it into a database and record, such that they can\r\nthen license these data to companies like ours. All we have done is gone\r\nto all the vendors, large, medium and small, and taken these data and\r\nput them into one database and record.\r\n\r\nQ793 Simon Hart: That then excuses you from the accusation that you are a\r\nminer? The fact that you are just mining what other people have mined\r\ndoes not contradict in any sense what you said earlier on?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I don't like the word \"accusation\" because that implies\r\nthat we are doing something wrong. This is an established business in the\r\nUnited States, which is selling data, and we, like many or most brands\r\nand many or most agencies, are able to go out and license these data for\r\nmarketing purposes.\r\n\r\nQ794 Simon Hart: At no stage was I suggesting there was anything illegal\r\nabout it. I was simply saying that you make a virtue out of the fact that\r\nyou possess probably more data on the entire voting population of the\r\nUnited States, thereby making a political point, than anybody else in the\r\nmarket. My question was simply to the extent to which that is known\r\nabout—I know we know about it, we are talking about it here—and the\r\nextent to which the individual voters know exactly how and would have\r\naccess to that information should they require it. If they come to you,\r\nyou would be able to disclose the 4,000 to 5,000 data points that you\r\npossess. If I was an American citizen, would you provide me with those\r\n4,000 to 5,000 data points were I ask you for them?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Let me address your first question. We are incredibly\r\nproud of the fact that we walked into one of the most competitive political\r\nmarkets, if not the most competitive political market, in the world as a\r\n\r\nsmall British tech company and were able to develop the sort of\r\ntechnologies and methodologies and bring them to market so effectively.\r\nThis is going to help the communications landscape way beyond politics.\r\nIt is going to help in advertising and marketing and make it more\r\nrelevant and much more economical. In terms of what you have asked\r\nabout American people undertaking what we call in Europe a subject\r\naccess request, the legislation is not currently in place in America for\r\nthem to do that, but were it there, we would be able to provide exactly\r\nthe same service that we provide for companies in the UK and across\r\nEurope. Following GDPR, we will be providing that for very many\r\nbusinesses to help them manage their own data as they seek to be\r\ncompliant with the new legislation that is being implemented.\r\n\r\nQ795 Chair: Mr Nix, when Leave.EU applied for designation to the Electoral\r\nCommission to be the official leave campaign, it named Cambridge\r\nAnalytica in its designation document. Why was that?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I was not aware of that but I can only assume, as I\r\nmentioned before, that they felt that associating themselves and aligning\r\nthemselves with Cambridge Analytica would give them extra credibility\r\nand leverage in trying to compete in a bidding process where they were\r\nclearly the underdogs to be the designated campaign.\r\n\r\nQ796 Chair: Has the Electoral Commission raised this with you as part of its\r\ninvestigation?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No, it hasn't.\r\n\r\nQ797 Chair: That is slightly strange. It is doing an investigation looking at\r\nLeave.EU's activities in the referendum. Your company is cited in their\r\ndesignation document as being someone they are working with and it has\r\nnot asked you about that.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Again, let me circle back to you, but I have not been\r\nasked that question. I can certainly find out for you whether my data\r\ncompliance team or colleagues have been asked it. I would like to think\r\nthat this inquiry has been going on for some time and we are delighted to\r\nhelp because we really want to make it clear that we did no work, as I\r\nhave been trying to do today in this Committee. I am hopeful that the\r\nElectoral Commission and the ICO have taken on board the evidence that\r\nwe have presented to them and that they are going to arrive at the same\r\nconclusion as I hope you will, which is that we were not involved,\r\ntherefore we can't speak to these things.\r\n\r\nQ798 Chair: That itself is a matter for the Electoral Commission. It is not\r\nsomething we are investigating but it is just another point of information\r\nthat is out there in the public domain that links the two of you.\r\n\r\nI have a few follow-up questions and then I think we will be done. If you\r\nwere conducting 300,000 to 400,000 surveys a month for the Trump\r\ncampaign over a five-month period, so let's say nearly 2 million surveys,\r\ndo you or your associates hold the data that was gathered from that\r\nexercise?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: These data belong to the Trump campaign.\r\n\r\nQ799 Chair: Okay, so you don't have any ongoing access to that?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Again, I will circle back to you on those specific pieces of\r\nresearch, because I don't know what the data-sharing agreement was\r\nwith the campaign on that specific piece of research. Generally these\r\nwould belong to the campaign, but if they have permissioned us to retain\r\na copy of them, we would have a copy of them.\r\n\r\nQ800 Chair: Thank you. Presumably with the Cruz campaign, you did have\r\npermission to have a copy of the data, because you said some of the data\r\nfrom the Cruz campaign could have been used in the Trump campaign.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is correct.\r\n\r\nQ801 Chair: From a layman's point of view, how is this data held? The data\r\nmust exist in a form that means it can be used for one campaign and\r\nthen repurposed for another campaign. Do you have data storage centres\r\nwhere you keep this data or how does it work?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is right. Some data is stored in secure facilities and\r\nsome is stored in the cloud, depending on how we need to access it.\r\n\r\nQ802 Christian Matheson: You took on Sophie Schmidt as an intern. Why did\r\nshe want to come and work for you?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: You are going to have to speak to Ms Schmidt about\r\nthat. I can't speculate.\r\n\r\nQ803 Christian Matheson: When you were interviewing her, did you not say,\r\n\"Why do you want to come and work for us?\"\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I would like to think that we were a company that she\r\nfound interesting and exciting to work for.\r\n\r\nQ804 Christian Matheson: When she went back to America, is it likely she\r\nthen introduced you to some of the senior players or the better known\r\nplayers in the tech world, such as her father, who is the boss of Google,\r\nand Peter Thiel, who is obviously very well known in the area as well? Did\r\nshe introduce you to Peter Thiel?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No, she did not introduce me to her father and she did\r\nnot introduce me to Peter Thiel. That is not correct.\r\n\r\nQ805 Christian Matheson: She has now gone to work for Uber. Have you\r\nshared any data from Google? Has Google given you any data?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: As far as I am aware, Google, like Facebook, is a walled\r\ngarden and does not share its data. It certainly has not shared any data\r\nwith us.\r\n\r\nQ806 Christian Matheson: That is you, as in Cambridge Analytica and SCL.\r\nAlexander Nix: That is us in the broader sense of the word.\r\n\r\nQ807 Christian Matheson: What about Uber? Have they provided you with\r\n\r\nany data?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We don't work with Uber at the moment.\r\n\r\nQ808 Christian Matheson: Did you previously?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No, we have never worked with Uber.\r\n\r\nQ809 Christian Matheson: Okay, so there has not been any sharing of any\r\ndata from Uber to any of your companies?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is correct.\r\n\r\nQ810 Christian Matheson: Thank you. Can I talk about the process here? You\r\nmust deal with huge amounts of data, and the Chairman was asking\r\nabout the way that you hold it and manage it. When you bring it all\r\ntogether, do you aggregate it yourself or do you use a company? Do you\r\nbuy in aggregation services?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No, we do it ourselves. That is part of the service that\r\nwe offer to our clients, and we do that both manually and have products\r\nthat we have developed to automate some of that functionality.\r\n\r\nQ811 Christian Matheson: Have you ever used a third party in the past to do\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Never.\r\n\r\nQ812 Christian Matheson: What is your relationship with Aggregate IQ?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We have no relationship with Aggregate IQ. We have\r\nhistorically used Aggregate IQ to develop some software for us. It was a\r\nstandalone project that lasted about six months, possibly, in 2014. My\r\nunderstanding—I will have to check this—is that we have not had any\r\ncommunication with them since early 2015.\r\n\r\nQ813 Christian Matheson: There was a licensing agreement in September\r\n2014. Is that what that was?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is right, yes. They built a small piece of software\r\nfor us, as a software development company.\r\n\r\nQ814 Christian Matheson: I have a diagram of the structure of the group,\r\nand it seems very complicated, with a bit of ownership here and a bit of\r\nownership there and some shareholdings here and there. In section 10 of\r\nthe latest accounts of SCL Elections Ltd there was a £24.2 million\r\npayment. Does this relate to the 19% of Cambridge Analytica in America\r\nLLC that is owned by SCL Elections or is it payment for work that would\r\nhave been undertaken by SCL Elections?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: You are going to have to help me understand the\r\nrelevance of the question of ownership of a private company to this\r\ninquiry into fake news, data and communications.\r\n\r\nQ815 Christian Matheson: Fake news obviously is the content that is being\r\nput out there, but it is also a question of the delivery method and how\r\nfake news is propagated. The structure of your companies is such that it\r\n\r\nis not quite clear not only who is owning them, but who is propelling that\r\nmeans of delivery. I am just quite curious.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We have never published a structure of our company, so\r\nI don't know what you are looking at or where that has come from, but\r\nas a private company we don't speak about our structure, our investors\r\nor our board members. If you would like more information on this, we\r\nmight be able to take this out of the public forum in the interests of\r\nhelping your Committee, but I don't think that is something I want to\r\nshare today.\r\n\r\nChristian Matheson: Okay. I will leave it at then. Thank you.\r\n\r\nQ816 Paul Farrelly: You said that you had worked across the world in political\r\ncampaigns. Could you tell us a little bit more about where else in the\r\nworld?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Again, in the interests of our clients, as a rule we do not\r\nspeak about client contracts unless we have the specific permission of\r\nthose clients, and that includes commercial, Government and political\r\ncontracts. What I can say is that we undertake eight or nine elections\r\nevery year, and we are not limited by geography, so this really could be\r\nfrom the Caribbean to Asia to Africa to Europe or everywhere. Some of\r\nthese are very large, very important national elections and some are\r\nsmaller, more local mayoral or state elections. It is really anywhere that\r\nyou can think of.\r\n\r\nQ817 Paul Farrelly: For the Ukraine?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Potentially.\r\n\r\nQ818 Paul Farrelly: Have you?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Well, as I said, we do not talk specifically about clients\r\nbut there are elections coming up in the Ukraine in the future. If there is\r\na good commercial opportunity there, we might look at it. I would have\r\nto speak to my elections team.\r\n\r\nQ819 Paul Farrelly: Would you work for anyone?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I think I have already addressed this. We only work for\r\nmainstream—\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: One person's despot might be one person's hero, but\r\ngenerally there are certain people who are unsavoury.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We work for mainstream political parties. We try to work\r\nonly in free and fair democracies, and we also have to be mindful of our\r\nother divisions. As I have already told this Committee, we do an awful lot\r\nof work for the British Government, the US Government and other allied\r\nGovernments. If there is any question whatsoever about a client that we\r\nmight take on in the political sphere, or even in the commercial sphere,\r\nwe always discuss this with the relevant parties in the US and in the UK—\r\nso that would be the Foreign Office or the State Department—saying, \"We\r\nhave had an inquiry to work in this country. Do you have any objections\r\n\r\nto this?\" It is in the interest of us to make sure that we are not building a\r\nbusiness over here that could damage our part of our business over here.\r\n\r\nQ820 Paul Farrelly: With candidates and parties, would you work for\r\ncampaign organisations such as super PACs?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes, we have done a number of campaigns on behalf of\r\nsuper PACs.\r\n\r\nQ821 Paul Farrelly: All on the Republican side?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is correct.\r\n\r\nQ822 Paul Farrelly: What about campaigning organisations like the American\r\nEnterprise Institute? Would you work with that sort of organisation?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Actually, I am not familiar with them, but we do work\r\nfor organisations and lobbying and advocacy groups across America. I\r\ncan't speak to them, but I can speak to other ones.\r\n\r\nQ823 Paul Farrelly: We have only the briefest biography of you that starts\r\nwith Manchester University and ends with you joining SCL in 2003. How\r\ndid you get into all this? How did you get into this line of business?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: A huge interest, I think. Fundamentally, I was working\r\nin corporate finance, which I did not find particularly fulfilling.\r\n\r\nQ824 Paul Farrelly: I was the same, actually. Where were you in corporate\r\nfinance?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: At a small UK merchant bank up the road from here,\r\nand I was looking for an opportunity to work in a slightly more relevant\r\nand fulfilling occupation.\r\n\r\nQ825 Paul Farrelly: You are not a data processing PhD yourself?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I am not a data PhD myself.\r\n\r\nQ826 Paul Farrelly: What qualifications do you have?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In terms of this company, I lead a management team so\r\nI don't need to be qualified as a data scientist. I need to be qualified to\r\nrun a business.\r\n\r\nQ827 Paul Farrelly: Lots of people in corporate finance are accountants or\r\nlawyers or, like me, none of them.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: As the CEO of a company, you know perfectly well that\r\nthere is so much you can learn in school and then there is a lot you can\r\nlearn in life. We have been doing this for many, many hours a week for\r\nmany weeks and for many years now and hopefully the fruits of that\r\nlabour are beginning to come together.\r\n\r\nQ828 Paul Farrelly: Did you start off as a lawyer or an accountant or just a\r\ngeneralist?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No, neither of those, just a generalist.\r\n\r\nQ829 Ian C. Lucas: Do you exercise any editorial control over the messages\r\nthat your clients send to, for example, electoral and political campaigns?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: All the messages that we propose to campaigns are\r\nsigned off by the campaigns themselves and go through campaign legal.\r\nThere is an internal compliance structure to make sure that we are not\r\ninfringing any legislation of the FEC or any other body that might be\r\ngoverning the work that we do.\r\n\r\nQ830 Ian C. Lucas: You propose messages as part of your role. In other\r\nwords, the initiative comes from you and then it goes to the campaign.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is correct. We interpret and draw insights from the\r\ndata, and we use those insights to devise the messaging strategy and the\r\nmessaging content. We then share these messages and content with the\r\ncampaign, and we discuss our strategy with them. Often there is a\r\ndialogue about that and some tweaks are made. We then push that\r\nthrough legal and compliance. They will give us their feedback and\r\nultimately the messages are disseminated.\r\n\r\nQ831 Ian C. Lucas: Presumably the campaign makes proposals to you and a\r\nsimilar process continues. In other words, they would have an idea for a\r\nmessage that they wanted to deliver to the elector and they would\r\npresent that to you. Would that be a situation that arises?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It might well do and then we might go out and roll out\r\none of those surveys that I talked about. We can go and test that\r\nmessage, or A/B test it, digitally for instance, and we could give them\r\nempirical feedback about which message was likely to perform better,\r\nhow it should be run and who should be targeted.\r\n\r\nQ832 Ian C. Lucas: Have you ever rejected a message from a campaign on\r\nethical grounds?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We run possibly thousands. I think in the last election in\r\nthe US we ran 4,000 different advertising campaigns—about 1.4 billion\r\nimpressions. We served for five months. I cannot speak to that.\r\n\r\nQ833 Ian C. Lucas: Can I just say why I am asking you the question? You\r\nhave been very keen to emphasise the benevolence of the role that your\r\ncompany is performing, fulfilling the public good of informing electors\r\nabout particular candidates and making campaigns relevant. But we are\r\nall grown-ups, here. We are all politicians on this side of the table. We\r\nknow that there is negative campaigning and there is positive\r\ncampaigning, and one of the dangers of mass communication in this\r\nformat is reinforcing, for example, very negative stereotypes. Do you\r\nagree with that?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: As politicians who understand campaigning, I think you\r\nwill also understand that winning elections is not about reinforcing\r\nprejudice on either side of the political spectrum. There is no point in\r\ntelling hardcore Republicans how bad Clinton is and how good Trump is,\r\nor vice versa. It is about correctly identifying the people that sit in the\r\nmiddle—the persuadable or swing voters—and presenting to them very\r\n\r\nwell articulated facts on the particular policies and issues that they care\r\nabout most, so they can begin to make their opinions.\r\n\r\nQ834 Ian C. Lucas: I agree with all of that, but it is also about finding those\r\nsame people and maybe reinforcing fears that they have, or perhaps it is\r\nabout emphasising bad aspects that they may possibly believe and that\r\ncould be reinforced. That is another way of persuading people in different\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In the case of negative campaigning, you would be\r\nright, and in the case of positive campaigning, it would be about\r\nemphasising the hopes they have—aka Obama 2008.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Absolutely.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It works both ways, and we are no strangers to positive\r\nand negative campaigns.\r\n\r\nQ835 Ian C. Lucas: I am talking about one particular way and, as you know,\r\nthis is about fake news. The reason I am asking you has there ever been\r\nan ethical reason why you have refused to run a particular ad is because\r\nI am aware of examples of campaign ads that I would not use in my\r\ncampaign, and I am a politician. Are you aware of any example of that\r\nkind, where Cambridge Analytica has said, \"We are not going to do that\"?\r\nThis is very relevant to the question of fake news.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I would like to say to you, sir, that I am sure there are\r\ndozens of examples, but—\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Can you go away and bring us some?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: To go through the 1.4 billion impressions that we served\r\nin last year's US elections, look at each one that we served, look at all\r\nthe ones that we rejected and come back to you would not be a\r\nreasonable request to put on us.\r\n\r\nQ836 Ian C. Lucas: What level of control is there over the ads that you project\r\nto people?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: I just discussed this with your colleague. The adverts\r\nthat we propose to the campaign are shared with the campaign and the\r\ncampaign signs them off. That goes to legal, and legal and compliance\r\nneed to sign them off. There is a process. There are checks and balances.\r\n\r\nQ837 Ian C. Lucas: Can you please give one? I am not asking for 1.2 million.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Billion.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Okay, billion. I am asking for one example. Are they all\r\ndifferent from each other?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ838 Ian C. Lucas: Every single one is different?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: No. There were some 4,000 campaigns that were\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nQ839 Ian C. Lucas: All I would like to see is one example of an ad where\r\nCambridge Analytica said, \"We're not going to allow this to go out. We\r\ndeny this\".\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: That is certainly something that we will look into.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nQ840 Chair: Thank you, Mr Nix. Just a couple of final questions. We have\r\nspoken quite a lot about the way in which you store, manage and gather\r\ndata, and how you seek to comply with the Data Protection Act in the UK.\r\nRather than going through any further detail today, perhaps you would\r\nbe able to write to the Committee to set out what your policies are on\r\nhow you source data, manage it, share it with third parties, and how you\r\nensure that you do so in compliance with the Data Protection Act?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Certainly. We will get back to you on that.\r\n\r\nQ841 Chair: You know that Julian Assange claimed that Cambridge Analytica\r\napproached WikiLeaks to work with them and that they rejected the offer.\r\nThat is a statement that he has put out. I know we touched on this\r\nearlier, but can you confirm whether any approach has ever been made\r\nto Julian Assange by Cambridge Analytica?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Yes, certainly. I would be happy to speak to that as I\r\ndid, I think, in front of a very large audience in Lisbon last year. This was\r\nat the time, as you will remember, when the newspapers and the news\r\nchannels were reporting that Julian Assange had access to a large\r\nquantity of information that could be incredibly relevant to the outcome\r\nof the US election. We read about these claims. We had no idea, as no\r\none did, whether this was true or not so we simply reached out to a\r\nspeaking agency that represents him—that was the only way we could\r\nfind to get hold of him—and said, \"Would you pass him a message\r\ncommenting on this and asking whether he would like to meet to discuss\r\nthis?\" and we received a message back through this third party, the\r\nintermediary, saying no, they would not. That was it. We, like probably\r\nevery other journalist in this room, were very keen to find out what was\r\nin these data and whether they would have an impact. We were all\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nQ842 Chair: You said earlier on that you gathered this large amount of data for\r\nthe Trump campaign as part of the survey work that was done and that\r\nyou will write to us to say whether that was data that you held or the\r\ncampaign held. If that was being gathered by you, obviously on behalf of\r\nthe campaign, would other people in the campaign have access to that\r\ndata and the ability to share that with third parties without your\r\nknowledge?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Quite unlikely. Hypothetically, anyone could possibly\r\nhave taken advantage of that but they would have had to have been\r\nsomeone on the inside who had taken the data illegally.\r\n\r\nQ843 Chair: Yes, but while you do not know that is the case, it would be\r\ntechnically possible, even if hypothetical?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: It is technically possible—and I am certainly not\r\nsuggesting this—that an employee may have illegally taken the data and\r\npassed it elsewhere, yes.\r\n\r\nQ844 Chair: Thank you. Again it is relevant to our question. I know that it is a\r\ncase relating to America, but to have some written evidence from you\r\nabout the protocols you have for data management and how you can\r\nmake sure that you keep people's data secure, and do so without being in\r\nbreach of the Data Protection Act, would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nFinally, on other countries where you have worked, have you ever\r\nworked in Russia or on behalf of Russian companies or organisations?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We have never worked in Russia. As far as I am aware,\r\nwe have never worked for a Russian company. We have never worked\r\nwith a Russian organisation in Russia or any other country. We do not\r\nhave any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.\r\n\r\nQ845 Chair: If a Russian company came along and said, \"Would you work for\r\nus?\" would you do it or would you reject that?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: There are many companies in Russia that are stand-up\r\ncompanies doing normal and fair business, so we would have to evaluate\r\nthat but, given the current climate, I do not think that would be\r\nnecessarily our first client of choice.\r\n\r\nQ846 Chair: Would you ever work on political campaigns in a third country on\r\nbehalf of someone else?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: We have worked on advocacy campaigns and we have\r\nworked on communication campaigns that have been for the benefit of\r\nother countries who wish to target other audiences. For instance, if the\r\nUK wants to drive tourism in America, we might do a campaign for the\r\nGovernment here. As a general rule, however, we look at these things\r\nvery carefully.\r\n\r\nQ847 Chair: A totally hypothetical example—not one that I have been given\r\nbut a hypothetical—is the referendum in Catalonia last year. If, say, a\r\ncommercial entity said, \"I have a big interest in the outcome of that\r\nreferendum because that region is commercially important to me. I want\r\nto run a campaign within that region that would encourage people to stay\r\nas part of Spain,\" would you take on a project like that as a UK-based or\r\nAmerican-based business, working maybe for a company in another\r\ncountry but targeting voters in yet another location?\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: In that hypothetical instance, we could not necessarily\r\nengage with a company, but if the company had an arrangement with a\r\npolitical party, and that was between them and they wanted to help that\r\npolitical party and the party brought us in, again those sorts of\r\ndiscussions would be outside of our remit and they would never need to\r\ninvolve us. We would be engaged by a political party. If they had a\r\nrelationship with a business or another third party regarding financing,\r\ndependent on the regulations in their particular country, that might be\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nQ848 Chair: Obviously it depends on the legislation because you could be in\r\nbreach of electoral law to be receiving funding from a third country to\r\nconduct political campaigns in another.\r\n\r\nAlexander Nix: Absolutely. That is why, again, we look at these things\r\nvery carefully. We have an in-house legal team. We have external legal\r\nteams. We choose our clients very carefully. We would never want to put\r\nourselves in a position like that. Of course not.\r\n\r\nChair: Thank you. I think that concludes our questions this morning.\r\nThank you very much for your time.",

Lucas; Julian Knight; Christian Matheson; Rebecca Pow; Brendan\r\nO'Hara; Jo Stevens; Giles Watling.\r\n\r\nQuestions 1271-1461\r\n\r\nWitnesses\r\n\r\nI: Paul-Olivier Dehaye and Christopher Wylie.\r\n\r\nWritten evidence from witnesses:\r\n\r\n-\tPaul-Olivier Dehaye\r\n\r\n-\tChristopher Wylie background papers\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nExamination of witnesses\r\n\r\nWitnesses: Paul-Olivier Dehaye and Christopher Wylie.\r\n\r\nQ1271 Chair: Welcome to this further evidence session of the Digital, Culture,\r\nMedia and Sport Select Committee, as part of our inquiry into\r\ndisinformation and fake news. I welcome Christopher Wylie and Paul-\r\nOlivier Dehaye to the Committee to give evidence this morning.\r\n\r\nBefore we start the Committee session, I would like to give an update on\r\nthe invitation of the Select Committee to Mark Zuckerberg to give\r\nevidence before us. We believe, given the serious nature of the\r\nallegations that have been made about the access and use of Facebook\r\nuser data, that it is appropriate that Mark Zuckerberg should give\r\nevidence to the Committee. He has suggested that Chris Cox, the chief\r\nproduct officer at Facebook, could come to London to give evidence to the\r\nCommittee in the first week after the Easter recess. We would be very\r\nhappy to invite Mr Cox to give evidence. However, we would still like to\r\nhear from Mr Zuckerberg as well. We will seek to clarify with Facebook\r\nwhether he is available to give evidence or not, because that was not\r\nclear from our correspondence. If he is available to give evidence we will\r\nbe happy to do that, either in person or by videolink if that would be\r\nmore convenient for him. I am happy to answer any further questions\r\nabout that after the hearing but that is all we would like to say on that at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nWe turn now to the evidence session this morning, and I will ask Chris\r\nWylie first. A lot of the Committee's work over the last few weeks has\r\nbeen looking at the role of Cambridge Analytica in the data analytics\r\nbusiness and their campaigns. We heard evidence from Alexander Nix a\r\nfew weeks ago. Could you explain how you first became involved with\r\nAlexander Nix and Cambridge Analytica?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: I first joined SCL Group, which is the parent\r\ncompany of Cambridge Analytica, before Cambridge Analytica existed, in\r\nJune 2013. I was introduced to him through a mutual contact that I had\r\nworked with previously in UK politics. SCL had an opening for a research\r\ndirector in part because the past research director died in his hotel room\r\nin Kenya when he was working for Uhuru Kenyatta. I did not know that at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason why I was chosen to become research director is\r\nbecause the firm was looking to expand its digital capacity and keep up\r\nwith the developments that were happening, particularly on the military\r\nside, looking at how information spreads online and developing new IP\r\nthat they could then pass on to clients, whether that is political or\r\nmilitary. Does that answer your question?\r\n\r\nQ1272 Chair: Yes. Can you explain how long you worked at and with Cambridge\r\nAnalytica and what caused you to leave the company?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: When I started in June 2013, Cambridge Analytica\r\ndid not exist yet. It is important for people to understand that Cambridge\r\nAnalytica is more of a concept or a brand than anything else because it\r\ndoes not have employees. It is all SCL, it is just the front-facing company\r\nfor the United States. I started at SCL Group in June 2013. In July 2014,\r\nI told Alexander Nix that I did not want to continue working at—then at\r\nthe time—Cambridge Analytica, although I scaled down my work until the\r\n2014 midterms; a year and a half.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, Cambridge Analytica was set up in large part because of the\r\nresearch I was doing at SCL Group. The IP that we were creating was\r\nacquired by Robert Mercer and Cambridge Analytica became the vehicle\r\nto acquire the IP.\r\n\r\nQ1273 Chair: You said that Cambridge Analytica does not have any employees,\r\nthat effectively they were all employed by SCL.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes.\r\n\r\nChair: How would you characterise the relationship between these\r\ndifferent companies? Is it one organisation that exists behind different\r\nfacades?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Cambridge Analytica was set up in part because,\r\nfirst, there was— the way it works is Cambridge Analytica was set up and\r\nSCL Elections, which is part of SCL Group, the group company, became a\r\nminority shareholder and then Robert Mercer became the majority\r\nshareholder of Cambridge Analytica. SCL assigned its intellectual property\r\nto Cambridge Analytica and Cambridge Analytica licensed back the IP to\r\nSCL Elections, and also granted SCL Elections an exclusivity contract\r\nwhereby all projects from Cambridge Analytica would be given to SCL to\r\nwork on, although the actual contracting on the client-facing side would\r\nbe with Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nPartly that was because in the United States there are particular rules\r\nagainst foreign actors in elections, so having an American company was\r\nbeneficial for that purpose. Also Robert Mercer's lawyers were concerned\r\nabout two things. The first was the optics of acquiring a UK military\r\ncontractor to work in American elections; optically that would not\r\nnecessarily play well. Secondly, they were concerned about some of the\r\nhistory of the shareholders in the company, as well as some of the past\r\nprojects they had worked on.\r\n\r\nQ1274 Chair: The company being SCL?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: SCL.\r\n\r\nQ1275 Chair: Cambridge Analytica was a company set up with the purpose of\r\ndoing political work in America?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: In the United States with a new brand that was\r\nuntainted by any history or legacy of past projects or shareholders.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ1276 Chair: A lot of people will ask—and I will ask—that given you are\r\nsomeone who worked very closely with these people for a period of time\r\nand understand this world very well, through your career working in it,\r\nwhy have you decided to speak out against it and give evidence against\r\npeople who used to be your colleagues?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: As a citizen, one is expected and has a duty to\r\nreport unlawful activity. If you are asking about my journey to this\r\nmoment, a lot of people have asked me, \"Why has it taken you so long?\"\r\nWhat they do not see is that I have been working on this with The\r\nGuardian, and then later The New York Times and Channel 4, for a year.\r\nWhat you are seeing is the climax of that. This is a year-long coming-out\r\nprocess. Before going public I started working with the ICO and UK\r\nauthorities to start their investigation.\r\n\r\nAlso, very shortly after I left Cambridge Analytica I was threatened with\r\nlegal action and had a very aggressive team of lawyers coming after me,\r\nso I signed an undertaking of confidentiality, which meant that if I broke\r\nthat, I could be sued into oblivion by Robert Mercer. Frankly, that is\r\nintimidating. When I was working at Cambridge Analytica and setting it\r\nup, you do not appreciate the future impact of what your work is until it\r\nstarts to happen. In 2016, I started looking at what this company was\r\ndoing in the United States and coming to appreciate that the projects that\r\nI was working on may have had a much wider impact than I initially\r\nanticipated they would.\r\n\r\nVery shortly after Donald Trump was inaugurated is when I started\r\nworking with Carole Cadwalladr at The Guardian on reporting some of the\r\nthings that the company is doing. In the spring I was one of her key\r\nsources anonymously until we could figure out a legal position that would\r\nthen allow me to come forward.\r\n\r\nQ1277 Chair: Would it be fair to say that, for you, Donald Trump's election\r\ncrossed a line? You felt the techniques that you were aware had been\r\nused should not have been used in the way they were during the\r\ncampaign and you felt you had to speak out about it. Would that be a\r\nway of characterising it?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: I would not say it is just because of Donald Trump,\r\nbut Donald Trump makes it click in your head that this has a much wider\r\nimpact. I do not think that military-style information operations is\r\nconducive for any democratic process, whether it is the US presidential or\r\na local council race.\r\n\r\nQ1278 Chair: When Cambridge Analytica was founded, was the algorithm, the\r\ndatabase, inherited from SCL or was that something that you developed\r\nor was it developed by other people?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: This is partly why I was brought on as research\r\ndirector, because SCL was falling behind in its technical capacity, in its\r\nquantitative skillset. Before I joined, SCL did not have any data assets, so\r\nthat was in large part why I was hired. It was the Ripon projects that\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nacquired data and scaled it. It was at that moment that they started\r\nbecoming more focused on data science.\r\n\r\nQ1279 Chair: I have seen a report that the idea of the name Cambridge\r\nAnalytica was Steve Bannon's. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes, it is a bizarre story. Alexander Nix has his\r\nstandard pitch, and it often relies heavily on, \"We have offices in\r\nMayfair,\" and, \"I went to Eton,\" presenting a very posh veneer of the\r\ncompany. A lot of their clients are developing countries in the\r\nCommonwealth and that sort of image plays well with certain types of\r\nclients he had worked with in the past. The problem was that Steve\r\nBannon did not care about that. He was much more interested in going\r\nand speaking at student events at Cambridge than sitting in a posh office\r\nin Mayfair.\r\n\r\nAlexander realised that, and he decided to set up a fake office in\r\nCambridge so that whenever Steve Bannon— this is before Steve Bannon\r\ncame on board to set up a project, which eventually became CA.\r\nWhenever Bannon came, we set up this fake office to present a more\r\nacademic side of the company. It was from that that Steve Bannon\r\ndecided we should call it Cambridge Analytica, because of how closely\r\nassociated it was with the university. In his head it was a very academic\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nQ1280 Chair: Other than that geographical proximity, did the company have\r\nany particular relationship with Cambridge University?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: It did not have a formal relationship, but we did\r\nwork with a lot of professors at the University of Cambridge, in particular\r\nthe psychology department and the psychometric centre.\r\n\r\nQ1281 Chair: They would deal with such projects and assist with developing\r\ntechniques and ideas?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes. Cambridge has an amazing psychology\r\ndepartment. It is one of the top—if not the top—in the world for\r\npsychology, so it was a real resource to have that very close to us. We\r\ndid work with several professors at the psychology department on\r\ndeveloping psychometric inventories and also looking more broadly at the\r\nresearch that was coming out of the university in psychological profiling\r\nusing online data exhausts. A lot of the papers that eventually became\r\nthe foundation of the methods that were used on the Ripon project came\r\nout of research that was being done at the University of Cambridge, some\r\nof which was funded in part by DARPA, which is the US military's research\r\nagency.\r\n\r\nQ1282 Chair: Did you approach academics on an ad hoc basis or was there any\r\nengagement with university authorities or any of the departments?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: We definitely talked to some of the more senior\r\nprofessors, but there was nothing formalised with the university itself. It\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nwas all done professor to professor to professor, but it sat in a grey area.\r\nWhen Ripon was happening we were engaging with a lot of people at\r\nCambridge who played a pivotal role in getting that project going.\r\n\r\nQ1283 Paul Farrelly: Essentially your central motivation has been that you are\r\nrather aghast that techniques in the social media world that have been\r\nused for military PSYOPs purposes are being used in the political domain?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: That is a part of it. Also, more broadly, when you\r\nlook at how Cambridge Analytica operates or how SCL operates, they do\r\nnot care whether or not what they do is legal, as long as it gets the job\r\ndone. There has been a lot of focus on the data side of things and there\r\nhas been a lot of focus on targeting, but this is a company that goes\r\naround the world and undermines the big institutions of countries that\r\nare struggling to develop those institutions.\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of reasons why I find the company problematic. It is not\r\njust the data. It is also more broadly that they are an example of what\r\nmodern-day colonialism looks like. You have a wealthy company from a\r\ndeveloped nation going into an economy or a democracy that is still\r\nstruggling to get its feet on the ground and taking advantage of that to\r\nprofit from that. There are several reasons why I find the company\r\nproblematic.\r\n\r\nQ1284 Paul Farrelly: Do they like to have an aura of being the SMERSH of the\r\nmodern digital age?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: The \"smash\"?\r\n\r\nChair: SMERSH. It is from James Bond, the evil organisation that\r\nmanipulates things here, there and everywhere across the world.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: If you watch the Channel 4 undercover, you can see\r\nfor yourself that they know that is the brand that it presents and they\r\ncultivate that. I think they find it amusing.\r\n\r\nQ1285 Paul Farrelly: I sort of get it. I did not quite know what to make of Mr\r\nNix when he came to us, apart from he was a corporate financier who\r\nsought a higher calling, as he almost said it to us. I remember on\r\nChannel 4 one of the most hilarious bits was a chap called Mark Turnbull\r\nwho had a big plaster on this nose saying that he was a master of\r\ndisguise.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: He does not always have the plaster on his nose.\r\n\r\nQ1286 Paul Farrelly: We want to get on to some of the things that happened in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, but just before we do, I wanted to probe into\r\nyour predecessor who died in Kenya. I have not heard of that. He was\r\nworking for the Kenyatta campaign.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes.\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: Were there any suspicious circumstances?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: I have heard several different stories as to what\r\nhappened, so I do not know which story is accurate. But when you work\r\nin Kenyan politics, or politics in a lot of African countries, if a deal goes\r\nwrong, you can pay for it.\r\n\r\nQ1287 Paul Farrelly: Is this a matter of public record or is this new now?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Dan was my predecessor and his death did cause\r\nsome news coverage in Romania because he was the son of a Cabinet\r\nMinister in Romania, who is now in jail for corruption charges, I think. He\r\ncame from a political family in Romania and the fact that he died was\r\nnews. I have heard different stories of the circumstances of his death, so\r\nI am not sure which is—\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: His name was Dan?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: His surname starts with a M.\r\n\r\nPaul-Olivier Dehaye: Muresan. He was working simultaneously in India,\r\nI think, and there is also some—\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: Simultaneously in India?\r\n\r\nPaul-Olivier Dehaye: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1288 Paul Farrelly: When you look at Facebook's biggest market—I\r\nmentioned this in the States as well—India is the top in numbers of users\r\nand that is a country that is rife with political discord and opportunities\r\nfor destabilisation.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: They have worked extensively in India. They have\r\nan office in India.\r\n\r\nQ1289 Paul Farrelly: This might be something we want to pursue later. When\r\nyou were told that there was a vacancy because your predecessor died in\r\nKenya, what explanation did the company give to you of that death?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: When I was hired I was not told that my\r\npredecessor had died in Kenya in his hotel room. That was several\r\nmonths, after when I asked about who I was replacing, because I was\r\nlooking for some old files that I could not find. I did realise, but I did not\r\nknow the name of the person who I replaced, so I asked about—looking\r\nthrough old files. That is where it came out that he died.\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: Same question two months on: what explanation were\r\nyou given of the— how old was he, do you know?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: He was in his 30s.\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: Did they give you an explanation?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: They did. If I explain it, if you understand that it is\r\npure speculation, so I am not stating this as a matter of fact. I am\r\nrepeating what I heard.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nWhat I heard was that he was working on a deal of some sort. I am not\r\nsure exactly what kind of deal it was, but when you work for senior\r\npoliticians in a lot of these countries, you do not make money in the\r\nelectoral work, you make money in the influence brokering after the fact.\r\nA deal went sour and—again this is what I have been told, so I am not\r\nsaying this is a matter of fact—and people suspected that he was\r\npoisoned in his hotel room. I also heard that the police were bribed to not\r\nenter the hotel room for 24 hours. But that is what I was told. I was not\r\nthere, so I cannot speak to the veracity of that account, but that is what I\r\nwas told.\r\n\r\nQ1290 Paul Farrelly: We will leave that there for the moment, because there\r\nare plenty of journalists who might want to follow some of those\r\ninteresting leads. One of the things Mr Nix was at pains to stress when he\r\nwas in front of us was that there were different companies, different\r\nentities—data could go one way but not another way, because of\r\ngovernment contracting. But there was one name that came up as the\r\ndata controller that was common between Cambridge Analytica and SCL,\r\nalmost demonstrating that there were common personnel,\r\nnotwithstanding the denials, which was a lady called Jordanna Zetter. Do\r\nyou know her?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: I do not\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: She is just a name?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: It is just a name, but they do put lots of random\r\nnames on all kinds of things.\r\n\r\nQ1291 Paul Farrelly: I do not know if you have seen this pictogram of the SCL\r\nstructure. It has been done by an independent journalist. It is just from\r\nfilings at Companies House, so it is fairly standard. It is fairly complicated\r\nfor a relatively small company.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: I'd wager that there are probably more companies\r\nthan even what is on that piece of paper.\r\n\r\nQ1292 Paul Farrelly: There are some interesting names that crop up. Mr Nix we\r\nknow about—the Etonian salesman I think you almost described him as.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: My understanding is that the reason why Alexander\r\nNix was involved in SCL was because his father had shares in the\r\ncompany and his father died. He inherited shares or there was some deal\r\nthat was done, because he has no background in psychology, tech,\r\npolitics, any of the things that they operate in. He is a salesman; he likes\r\nto sell stuff.\r\n\r\nQ1293 Paul Farrelly: While I was cooking Sunday lunch this weekend I listened\r\nto a BBC profile of Nigel Oakes. Did you come across him?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes, although not day to day. When we were setting\r\nup Cambridge Analytica, one of the reasons why SCL Elections rather\r\nthan either the group company or another entity was the minority\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nshareholder was because Alexander Nix wanted to keep more control for\r\nhimself. He was quite paranoid about some of the other shareholders and\r\ndirectors in the group company, so he made a concerted effort to keep\r\nthis project away from the others as long as possible. I did come across\r\nhim several times, but it was not day to day. I did not work with him day\r\nto day.\r\n\r\nQ1294 Paul Farrelly: From his profile, Mr Oakes came across as the founding\r\neminence grise behind the whole project.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: No, not for Cambridge Analytica. For SCL, yes, but\r\nnot for Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was Steve Bannon,\r\nRobert Mercer and Alexander Nix. Most of those negotiations happened in\r\nAmerica. They kept it pretty separate from the legacy shareholders and\r\ndirectors of SCL. He played a pivotal role in setting up SCL Group.\r\n\r\nQ1295 Paul Farrelly: Can I just throw the role of a couple of other people: the\r\nrole of the chairman, Julian Wheatland, and Victor Tchenguiz?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: They got rid of Tchenguiz when they were finalising\r\nthe Cambridge Analytica deal. The Mercer lawyers did not like\r\nTchenguiz's involvement because apparently he had fairly sketchy\r\nbusiness dealings that they did not want to be associated with.\r\n\r\nQ1296 Paul Farrelly: What was Julian Wheatland's role?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: I believe he was the chairman, so he did not do\r\nmuch. He was like the Queen of the company—not to say the Queen does\r\nnot do a lot. Sorry, do not interpret that as a slight on the Queen.\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: I am putting these other names up because there is a\r\ndanger that one focus is just on Mr Nix, who has a very sinister surname.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: For a lot of these guys, their role is not to do work,\r\nit is to do deals. They do not do anything day to day. They are the ones\r\nwho, because of their family or because of their businesses or what-have-\r\nyou, have a very wide network of people—not just here in the UK but, in\r\nparticular, in Africa and various developing countries—that enables the\r\ncompany to go and get working contracts. Their roles were usually like as\r\nthe introducer, as the dealmaker, not managing the day-to-day\r\noperations of the company.\r\n\r\nQ1297 Paul Farrelly: Would you characterise them as people who wanted to\r\nmake a fortune out of this, or people who are genuinely curious about the\r\nability, through social media in the digital age, for them to be able to\r\nmanipulate outcomes in politics?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: You have to remember that a lot of these people are\r\nvery wealthy already, so it is not Alexander Nix in particular. There is one\r\ntime where he had to go and we were running late because he had to\r\npick up a £200,000 chandelier. These are people who do not need to\r\nmake a lot of money, but the thing that I learned is that for certain\r\nwealthy people they need something to keep them occupied and they\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nneed projects. Going into the developing world and running a country is\r\nsomething that appeals to them. I did not mean that in a flippant way, if\r\nthat came across as flippant.\r\n\r\nQ1298 Paul Farrelly: This charter has no mention of Aggregate IQ or SCL\r\nCanada, as it styled itself. What is the relationship between that Canadian\r\ncompany and the rest of this group?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Very shortly after I became research director at\r\nSCL, I was given the directive or the mandate to expand the company's\r\nsoftware capacity and technological infrastructure and we obviously\r\nneeded people to do that. I reached out to people I had worked with on\r\nprevious projects who I respected. One of those people was Jeff Silvester,\r\nwho is now the CTO of Aggregate IQ.\r\n\r\nIn the first email that I sent, which I have also passed on to the\r\nCommittee—I passed on several folders of documents—where I tell Jeff\r\nthat I have just become a research director, \"This is what we do\", his\r\nimmediate reaction is, \"You need a Canadian office\". He replied, \"You\r\nneed a Canadian office\". When I went to Alexander Nix and I said, \"There\r\nare a couple of Canadians that I want to hire,\" he said, \"Fine, but they\r\nhave to come here and work in London.\" When I talked with Jeff and\r\nseveral other people, who later became AIQ, they had new families, had\r\njust got a house, and it is not easy to just get up and move to a different\r\ncountry when you have young kids. I went back to Alexander and said,\r\n\"Look, they're not mobile, but I think they would be helpful because\r\nthey're good at what they do.\" The compromise was that a Canadian\r\ncompany would be set up. That would enable the Canadians who wanted\r\nto work on the projects— and keep in mind at the time this is SCL, this is\r\nbefore Cambridge Analytica was set up, so primarily we were focused on\r\nprojects in the developing world.\r\n\r\nBut the deal was that they would sign an intellectual property licence\r\nwhereby all of the work that they were doing for the company would be\r\nassigned to SCL Group and they would trade as SCL Canada, but they set\r\nup a Canadian entity, and the legal name was Aggregate IQ. That was\r\nalso in part because when you work in a lot of countries, sometimes it is\r\nbeneficial to have different billing names on invoices. If you are working\r\nin a country that has declarable expenses and all that, you can—\r\nparticularly if you are trying to get around co-ordination rules, like in the\r\nUnited States, which has very strict non-co-ordination rules. If you can\r\nbill as several different companies but it is the same team working on it,\r\nthe paperwork looks compliant even if the project is not.\r\n\r\nQ1299 Paul Farrelly: It is a Canadian-based shell company, effectively?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes. I would call it like a franchise. On internal staff\r\ndocuments, for example this internal staff list—which I have also passed\r\non to the Committee—AIQ staff are listed under SCL Canada. The internal\r\ndocuments of the company refer to this entity, AIQ, as SCL Canada, as I\r\nhave been saying for months, but has now been validated yesterday by\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nGizmodo, which is a website that has found the code base that AIQ built\r\nthat shows that AIQ built the Ripon platform for Cambridge Analytica.\r\nThere is now tangible proof in the public domain that AIQ built Ripon,\r\nwhich is the software that utilised the algorithms from the Facebook data.\r\nI could talk more about some of the other projects that AIQ has worked\r\non.\r\n\r\nIn the Nigerian project in 2015, which Carole Cadwalladr at The Guardian\r\nhas touched on in her reporting, the company utilises services of an\r\nIsraeli private intelligence firm, and that firm is Black Cube. That has not\r\nbeen reported, although Channel 4 has undercover footage, that they\r\nhave not been able to put into the public domain, of Alexander Nix talking\r\nabout the relationship with Black Cube. On the Nigeria project, Black\r\nCube was engaged to hack the now President of Nigeria, Buhari, to get\r\naccess to his medical records and private emails. AIQ worked on that\r\nproject. AIQ was handed material in Nigeria from Cambridge Analytica to\r\ndistribute online. That is distribution of kompromat, and that is also\r\ndistribution of incredibly threatening and violent video content, which I\r\nhave also passed on to the Committee. The videos that AIQ distributed in\r\nNigeria with the sole intent of intimidating voters included content where\r\npeople were being dismembered, were having their throats cut and\r\nbleeding to death in a ditch, being burned alive. There are incredibly anti-\r\nIslamic and threatening messages portraying Muslims as violent.\r\n\r\nYou have Aggregate IQ, which received 40% of Vote Leave's funding,\r\nalso working on projects that involved hacked material and kompromat\r\nand distributing violent videos of people being bled to death to intimidate\r\nvoters. This is the company that played an incredibly pivotal role in\r\npolitics here. Something that I would strongly recommend to the\r\nCommittee is that they not only push the authorities here, but give them\r\nthe support that they need in order to investigate this company and what\r\nthey were doing in Brexit.\r\n\r\nQ1300 Paul Farrelly: Most of the reporting here has been focused on the\r\nCambridge Analytica link, or lack of link, with Leave.EU, rather than\r\niterate entities, links with Vote Leave, both from a Vote Leave campaign,\r\nand also the money that has been diverted off to BeLeave. The other\r\nfocus of the recording has been the amount of Facebook data that has\r\nbeen collected through Aleksandr Kogan's activities, which mostly seems\r\nto relate to the States. Clearly, the question underlying all this is that if\r\nyou are going to spend such a lot of money trying to influence the UK\r\nreferendum, to be able to do that you have to have a set of data on lots\r\nof UK individuals to make it worth people's while spending the money\r\nwith you. I hope the extent of the UK data that are held by Cambridge\r\nAnalytica and its affiliates and associates might come out in this session.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: One of the things I have also passed on to the\r\nCommittee is some of the contractual documentation and emails from\r\nsome of AIQ's past projects. One of them was at the time the Minister of\r\nnational security of Trinidad. In the contractual documents, and then also\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nemail chains of AIQ, part of the project was to go out and find a way of\r\naccessing raw internet service provider data for the entire country, to\r\nmonitor what people were browsing in that country. As I understand it,\r\nthat is not legal in Trinidad. It certainly would not be legal here.\r\n\r\nBut the thing that I would say is that Aggregate IQ, in part because it\r\nwas set up and works within the auspices of Cambridge Analytica,\r\ninherited a lot of the company culture of total disregard for the law. I\r\nwould again try to encourage looking at this question of where did they\r\nget the data. When I met with Dom Cummings in November 2015, one of\r\nthe things that was apparent is that Vote Leave at the time did not have\r\nany data. That is November 2015. Dom Cummings in part wanted to\r\nmeet with me because he was interested in Cambridge Analytica. He also\r\nsaid that he wanted to have the \"Palantir for politics\", but it became\r\napparent that if you do not even have the electoral register, let alone a\r\nsocial database, you cannot do this, or you cannot do this legally. Very\r\nshortly after that meeting they then engaged AIQ, I think in part—\r\nalthough this bit is me speculating—because it would look odd if Leave.EU\r\nis working with Cambridge Analytica and Vote Leave was working with\r\nCambridge Analytica. But you could get the next best thing, which is a\r\ncompany that can do virtually everything that CA can do but with a\r\ndifferent billing name for your invoices.\r\n\r\nBut my question is: where did you get the data? How do you create a\r\nmassive targeting operation in a country that AIQ had not previously\r\nworked in in two months? It baffles me as to how that could happen in\r\nsuch a short amount of time. That is a good question. It is unfortunate\r\nthat AIQ hides behind jurisdictional barriers and does not come here and\r\nanswer those questions. But it is something that hopefully can be looked\r\nat as to how did it actually work.\r\n\r\nThis is a company that has worked with hacked material. This is a\r\ncompany that will send out videos of people being murdered to intimidate\r\nvoters. This is a company that goes out and tries to illicitly acquire live\r\ninternet browsing data of everyone in an entire country. A lot of\r\nquestions should be asked about the role of Aggregate IQ in this election,\r\nand whether they were compliant with the law here, beyond just\r\nspending infractions.\r\n\r\nQ1301 Chair: Thank you. We have quite a few colleagues who want to come in\r\non this particular point. If I could say for the record and people following\r\nthe proceedings that Chris Wylie has given the Committee access to a\r\nlarge number of documents that he has. We received those this morning\r\nand we will be looking to go through those and discuss those with him,\r\nwith a view to publishing some of those documents probably tomorrow,\r\nbut certainly as soon as we can practically go through them and look\r\nthrough them. The allegation you make about AIQ and Nigeria is very\r\nserious. Do the documents in the folders you have given us provide\r\nevidence to support that allegation?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: You have one of the videos that I am referring to\r\nand I would recommend following Carole Cadwalladr's reporting on the\r\nmatter because she has done a ton of work on researching it. She has\r\npublished some articles on the Nigeria hacking scheme also. But AIQ was\r\ninvolved in the Nigeria project, both as the company and then several\r\npeople also individually who also frequently work at AIQ.\r\n\r\nQ1302 Ian C. Lucas: I want to put to Mr Wylie a statement that was made by\r\nAggregate IQ on their website on Saturday, 24 March 2018. They said,\r\n\"Aggregate IQ is a digital advertising web and software development\r\ncompany based in Canada. It is and has always been 100% Canadian\r\nowned and operated. Aggregate IQ has never been and is not a part of\r\nCambridge Analytica or SCL\". What is your reaction to that statement?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: They are using weasel words. That is all technically\r\ntrue but let me be super clear. They are based in Canada; that is true.\r\nThey are a Canadian company; that is true. They are not owned but they\r\nhave licensed their intellectual property. Secondly, the basis of the\r\nsoftware of Cambridge Analytica— for example, they built the Ripon\r\nproject. They operate as an internal entity. They are kept at arm's length,\r\nin part because that was useful, particularly for American projects, where\r\nyou need different entities to work on campaigns and pacts and various\r\nother entities where you cannot necessarily co-ordinate. But if you have\r\ndifferent companies, the paperwork looks appropriate and the paperwork\r\nlooks compliant, even if behind the scenes you are talking back and forth\r\nand using the same underlying technology. They built Ripon. Ripon was\r\nthe software that these algorithms went into that then deployed the data\r\nto target—the actual advertising deployment was on them. That is what\r\nthey did.\r\n\r\nIt is fine and dandy for them to say, \"We are a Canadian company.\" That\r\nis true, but if you unmask what they do and look at how they operate and\r\nthe projects they have worked on, the overwhelming majority of those\r\nprojects and the overwhelming majority of their income comes from, and\r\ncame from, Cambridge Analytica and SCL.\r\n\r\nQ1303 Ian C. Lucas: Are you in a position to say definitively today that\r\nCambridge Analytica shared its data with AIQ?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: It depends on what you mean by \"its data\".\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Shared any data.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes, absolutely. You cannot create software that\r\ndeploys adverts or targets people online or has a front-end interface for\r\nyou to query data without accessing the data itself. You cannot have\r\ntargeting software that does not access the database. CA would have a\r\ndatabase and AIQ would be able to access that, because otherwise the\r\nsoftware does not work, if you see what I am saying.\r\n\r\nQ1304 Ian C. Lucas: Yes, I see what you are saying. We have evidence now\r\nthat Facebook data was used by Cambridge Analytica and it is accepted,\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\neven by Facebook, that that information was unlawfully transferred to\r\nCambridge Analytica. Can you say that AIQ had access to that data?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes, because the Ripon software and the Ripon\r\nproject was the modelling of that Facebook data, among other datasets,\r\nand then the deployment of that data in online targeting and various\r\nother political projects. It was AIQ that provided documents in terms of\r\nthe contract. What I provided to the Committee is the contractual\r\ndocuments and the IP licensing for that. Yesterday, the website Gizmodo\r\nfound a lot of the actual underlying code with the software development\r\ncomments between AIQ and SCL developers. Not only do you have\r\naccess to the contractual documents, which are provided to the\r\nCommittee, but also if you look at what Gizmodo is reporting you can see\r\nthe code.\r\n\r\nQ1305 Rebecca Pow: I was interested in you saying early where did they get\r\nthe data from and I just wanted to get this on the record. We had\r\nAlexander Nix here and I asked him about whether they had used\r\nFacebook data. He categorically said, \"We do not work with Facebook. We\r\ndo not have Facebook data but we do use it as a platform to advertise.\r\nWe do gather data from Facebook and we do surveys\".\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: We do not have Facebook data but we gather\r\nFacebook data.\r\n\r\nRebecca Pow: Exactly. What would you say to that? Do you think that\r\nwas absolutely a lie that they did have Facebook data—they were\r\ngathering it, they were using it? On the back of that, if we have this link\r\nbetween Cambridge Analytica and Aggregate IQ, a company that Robert\r\nMercer owns, surely they must be using the data.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: To address your first point, it is categorically untrue\r\nthat Cambridge Analytica has never used Facebook data. Facebook data\r\nand the acquisition, using Aleksandr Kogan's app, was the foundational\r\ndataset of the company. That is how the algorithms were developed.\r\nThey spent $1 million at least on that acquisition project. What I have\r\nprovided to the Committee is the signed contracts with Aleksandr Kogan's\r\nsignature and Alexander Nix's signature on a contract that references\r\nusing an app that harvests Facebook data and friend network data also.\r\n\r\nQ1306 Rebecca Pow: They have led us up the garden path for a long time and\r\nnow we are getting to the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Alexander Nix's comments to your Committee were\r\nexceptionally misleading. I would say not only misleading but I think they\r\nwere dishonest.\r\n\r\nPaul-Olivier Dehaye: There has also been on YouTube on the public\r\nrecord for a long time two videos from 2015 where you see interns— at\r\nleast in one of the videos you see an intern who was working at\r\nCambridge Analytica describing his work in a public forum, his work using\r\nFacebook likes to model psychographics and he is describing his work at\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nCambridge Analytica. When The Guardian contacted Cambridge Analytica\r\nthe video was removed, even though it was controlled by a different\r\nentity called ASI Data Science. I had managed to download that video so\r\nI have it and I put it on the record.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: ASI Data Science also worked for Vote Leave. ASI\r\nwas one of the subcontractors to Cambridge Analytica and they provided\r\na lot of the data scientists that Cambridge Analytica used to do their\r\nmodelling work. Vote Leave used Aggregate IQ and they also used ASI.\r\nTheir chief technology officer, Tom Borwick, also worked on projects for\r\nSCL Group in Trinidad and Antigua. More broadly a question that should\r\nbe asked is: why is it that all these entities were being used? Given that\r\nDom Cummings was very interested in Cambridge Analytica, and not only\r\nCambridge Analytica but more broadly Robert Mercer's work in\r\nRenaissance Technologies—which is his hedge fund—what did Dom\r\nCummings know and why is it that he was using Aggregate IQ and ASI\r\nData Science? Why is it that their CTO was also somebody who ran\r\nprojects for SCL Group around the world? To her credit, Carole\r\nCadwalladr at The Guardian has been raising these questions for a year\r\nnow. It would be appropriate for your Committee and other Committees\r\nto start raising those questions also. What was happening inside of Vote\r\nLeave and why were these companies chosen?\r\n\r\nQ1307 Julie Elliott: This is fascinating. Quite a lot of the things that I was\r\nwanting to ask have come out in evidence. It sounds to me as if all of\r\nthese different names of things are to just try to confuse what on earth is\r\ngoing on here—not by you but by the companies in the way they have\r\nbeen set up. If AIQ were being paid for work for the Vote Leave campaign\r\nand others, do you think they were working to a common plan for paid\r\nwork to get a common result or do you think they have all been working\r\nseparately?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Which common plan are you referring to?\r\n\r\nJulie Elliott: For the various leave campaigns, which was to get a leave\r\nvote in the referendum.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: I supported leave, despite having pink hair and a\r\nnose ring. I am one of the rare breeds of progressive eurosceptics. I do\r\nnot believe in the current Brexit plan, but I do speak as somebody who—\r\nfor me, this is not about remain or leave. This is about the integrity of the\r\ndemocratic process, which is more important than anything else. I just\r\nwant to preface what I say. I am absolutely convinced that there was a\r\ncommon plan and common purpose with Vote Leave, BeLeave, the DUP,\r\nand Veterans for Britain. All of these companies somehow, for some\r\nreason, decided to use Aggregate IQ as their primary service provider\r\nwhen Aggregate IQ did not have any public presence, no media, no\r\nwebsite. The only way you could find them on the internet is if you went\r\nto SCL's website and called them SCL Canada.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nThe first question I have is: why is it that all of a sudden this company\r\nthat has never worked on anything but Cambridge Analytica projects,\r\nthat had no public presence, somehow became the primary service\r\nprovider to all of these supposedly independent and different campaign\r\ngroups? Secondly, what I have provided to the Electoral Commission is\r\nthree binders of evidence—about this high—of emails, documents,\r\ninvoices, chat logs, activity logs, system logs, screen caps, of\r\nconversations that were happening inside of Vote Leave, in particular with\r\nreference to the BeLeave project, which was the single largest\r\nexpenditure of Vote Leave went to BeLeave. When you look at the\r\naccumulation of evidence, I think it would be completely unreasonable to\r\ncome to any other conclusion that this must be co-ordination; this must\r\nbe a common-purpose plan.\r\n\r\nAfter BuzzFeed released their first article on, \"Isn't it bizarre that a\r\nfashion student who is 22 receives £625,000 in the last two weeks of the\r\nreferendum? Isn't it weird that this Canadian company that no one has\r\never heard of received 40% of Leave's spending?\", having introduced\r\nDarren and Shamir to Vote Leave and having set up this company, I was\r\ngenuinely concerned that something unlawful happened. It does not pass\r\nthe smell test. When I went and spoke to Aggregate IQ, they were very\r\npleased with themselves as to how that project went—understandably,\r\nthey won. But I asked them, \"Can you show me what it is you are doing?\r\nWhat was your secret? How did you win? What did you do?\" They\r\nconceded to me, and this is a verbatim quote—and I stand by; I\r\nremember Jeff Silvester telling me this—it was \"totally illegal\". But they\r\nfound it amusing, because you have to remember that this is a company\r\nthat has gone around the world and undermined democratic institutions\r\nin all kinds of countries. They could not care less as to whether or not\r\ntheir work is compliant because they like to win.\r\n\r\nI asked them, \"Okay, show me some of the work that you have done.\" I\r\nasked them, \"Did you silo the data? Did you silo your advertising?\" If you\r\nare doing problematic advertising, if you do not silo your programmes\r\ninto different campaigns, the results of one campaign will influence the\r\nresults of the other campaign. They said absolutely not, it was all just\r\none common ad programme, which means that Aggregate IQ was just\r\nused as a proxy money-laundering vehicle. What Dom Cummings did is\r\nhe went around and found places that he could just launder money\r\nthrough to give it to AIQ so that they could overspend. That is my\r\ngenuinely held belief.\r\n\r\nIt makes me so angry because a lot of people supported leave because\r\nthey believe in the application of British law and British sovereignty, and\r\nto irrevocably alter the constitutional settlement of this country on fraud\r\nis a mutilation of the constitutional settlement of this country. You cannot\r\ncall yourself a leaver, you cannot call yourself somebody who believes in\r\nBritish law and win by breaking British law in order to achieve that goal.\r\n\r\nQ1308 Julie Elliott: Is it your belief as well that the law was broken?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Absolutely. I am so angry that two people that I\r\nintroduced in good faith— it is hard for a lot of young people to get\r\ninvolved in politics, and I introduced these two young people to volunteer\r\non a campaign to Stephen Parkinson in good faith that they would not be\r\nmanipulated and they would not be used to break the law. What is so\r\negregious about this is that Darren was made to be personally liable for a\r\ncriminal conspiracy, in my view. It is absolutely outrageous that the\r\namount of emotional trauma that Darren has been put through, watching\r\nhis mental health deteriorate, watching—Dom Cummings and Matthew\r\nElliott encouraged him and eventually convinced him to quit university so\r\nthat he could stay at BrexitCentral.\r\n\r\nI talked to Darren and said, \"You should get out of this because you are\r\nlosing your perspective as to what is happening,\" and I told him I thought\r\nhe was being manipulated, particularly after all of this stuff came out. He\r\nsaid, \"Well, I have already quit university because they told me to quit\r\nuniversity, and what am I going to do? I have no options. Everyone hates\r\nme.\" He told me that he felt trapped. Part of the reason why I am\r\nspeaking out, and part of the reason why Shamir is speaking out, is in\r\nlarge part, irrespective of what you think about Darren's political stance\r\non things, he was a young person who was manipulated and continues to\r\nbe manipulated.\r\n\r\nWhat is so outrageous is that he is the one who is legally liable. He is the\r\none being investigated. It is not Dom Cummings being investigated. It is\r\nnot Stephen Parkinson being investigated. It is not Cleo Watson, also at\r\nDowning Street, being investigated. She was head of Outreach and was\r\nin charge of this programme. It is not Victoria Woodcock, who, two weeks\r\nafter being notified that she was under investigation, goes on to the\r\nshared drive where they were putting all of their advertising, putting all\r\nof their materials, and attempts to delete Dom Cummings, herself and\r\nHenry de Zoete, the head of Digital Vote Leave, after they were notified\r\nthat they were under investigation. It is not them that is being\r\ninvestigated. It is Darren, the 22 year-old intern who had no control over\r\nthat spending and was just told, \"Sign here, sign here\".\r\n\r\nQ1309 Julie Elliott: Do you think these people that you have mentioned—not\r\nDarren; the other people that you have mentioned there—knew that what\r\nthey were doing was in breach of the law?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Vote Leave's lawyers, William Norton, wrote the\r\nconstitution for BeLeave. The entire process was managed by Vote\r\nLeave's lawyers, so BeLeave was set up by Vote Leave's lawyers and the\r\nentire process was managed by Vote Leave's lawyers. As Shahmir has\r\ncommented on before, that created a veneer or a sense that what\r\nBeLeave was doing or what these two young people were doing felt legal\r\nbecause they kept talking to the lawyers, who kept telling them to do this\r\nand that. They just assumed that, \"If the Vote Leave lawyers are telling\r\nus to do this, this must be the proper way to do it.\" This was their first\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\ncampaign. They were volunteers. Although Darren is technically legally\r\nliable for what happened, morally I don't fault him.\r\n\r\nQ1310 Julie Elliott: If we put Darren to one side, do you think that Dominic\r\nCummings and all of these other people that you are talking about knew\r\nthat what was being done was not on the right side of the law?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Why did Victoria Woodcock, two weeks after being\r\nnotified that they were under investigation, go on to a shared drive that\r\nVote Leave set up and try to delete herself, Dom Cummings and Henry\r\nde Zoete? Why did that happen after being notified that they were under\r\ninvestigation?\r\n\r\nChair: We can speculate on that now. Ultimately, this is a matter for the\r\nElectoral Commission, and if an offence has been committed, they will\r\nrecommend action is taken against the individuals concerned.\r\n\r\nQ1311 Simon Hart: It is almost irrelevant to what you were just saying, but\r\nlet's assume for a minute that the assertions you make are right. Have\r\nyou or anybody else made any assessment of whether any of this made\r\nmuch difference to the final outcome of the EU referendum?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Okay, two points on that. The first point is when you\r\nare caught in the Olympics doping, there is not a debate about how much\r\nillegal drug you took or, \"Well, he probably would have come in first\r\nanyway,\" or, \"He only took half of the amount.\" It does not matter. If you\r\nare caught cheating, you lose your medal, because if we allow cheating in\r\nour democratic process and we allow this amount, what about next time?\r\nWhat about the time after that? This is a breach of the law. This is\r\ncheating. The thing that is important to understand here is that this is not\r\nsome council race or a by-election; this is an irreversible change to the\r\nconstitutional settlement of this country. First of all, that is why it\r\nmatters. If you cheat on an exam, you get a fail. If you cheat on the\r\nOlympics, you lose your medal. You should not win by cheating, first\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe second point, to the actual substance of your question, Dom\r\nCummings himself says that this is what won Brexit for them. He says,\r\n\"AIQ. They could not have won without AIQ,\" and it speaks volumes to\r\nthe fact that they spent 40% of their budget on AIQ. Having seen the\r\neffectiveness of the conversion rates on the online ads that AIQ puts out,\r\nthey are incredibly effective. They are incredibly effective. When you look\r\nat online adverts, you can get programmes with a conversion rate of 1%\r\nor 2%. A conversion, just so that people are aware, is not just somebody\r\nseeing an ad and not only just seeing an ad and then clicking on the ad;\r\nit is clicking on the ad and then performing an action. That is what the\r\ndefinition of a conversion is: filling out a form; giving an email.\r\n\r\nQ1312 Simon Hart: Are you going as far as saying that had these institutions\r\nnot cheated, in your words, the outcome of the referendum might have\r\nbeen different? Is that what you are saying, or is that what Dom\r\nCummings was saying?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: I think it is completely reasonable to say that there\r\ncould have been a different outcome in the referendum had there not\r\nbeen, in my view, cheating.\r\n\r\nQ1313 Chair: I want to clarify a few things we have been discussing in this\r\nsection. You have used the term \"franchise operation\". It seems like a\r\nkind of mafia-style franchise operation of these different entities—we\r\nhave focused on three; there could be many more—that are technically\r\nindependent of each other but they are totally reliant on each other as\r\nwell; their businesses are reliant on each other. If there is one entity, do\r\nyou think there is one person who is responsible for that entity?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: As in who is responsible for the whole web of\r\nthings?\r\n\r\nChair: Yes. If it is a franchise, ultimately there is a co-ordinator of that\r\nfranchise. There is someone whose IP that franchise is.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: When I was there that was Alexander Nix and Steve\r\nBannon, but that is a question you should be asking AIQ.\r\n\r\nQ1314 Chair: In regards to AIQ and the data in GSR, the Aleksandr Kogan data,\r\ndo you believe that all the companies would have had access to that data\r\nthat was gathered as well? Would that have been accessible to AIQ, to\r\nCambridge Analytica, to anyone who was working as part of this\r\nfranchise?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes, absolutely. It is farcical to say that AIQ did not\r\nhave access to the Facebook data when they were building the software\r\nthat deployed it. You can't do online targeting if you do not have access\r\nto the database. You can't.\r\n\r\nQ1315 Brendan O'Hara: One question, looking back slightly, you talked about\r\nthe AIQ conversion rates: what were those conversion rates? You said\r\nthey were significant or more than significant. What were they? Can you\r\nquantify them?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Obviously it depends on the programme and the\r\nadvert, so there is not one hard and fast rule. I have seen conversion\r\nrates at 5%, 7%, which does not sounds like a lot, but in online\r\nadvertising that is a very effective programme because, again, the\r\nconversion is not just somebody seeing the ad or even clicking on it. It is\r\nthem going and performing an action and signing up, donating,\r\nperforming a substantive action or coming and attending an event—so,\r\nperforming a substantive action. On online ads, a lot of programmes that\r\nI have seen will get conversions of 1% or 2%. I saw one programme that\r\nthey had, which had 10%—that was insane—but they had substantially\r\nhigher conversion rates, at least on the American projects that I worked\r\non.\r\n\r\nI have not seen the work intimately that they did on Brexit, but they\r\nfocused their effort. AIQ did not just advertise to everybody in the\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\ncountry. They focused their effort on 5 million to 7 million people who\r\nwere the core universe that, if you could turn out these people, then you\r\ncan win. What they told me is that they did not advertise to everyone in\r\nthe country. They took a very specific sliver of the country in a very\r\ncalculated way that they needed in order to win and they just blasted\r\nthem with ads. You could find out because Facebook would have that\r\ninformation, Google would have that information.\r\n\r\nQ1316 Brendan O'Hara: You say that 5%, 7%, up to 10% is absolutely\r\nunprecedented in terms of—\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Again, for substantive actions like giving £20,\r\nsigning up and going to an event, becoming a member, whatever that\r\nsubstantive action is, that is a really good conversion rate for people that\r\nyou have never spoken to before. I am not talking about retargeting. I\r\nam talking about fresh people that you have never spoken to before but if\r\nyou target it in an effective way— if you think about it, if you get a 5% to\r\n7% conversion rate and you target several hundred thousand people and\r\neach of those people gives £10, if you count that as the substantive\r\naction, or joins and becomes a member or attends an event, that action,\r\nwhen you scale it, becomes quite impactful.\r\n\r\nQ1317 Brendan O'Hara: Can I ask you about the relationship between\r\nCambridge Analytica and Global Science Research? What was that\r\nrelationship, as you understand it? What did they do?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: GSR is Kogan's company. There were several\r\niterations of the Facebook harvesting project. It first started as a very\r\nsmall pilot, firstly to see, most simply, is this data matchable to an\r\nelectoral register? One of the concerns was if you just collect somebody\r\nnamed John Smith, that could be anybody, so can you match that to this\r\nJohn Smith, on this street, in this city. We then scaled out slightly to\r\nmake sure that he could acquire data in the speed that he said that he\r\ncould. The first real pilot of it was a sample of 10,000 people who joined\r\nthe app. That was in late May 2014. That project went really well, and\r\nthat is when we signed a much larger contract with GSR in the first week\r\nof June—I cannot remember the specific date but the first week of June\r\n2014—where the app went out and collected surveys and people joining\r\napps throughout the summer of 2014. That ended up leading to the 50—\r\nthe 50 million number is what the media has felt safest to report,\r\nbecause of the documentation that they can rely on, but my recollection\r\nis that it is substantially higher than that. My own view is that it was\r\nmuch more than 50 million, but in terms of the relationship, there was a\r\ncontractual relationship between the companies. Is that the—\r\n\r\nQ1318 Brendan O'Hara: Yes. I just wanted to follow on. Now that we have\r\nestablished that there was this contractual relationship, from Cambridge\r\nAnalytica's perspective, was that a useful relationship with GSR?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: From Cambridge Analytica's perspective?\r\n\r\nBrendan O'Hara: Yes.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Incredibly. This is what built the company. This was\r\nthe foundational dataset that then was modelled to create the algorithms.\r\nThat was a very important relationship.\r\n\r\nQ1319 Brendan O'Hara: The reason I ask that is because on 27 February,\r\nwhen Alexander Nix was here, he was asked, \"Does any of your data\r\ncome from Global Science Research?\" to which he replied, \"We had a\r\nrelationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That\r\nresearch proved to be fruitless so the answer is no\". The Chair then said,\r\n\"They have not supplied you with any data or information?\" Mr Nix\r\nreplied, \"No\". The Chair said, \"Your datasets are not based with\r\ninformation you have received from them?\" He said, \"No, not at all\".\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Million-dollar contracts. All I would say to that is,\r\n\"Well, why did you spend the better part of $1 million on GSR? Why are\r\nthere copious amounts of emails?\" I have passed on to the Committee\r\nthe contractual documents, the invoicing, the match rates of that data,\r\nemails about that data. That is just not true. It is just not true. Sorry, it is\r\nnot true.\r\n\r\nQ1320 Brendan O'Hara: You described or you have been quoted as saying that\r\nCambridge Analytica, \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of\r\npeople's profiles and built models to exploit what we knew about them\r\nand target their inner demons\". Could you explain a little bit further what\r\nthat means and even give a practical example of what that would have\r\nmeant?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: When you are looking at psychological disposition—\r\nno one is a perfectly rational agent. What in part makes us human is our\r\nirrationality, otherwise we would all be just robots. Different people have\r\ndifferent dispositional attributes—so, different personality traits, different\r\ndegrees of mental heuristics or biases. For example, if you are able to\r\ncreate profiling algorithms that can predict certain traits—let's say a high\r\ndegree of openness and a high degree of neuroticism—and when you look\r\nat that profile, it is the profile of a person who is more prone to\r\nconspiratorial thinking, for example. They are open enough to connect to\r\nthings that may not seem reasonable to your average person and they\r\nare anxious enough or impulsive enough to start clicking and reading and\r\nlooking at things.\r\n\r\nIf you can create a psychological profile of a type of person who is more\r\nprone to adopting certain forms of ideas, conspiracies for example, and\r\nyou can identify what that person looks like in data terms, you can then\r\ngo out and predict how likely somebody is going to be to adopt more\r\nconspiratorial messaging and then advertise or target them with blogs or\r\nwebsites or what everyone now calls fake news, so that they start seeing\r\nall of these ideas or all of these stories around them in their digital\r\nenvironment. They do not see it when they watch CNN or NBC or BBC,\r\nand they start to go, \"Well, why is it that everyone is talking about this\r\nonline? Why is it that I'm seeing everything here but the mainstream\r\nmedia isn't talking about how Obama has moved a battalion into Texas\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nbecause he's planning on staying for a third term? I keep seeing that\r\neverywhere, but why isn't the mainstream media talking about that?\"\r\n\r\nNot everyone is going to adopt that, so the advantage of using profiling is\r\nthat you can find the specific group of people who are more prone to\r\nadopting that idea as your early adopters. If you think about it in terms\r\nof trends, all trends start with a group of people who adopt something\r\nearly. If you can find those people in your datasets, because you know\r\nwhat they look like in terms of data, you can catalyse a trend over time,\r\nbut you first need to find what those people look like. Does that—\r\n\r\nQ1321 Brendan O'Hara: Yes. Was that tactic routinely used by SCL or\r\nCambridge Analytica? Was that one of the tools in the armoury that was\r\nroutinely used?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes. The basis of a lot of our research was: how far\r\ncan we go with certain types of people, and who is it that we would need\r\nto target with what types of messaging?\r\n\r\nQ1322 Brendan O'Hara: In accessing that data or getting your hands on that\r\ndata, did Cambridge Analytica or SCL approach GSR or was it the other\r\nway round? Were they approached by GSR?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes. I have had this question quite a bit. It is sort of\r\na bit of both, because we were already working with several professors at\r\nCambridge. The first point that I would say is that GSR became a\r\ncompany simply to service Cambridge Analytica. GSR did not pre-exist.\r\nWe were already working with a lot of professors—just ad hoc consulting\r\nand that sort of thing—at Cambridge, which is how we got introduced to\r\nKogan. It was not as direct as, \"I sought out Kogan,\" or, \"CA sought out\r\nKogan,\" and it was not that Kogan sought out us. It was just the fact that\r\nwe were engaging a lot of the same people and it was just through that\r\ninteraction that we started talking.\r\n\r\nThe first profs that we started working with were David Stillwell and\r\nMichal Kosinski, but the reason we stopped working with them was\r\nbecause Michal Kosinski at the time was the deputy director of the\r\npsychometric centre, and once he found out how much money we had,\r\nhe asked for $500,000 and 50% royalties, which he sent in an email. I\r\nhave also provided that to the Committee. It was not feasible on an\r\nexperimental project to make that kind of commitment. It was Kogan\r\nwho then came and said, \"Well, I could do it. As long as you pay for the\r\ndata and pay for costs, we can do it and figure out some kind of\r\ncommercial deal after so let's just see if this works.\" That is why Kogan\r\nultimately was selected to be the person to provide those services,\r\nbecause Dr Kosinski wanted $500,000 and 50% royalties.\r\n\r\nQ1323 Brendan O'Hara: Do you know how much Cambridge Analytica paid\r\nGSR for the data?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: It depends on what you mean by \"paid for\". The\r\nway the project ran for the most part was SCL—because remember all\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nthe accounts are SCL, so when I say CA and SCL I am talking about is\r\neffectively the same thing. It was technically SCL accounts that were\r\npaying for it. SCL would pay for the invoicing to Qualtrics or MTurk, which\r\nwere survey responder recruitment platforms. SCL would pay for that\r\ndirectly. Not that much money was passed through GSR. It was just paid\r\ndirectly to Qualtrics or Amazon MTurk and so on.\r\n\r\nGSR was paid money, because in order to make a valid contract you need\r\nconsideration. They did receive £3.14 or pi pounds as the contract fee,\r\nbut most of the money that was spent went directly to pay for costs\r\nrather than pay Kogan when I was there. I know that Kogan stayed\r\naround longer with SCL after I left, so I am not sure at that point if he\r\nmade a commercial deal or not with SCL, but when I was there it was\r\npredominantly just a research project.\r\n\r\nThe deal was that he could keep all the data and do research or whatever\r\nhe wanted to do with it. For him it was appealing because you had a\r\ncompany that was the equivalent of— no academic grant could compete\r\nwith the amount of money that we could spend on it, and also we did not\r\nhave to go through all the compliance stuff that you have to do with\r\nacademic grants and all the reporting and all of that, so we could literally\r\njust start next week and pay for whatever you want. My impression at\r\nthe time was that for an academic that would have been quite appealing.\r\n\r\nQ1324 Brendan O'Hara: Much of the attention, quite rightly, is on Cambridge\r\nAnalytica at the moment. Do you know if there are other data analytics\r\ncompanies out there who are operating in the same way?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: When I first joined SCL, one of the very first emails\r\nI got was asking me about a company called Palantir. I am not sure if\r\npeople are familiar with Palantir, but it is a private contractor. Its largest\r\nclient is the NSA. It also works for GCHQ. Alexander Nix was very\r\ninterested in the work that Palantir did, in part because Sophie Schmidt,\r\nwho is the daughter of Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google, worked for\r\nAlexander Nix before I came on board and introduced him to Palantir.\r\nWhen I came on, one of the very first questions was, \"Can we do\r\nsomething with Palantir? Can we do something with Palantir? What do\r\nyou think about Palantir?\" We had several meetings with Palantir while I\r\nwas there, and some of the documentation I have also provided to the\r\nCommittee— and there is more documentation that I still need to provide\r\nyou on this. There were senior Palantir employees who were also working\r\non the Facebook data.\r\n\r\nCan I clarify one point? That was not an official contract between Palantir\r\nand Cambridge Analytica, but there were Palantir staff who would come\r\ninto the office and work on the data, and we would go and meet with\r\nPalantir staff at Palantir. Just to clarify, Palantir did not officially contract\r\nwith Cambridge Analytica, but there were Palantir staff who helped build\r\nthe models that we were working on.\r\n\r\nQ1325 Rebecca Pow: It was something you mentioned earlier, Christopher, and\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nI wondered if it is related to some of the things my colleague has just\r\nreferred to. You mentioned that in the elections around the world that\r\nthese various companies, AIQ in particular, had been involved with, one\r\nof the main influences and the main way they made money was through\r\n\"influence brokering\". Could you explain what that is? I am asking\r\nwhether there is a more sinister side to this. This is not just about\r\ninfluence in affecting elections and the kick of the academic side. Is there\r\na more sinister moneymaking side linked to all of this that we have not\r\nyet uncovered?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes. You don't make a ton of money working on\r\npolitics, particularly in a small island nation, for example, but that island\r\nnation may have oil reserves or minerals or lax labour laws that can be\r\nexploited by companies, or could have lax labour laws if those laws were\r\npassed. Part of the business model of SCL is to capture a Government—\r\nso, win an election. You get paid for that, but you do not make a ton of\r\nmoney; where you make money is then going to the Minister and\r\nintroducing the Minister to a company and then making deals. There were\r\ndifferent companies that were interested in building new ports or things\r\nlike that, and in order to get a competitive advantage, if some money\r\ngoes here and some money goes here and you can introduce the Minister\r\nand if the minister then approves the project, you get a cut of that deal.\r\n\r\nWhen I was there, it was not just selling influence from a company to a\r\nGovernment. Often they would use fake Government projects to also help\r\nsupport the political aims of the Minister. For example, Alexander Nix met\r\nwith the Minister for health of Ghana and offered essentially to provide\r\nher with a large degree of political and campaign services, but they would\r\nbill it through the Ministry of Health as a health research programme, and\r\nso they approved that. I have also sent documentation to the Committee\r\non this.\r\n\r\nQ1326 Rebecca Pow: Can I just stop you? Earlier you referred to some of these\r\nvery wealthy people involved in these companies. Do you think this is\r\nwhat their driving force is—that they can be big power players on the\r\nworld stage?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes. You can be like a colonial master in a country.\r\nSorry, not to sound flippant about it, but it felt very much like a\r\nprivatised colonising operation. You would go into a country that has\r\nunderdeveloped civic institutions, exploit that and make money off it.\r\nThey make a lot of their money through exploiting relationships and,\r\nbecause there is not a lot of oversight and Government accountability in a\r\nlot of these countries, it is very easy to make money off that. The key\r\nthing is you have to have your guy in power first.\r\n\r\nQ1327 Giles Watling: You have told us some pretty horrendous stories,\r\nparticularly about the political situation in Nigeria, working on things\r\nthere, and you have told us that Cambridge Analytica does not have staff,\r\nyet you worked for Cambridge Analytica. Were you employed by SCL?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: I was paid for by SCL. Yes, I worked for Cambridge\r\nAnalytica, as does everybody. Everybody works for Cambridge Analytica\r\nbut they are paid for by SOCIAL, and I started before Cambridge\r\nAnalytica even existed.\r\n\r\nQ1328 Giles Watling: Cambridge Analytica came along and that relationship,\r\nwhich you have so eloquently described, started and, in effect, you were\r\nworking for Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nYou have talked about all those malevolent influences that have been\r\nexposed in Nigeria and so on, and you are working for these people. You\r\nsigned, as you said, a non-disclosure agreement with Cambridge\r\nAnalytica; is that right?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: With SCL.\r\n\r\nQ1329 Giles Watling: With SCL. Now you have decided to go whistleblower on\r\nall this, are you under any threats? Is anything happening? What is\r\nhappening in your world?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Do you know what is interesting? The most legal\r\npushback that I got was not from Cambridge Analytica; it was from\r\nFacebook. It is Facebook who is most upset about this story.\r\n\r\nQ1330 Giles Watling: How does that materialise? Are they threatening legal\r\naction or—\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: They have sent some fairly intimidating legal\r\ncorrespondence. They have not taken action on that, I think. I am not\r\nsure exactly what they are planning. They just have gone silent. They will\r\nnot talk to me anymore.\r\n\r\nQ1331 Giles Watling: You are just left out in the cold now, is it?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes. But I do anticipate at some point some robust\r\npushback from Cambridge Analytica, because this is an existential crisis\r\nfor them. I think that I have a fairly robust public interest defence to\r\nbreaking that NDA and that undertaking of confidentiality.\r\n\r\nQ1332 Giles Watling: You say that the Donald Trump thing was not the actual\r\ncrossing of the line, but it was the final straw on the camel's back when\r\nyou decided to turn whistleblower?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: It made it the most salient in my mind, as in, it was\r\nno longer this niche shady firm. It was a firm that was making a massive\r\nimpact on the world, so it made it much more salient in my mind.\r\n\r\nQ1333 Giles Watling: Was your move dictated by morality, questions of\r\nmorality, or illegality?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: It is a process of coming to terms with what you\r\nhave created and the impact that that has had. I am incredibly\r\nremorseful for my role in setting it up, and I am the first person to say\r\nthat I should have known better, but what is done is done.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ1334 Giles Watling: It was not a road to Damascus thing. It was a gradual\r\nrealisation that, \"What I am doing here is amoral.\" Is that how you felt?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes. It was not a sudden \"Aha!\" moment. I knew\r\nthat I was growing really uncomfortable with working at the firm for a\r\nwhole slew of reasons, but I did not report the firm because they kept\r\nthreatening to sue me and I had signed not just an NDA, but there was\r\nthe additional undertaking of confidence. It is very intimidating to go up\r\nagainst an American billionaire who is threatening to sue you into\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at, for example, Carole Cadwalladr's reporting in The\r\nGuardian, there has been a lot of attention on me because I have become\r\nthe face of it, because I am the one who has come forward and put my\r\nname to it, but she has 12 or 15 other sources that she has talked to.\r\nEven now, with CA being exposed and the future of the company is in\r\nquestion as to whether it will still be a company in a couple of months,\r\npeople do not want to come forward because that is how intimidating\r\nAlexander Nix is. That is how intimidating Steve Bannon is. That is how\r\nintimidating Robert Mercer is. Also, when you look at—\r\n\r\nQ1335 Giles Watling: You find yourself in the vanguard of it. I put it to you: do\r\nyou want to bring these companies down? Is that how you feel about it?\r\nYou are angry; I have seen your emotion.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Frankly, yes, because nothing good has come from\r\nCambridge Analytica. It is not a legitimate business. SCL is not a\r\nlegitimate business. Yes, I don't think that they should remain in\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nQ1336 Giles Watling: That clears up your motivation. Can I move on to\r\nCambridge Analytica? Do you know when Facebook first knew that its\r\ndata had been passed to Cambridge Analytica? Do you have any idea\r\nwhen that happened?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: I know it sounds like a simple question, but it is a\r\nhard one to answer because I have heard different things from different\r\npeople and all of them are plausible. I remember when—and I think this\r\nwas around July 2014—Kogan was delayed for a couple of days because\r\nFacebook had throttled the app, so that it could not pull as much data.\r\nThere was some problem with pulling as much data at the same speed as\r\nbefore. He told me that he had a conversation with some engineers at\r\nFacebook. I was not in those conversations. This is what he told me at\r\nthe time. Facebook would have known from that moment about the\r\nproject, because he had a conversation with Facebook's engineers, or at\r\nleast that is what he told me. I do not know if that is entirely true or not,\r\nbut that is what he told me.\r\n\r\nFacebook's account of it is that they had no idea until The Guardian first\r\nreported it at the end of 2015 and then they sent letters to me in August\r\n2016 asking, \"Do you know where this data might be or was it deleted?\"\r\nThe date of the letter is the same month that Cambridge Analytica\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nofficially joined the Trump campaign, so I am not sure if Facebook was\r\ngenuinely concerned about the data or just the optics of, \"Okay, now this\r\nfirm is not just some random firm in Britain. It is now working for a\r\npresidential campaign.\"\r\n\r\nQ1337 Giles Watling: You said an interesting thing there. You said, \"where this\r\ndata might be\". Data is not stuff that you pick up and move. It spreads\r\nbut it remains in its source position.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes. It is completely fungible in the sense that you\r\ncan copy it a million times, it can go anywhere and—\r\n\r\nQ1338 Giles Watling: It is how far it has spread.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: It is often impossible to ascertain where did the\r\ndata go or where is it or how much of it is—\r\n\r\nQ1339 Giles Watling: Do you know if Facebook ever made any efforts to\r\nretrieve data, to delete data?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: No, they did not. That is my knowledge. They\r\ncertainly didn't with me until after I went public and then they made me\r\nsuspect number one, despite the fact that the ICO wrote to me and to\r\nFacebook saying that I have given over everything to the authorities. I\r\nsuspect that when Facebook looked at what happened in 2016, they\r\nwent, \"Well, if we make a big deal of this, this might be optically not the\r\nbest thing to make a big fuss about.\"\r\n\r\nGiles Watling: A PR thing.\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: Yes. If you saw what happened last week, it was a\r\nbig deal. I do not think they pushed it in part because if you want to\r\ninvestigate a large data breach, that is going to get out and that might\r\ncause problems. My impression is they have sort of wanted to push it\r\nunder the rug.\r\n\r\nQ1340 Giles Watling: To put it in a nutshell, it was not in Facebook's interest to\r\npursue the large data breach?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: No, because when you look at what this firm was\r\nalso doing, you had Professor Kogan, who was managing the acquisition\r\nof this data, going back and forth to Russia, working on Russian-funded\r\nprojects—which, by the way, CA pitched to other clients. They knew what\r\nhe was doing in Russia.\r\n\r\nQ1341 Giles Watling: Was that you pitching?\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: No, it was not me pitching it. I have sent you copies\r\nof emails where other people at the company are deciding to put it into a\r\npitch for other clients. You had all kinds of people having access to the\r\ndata. Staff at Palantir had access to the data; all kinds of people had\r\naccess to the data.\r\n\r\nQ1342 Giles Watling: It was not locked down. It was everywhere.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChristopher Wylie: It was everywhere, yes.\r\n\r\nPaul-Olivier Dehaye: If I may add something, when Harry Davies, the\r\njournalist at The Guardian, published an article in December 2015, that is\r\nthe moment where the story became a public story or started becoming a\r\npublic story. That is also my entry point into this. He has just published\r\nan article in The Guardian, yesterday or the day, before explaining the\r\ngenesis of that article for him. Apparently he knew of improprieties\r\naround data flows outside of Facebook a few months after it happened—\r\nsomething like, I am guessing, around October 2014, let's say. He\r\nstarted investigating, but he did not know where the data was going—he\r\ndid not know what the use was and so on. It was only later, because he\r\ngot a tip that Cruz was working with Cambridge Analytica, that he\r\nconnected the dots and later published his article in December 2015,\r\nmuch later.\r\n\r\nMy point is that at the time—you will have to ask him, but somewhere\r\nbetween October 2014 and a few months later maybe—he started talking\r\nto Facebook and asking Facebook questions about this data.

Lucas; Christian Matheson; Brendan O'Hara; Jo\r\nStevens; Giles Watling.\r\n\r\nQuestions 1462-1769\r\n\r\nWitness\r\n\r\nI: Brittany Kaiser, former Director of Program Development, Cambridge\r\nAnalytica.\r\n\r\nExamination of witness\r\n\r\nWitness: Brittany Kaiser.\r\n\r\nQ1462 Chair: Good morning. Welcome to this further session of the Digital,\r\nCulture, Media and Sport Select Committee as part of our ongoing\r\ninvestigation into disinformation and fake news. I am very pleased to\r\nwelcome Brittany Kaiser to give evidence to the Committee this morning.\r\nBrittany has also supplied the Committee with some written evidence,\r\nwhich we have formally agreed to publish and is now available on the\r\nCommittee website. It includes Brittany Kaiser's written statement and\r\nsome other supporting documents. There are also some emails which\r\nBritany Kaiser has given to us. We need to do a bit of work on those to\r\nremove some of the personal data that is contained in that document,\r\ngiving personal email addresses and the like. We have agreed that we will\r\npublish those emails separately as soon as we have had the chance to\r\nprepare them and put them in a format where we can publish them. The\r\nbulk of that written evidence is now available for people to view online. I\r\nam sure we will be referring to that evidence and the emails during the\r\ncourse of our discussions this morning.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of the Committee and the record, Brittany Kaiser, can you\r\ngive us an insight into how you came to work for Cambridge Analytica\r\nand SCL and the way in which the company was structured and work was\r\nconducted through those companies?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course, good morning, Chairman and hon. Members.\r\nFirstly, I want to thank you for this opportunity to bear witness to the\r\ninquiry on fake news. As a believer in truth, universal human rights and\r\ndemocracy, I understand that fake news undermines these ideals and\r\nmuch of what we stand for and hold dear. It is evidence of a much deeper\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nWe have spent too many years using technology to take advantage of\r\npeople's openness and good will, and I will not stand by any longer to\r\nobserve this privileged abuse of power, intentionally or unintentionally. I\r\nwant to help shed light in these dark places and to help people be more\r\nresponsible in their actions, which is why I spoke out originally and why I\r\nhave returned to the UK willingly and at my own expense to give\r\ntestimony to this inquiry.\r\n\r\nShort background about myself: I was born in Houston, Texas and raised\r\nin Chicago. I went to high school at Phillips Academy, Andover outside\r\nBoston before moving to the United Kingdom to attend Edinburgh\r\nUniversity to pursue some of my life-long passions: human rights and\r\ninternational relations. During my academic studies I volunteered on the\r\npresidential campaigns of Howard Dean and John Kerry, as well as the\r\nsenatorial campaign of then State Senator Barack Obama, before later\r\njoining a small new media team on his presidential campaign, which is of\r\nnote because as part of that team I was part of the first-time use of social\r\nmedia in political communications.\r\n\r\nI spent several years working on human rights projects around the world,\r\nfirst for Amnesty International, and then lobbying at the United Nations\r\nand the European Parliament, specifically on stopping crimes against\r\nhumanity and abuses of power.\r\n\r\nQ1463 Chair: Sorry, if I can stop you there, I appreciate that background detail;\r\na lot of it is included in your written statement, which we have read and\r\npublished as well. I think we can probably move on to your starting work\r\nat Cambridge Analytica and your work there.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course. I first met Alexander Nix when I was working\r\nfor Democrats Abroad in London—I think it was 2013. Friends of ours\r\nthought it would be a good joke to introduce us, as he was consulting for\r\nthe Republican party, while I was a registered Democrat—I still am today.\r\nHe was very interested in learning more about my experience with the\r\nDemocrats, as he was running a political consultancy, which was very well\r\nknown at the time. He gave me his card and said, \"Let me get you drunk\r\nand steal your secrets.\" I did not call him at the time. But we met\r\ncoincidentally a few more times after that, and in December 2014 he\r\noffered me a job. I wanted to find a way to be more effective in\r\ncampaigning and in social change projects. His firm, Strategic\r\nCommunication Laboratories—the SCL Group—boasted of scientifically\r\nvalid methods of measuring effectiveness in communications. I have\r\nalways wanted to use this power for good, not ill. The first project I\r\nworked on with SCL was designing a communications campaign to drive\r\nengagement with the reconstruction of Ebola-stricken countries.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nI began with the SCL Group on a part-time basis in December 2014. My\r\njob title was left to me. I called myself \"special adviser\". I later became a\r\nfull-time employee in February 2015. My title was \"director of business\r\ndevelopment\". As a person who is really an over-glorified salesgirl, these\r\ntitles tend to be slightly inflated. I was later called \"director of business\r\ndevelopment\" at the request of my superiors.\r\n\r\nQ1464 Chair: When you were employed at Cambridge Analytica, were you\r\nemployed as a staff contractor or as a consultant?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was a consultant when I first started and then I was a\r\nfull-time permanent employee from February 2015.\r\n\r\nQ1465 Chair: Okay, so from a UK basis you paid income tax through the\r\ncompany and you were on a regular full-time contract?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, until January of this year.\r\n\r\nQ1466 Chair: In January, did you leave the company completely, or did you\r\nleave your full-time role but continue to do some part-time or\r\nconsultancy work for them?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I left my full-time role at the company, hoping to come\r\non as a consultant and we were not able to agree anything, so I have not\r\nbeen paid or been a part of the company since January.\r\n\r\nQ1467 Chair: So you have not received any money at all from them since\r\nJanuary?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No.\r\n\r\nQ1468 Chair: In terms of your change of status from a full-time role, that ended\r\nin January, while you sought to explore working as a consultant. That\r\nultimately went nowhere and you were not working on any projects at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That is correct. At no time was I part of the executive\r\nleadership or top management of the SCL Group or Cambridge Analytica,\r\nalthough I wanted to be. I really believe that I contributed hugely to the\r\nsuccess of the company. I was never an officer of the board of any of the\r\ncompanies. I was also not a data scientist and never had access to any\r\ndata sets, let alone the controversial data sets I hope to explore today.\r\nSince I left, I have been learning just how many secrets the management\r\nteam was keeping me out of—looking back with fresh eyes at the emails I\r\nwas copied into and other documents with the benefit of hindsight.\r\n\r\nMy job at Cambridge Analytica was primarily to meet potential clients,\r\nhear what they wanted and required, and then to brief the operations\r\nteam in order to produce a sales proposal, often under the guidance of\r\nsenior management and executives, such as CEO Alexander Nix, CFO and\r\nCOO Julian Wheatland, and chief data officer, Dr Alexander Taylor. I had\r\naccess to company materials on products and services, the account\r\nmanagement in those teams and data on potential and current clients. My\r\ntestimony today is informed by what I witnessed and experienced during\r\nmy time at Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group, and materials I\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nworked on or was copied into. When I originally spoke to The Guardian in\r\nMarch of this year, I provided relevant documents from my Cambridge\r\nAnalytica inbox, which I was subsequently locked out of. But I later found\r\nan offline copy of my SCL Group inbox, with further materials that have\r\nbeen provided to the Committee today.\r\n\r\nQ1469 Chair: Thank you very much for that. Could you explain a little about the\r\nway in which SCL works as a group of companies? We have had some\r\nevidence that everything is SCL and that Cambridge Analytica is really\r\njust a fascia—that no one really works for it, everyone works for SCL. It\r\nis just another brass plate behind which work is done, and there are lots\r\nof other entities like that. Is that a fair reflection, based on your\r\nexperience, of how the company works?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was never privy to the full company structure, perhaps\r\nfor reasons that have now become known to the Committee. But it was my\r\nunderstanding when I joined the SCL Group that it was a parent company\r\nof a few different divisions. One would be SCL Commercial, SCL Elections,\r\nSCL Defence, SCL Social, and then Cambridge Analytica, which I\r\nunderstood was the US-acting subsidiary that was created with new\r\ninvestment in order to explore advanced data science methods.\r\n\r\nQ1470 Chair: Would you say that your sense of the organisation was that it was\r\neffectively one organisation that had different divisions that worked on\r\ndifferent projects?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, most staff were shared between the companies. I\r\ndon't believe that anyone was even ever employed directly by Cambridge\r\nAnalytica. We had another subsidiary called SCL USA, which was the\r\ncontracting entity in the United States.\r\n\r\nQ1471 Chair: What can you tell us about Emerdata? Is that a new project being\r\nfunded through SCL or is it something completely different?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: The first time I heard the word Emerdata was in the\r\npress. I believe that that was in relation to the private raise that my\r\nexecutives were undertaking for investment, which was closed in January.\r\nThey created a new holding company structure. I never knew what the\r\nname of that structure was until I saw that in the press. I do assume that\r\nwas the same entity that I had heard about.\r\n\r\nQ1472 Chair: Do you believe it was a new vehicle through which they were\r\nraising money in order to launch new businesses? Would that be fair?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I thought it was specifically to invest in the development\r\nof Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group.\r\n\r\nQ1473 Chair: Could you tell us a little about where else in the world you have\r\nworked? We may later have some more detailed questions about specific\r\nareas, but could you just give us a sense of which countries that you\r\nhave worked in or that you know SCL worked in during your time there?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: The only countries that I worked in for Cambridge\r\nAnalytica were the United Kingdom, the United States and Mexico. I\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nworked on projects in other countries, or on winning contracts for those\r\nprojects in countries in Asia, eastern Europe and Latin America, but I was\r\nnever physically present as part of the campaign team, due to the nature\r\nof my business development role.\r\n\r\nQ1474 Chair: Can you say which specific countries?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course. First, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Lithuania, Malaysia; I\r\nhave already said Mexico. Most other places were a pitch, where I don't\r\nbelieve that I contributed to work that was ever really undertaken.\r\nEthiopia was also just a pitch, not work that was undertaken. I did spend\r\nquite a long time on commercial business development in the United\r\nStates, which was my main focus for the latter half of my time with the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nQ1475 Chair: Did you work in Malta?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No.\r\n\r\nQ1476 Chair: Are you aware that Cambridge Analytica or SCL worked in Malta?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, sir.\r\n\r\nQ1477 Chair: Or Israel?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, sir.\r\n\r\nQ1478 Chair: People have asked whether there was work done with Germany.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Oh. I was part of preparing a pitch with Germany for\r\npolitical work, which was never undertaken, and for a variety of\r\ncommercial projects, some of which were contracted for.\r\n\r\nQ1479 Chair: Who was that pitch directed to?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: The CDU.\r\n\r\nQ1480 Chair: To the CDU?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1481 Chair: And in France? Was there any work related to the French\r\npresidential election?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I did go there with Alexander Nix—I can't remember; it\r\nmust have been in 2015 at some point—to explore partnering with a\r\nconsultancy firm there. In the end, similar to Germany, they said that\r\nusing data for political communications was not advisable in that work.\r\n\r\nQ1482 Chair: Or legal.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: They were not interested in pursuing further work\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nQ1483 Chair: Was it advisable or legal, in their words?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: They said that if the use of data—which was legal—in a\r\nvariety of different ways for political communications after an opt-in were\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nfound out by the press, they would probably lose business over that, and\r\nwere not interested in putting at risk the rest of their work that they were\r\nalready undertaking.\r\n\r\nQ1484 Chair: But as you know, under European data protection law there are\r\nalready quite strict rules around holding data relating to people's political\r\naffiliations and opinions. There are restrictions on doing that outside\r\npolitical parties.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1485 Chair: I'm sure you saw the Channel 4 investigation into Cambridge\r\nAnalytica, or had the chance to watch it on catch-up. They talk about\r\nghosting in and out of countries: setting up shadow companies and then\r\nclosing them down after elections. Does that tally with your experience?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, not at all. It is incredibly shocking how far\r\nsometimes a sales pitch could go through to suggesting things that I\r\nbelieve are illegal or at least quite shadowy. I have never heard most of\r\nwhat was uttered on those videos ever before in any meeting that I have\r\nbeen a part of, nor was I aware or had any inkling that that might have\r\nbeen suggested when I was not present.\r\n\r\nQ1486 Julie Elliott: You mentioned eastern Europe in passing. That came out in\r\nthe Channel 4 recording. What work are you aware of that was done in\r\nthe Czech Republic?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was not a part of any pitches in the Czech Republic. I\r\ndo remember it maybe being mentioned in a sales call once but I was not\r\na part of that.\r\n\r\nQ1487 Julie Elliott: But are you aware that Cambridge Analytica were working\r\nin the Czech Republic?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Were we? I have no idea. Sorry about that.\r\n\r\nQ1488 Julie Elliott: So you wouldn't know who they would be working for\r\nthere?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No.\r\n\r\nQ1489 Julie Elliott: The other place that I am interested in is Argentina. Are\r\nyou aware of any work that was done in Argentina?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: The first commercial project I was ever aware of was in\r\nArgentina for an agricultural company that was mostly communications\r\nand branding. I also was very well aware of political pitches being\r\nundertaken in Argentina, although I do not believe any work was ever\r\nactually done.\r\n\r\nQ1490 Julie Elliott: Who were the pitches to?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: To the current President.\r\n\r\nQ1491 Brendan O'Hara: You were director of programme development at\r\nCambridge Analytica between 2014 and 2018. Where were you\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\npredominantly based?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: For the first six or seven months I was based out of our\r\nLondon headquarters, which at the time was in Yarmouth Place in Mayfair.\r\nThen I moved to our office in Alexandria, Virginia for about nine months,\r\nand then to our office in New York for nine months. Since last August I\r\nhave been based in Mexico City until this past January, when I left the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nQ1492 Brendan O'Hara: On 27 February in front of this Committee Alexander\r\nNix said: \"I have been with the company for about 14 years and I have\r\nnever worked on a campaign in the UK\". Is that your understanding?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't believe that before our involvement with the\r\nLeave.EU campaign that Cambridge Analytica or the SCL Group ever\r\nundertook any political work in the United Kingdom. But in September\r\n2015, I believe, we began conversational engagements at first with\r\nLeave.EU and the UK Independence party—\r\n\r\nQ1493 Brendan O'Hara: Excuse me for interrupting. So, as the director of\r\nCambridge Analytica or SCL, you were unaware of that. Looking at the\r\nwebsite, it says: \"SCL Elections has worked on three UK election\r\ncampaigns over the past 15 years. During the first of these elections, SCL\r\nwas contracted to undertake advanced behavioural polling and Target\r\nAudience Analysis, and was subsequently credited as being the only\r\nagency to correctly predict the outcome of that General Election. For the\r\ntwo subsequent elections, SCL Elections provided campaign consultancy\r\nand strategic guidance for specific candidates.\" Are you utterly unaware\r\nof that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That was brought to my attention and I do not believe\r\nany of that is true. It was likely put on there as sales material to back up\r\nthe fact that we were worthy of being hired for the Leave.EU campaign.\r\n\r\nQ1494 Brendan O'Hara: So you, in your position as a director of a company,\r\nare saying that what was on the company's website is complete lies?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It could be. Just to differentiate between my directorship\r\nand an actual director of the company, I was a glorified sales person. I\r\nnever held an actual company directorship. Nor was I privy to any\r\nmanagement meetings or any higher-level executive authority.\r\n\r\nQ1495 Brendan O'Hara: It appears to me that these are quite specific boasts.\r\nFor this to be a complete fabrication—to be, as you say, a complete\r\ntissue of lies—I don't want to put words in your mouth, but are you\r\ntelling me that this is a complete tissue of lies?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I have never pitched that to absolutely anybody. It was\r\nnot on our website when I was engaged with Leave.EU. To Arron Banks,\r\nAndy Wigmore, Liz Bilney, Matthew Richardson—to everybody I was\r\npitching—I said that we had never undertaken work in the United\r\nKingdom, which I believed to be true. I have seen that before, and I\r\nbelieve it is a cached version of an old website that was never live, or was\r\nnever live when I was pitching on behalf of the company.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ1496 Brendan O'Hara: How would you describe a company that then\r\npromotes itself as having worked in three UK elections, having advanced\r\nbehavioural polling analysis, and worked for two subsequent elections,\r\neven down to the level of providing guidance for specific candidates?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't believe that was ever actually claimed. If it was\r\nput up on a website, I have never seen that live—but I have been shown\r\nthat piece of paper before.\r\n\r\nQ1497 Brendan O'Hara: So you believe Alexander Nix when he says, \"I have\r\nbeen with the company for about 14 years and I have never worked on a\r\ncampaign in the UK\", despite the company itself claiming to have worked\r\nextensively in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I am not sure that a cached version of an old website is\r\nan actual claim, but I do know that we have been in pitches and\r\nnegotiations with UK parties in the past, such as the SNP.\r\n\r\nQ1498 Brendan O'Hara: Well, I will leave you to follow that particular stag into\r\nthe forest, then. Please, feel free.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was not a part of those pitches or negotiations. I was\r\nbased in Washington DC at the time.\r\n\r\nQ1499 Brendan O'Hara: You've told me categorically that that's not true. You\r\nthen tell me that you have pitched work for the SNP but then tell me that\r\nyou know nothing about it.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe that there were meetings that took place in\r\nLondon, where individuals came down from Edinburgh to visit us at our\r\nMayfair headquarters. Then further meetings were undertaken in\r\nEdinburgh, near the Parliament.\r\n\r\nQ1500 Brendan O'Hara: And do you know the individuals concerned? Do you\r\nknow what the pitch was?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I could probably look through old emails and find some\r\nnames for you and submit that after this inquiry.\r\n\r\nQ1501 Brendan O'Hara: There was no work done at any UK elections for any\r\npolitical party, but you suddenly have a memory of meetings that you\r\nwere at and meetings with the SNP—is that right?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Pitches are very different from work undertaken. I would\r\nlike to correct that by saying that I do believe work was undertaken for a\r\nparty, and that was the UK Independence party—a small piece of work\r\nthat was meant to support the Leave.EU campaign during the Brexit\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nChair: We will come to that shortly.\r\n\r\nQ1502 Brendan O'Hara: Wrapping up, Christopher Wylie said he knew that\r\nCambridge Analytica had pitched for work in the 2014 Scottish\r\nindependence referendum, but he does not know what came of it. Do\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't believe that any work was actually undertaken.\r\n\r\nQ1503 Brendan O'Hara: Do you know what was pitched for and from whom?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It would have been for research modelling and targeted\r\ncommunications within Scotland and for individuals who had the right to\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nQ1504 Brendan O'Hara: Obviously they would have the right to vote, but I am\r\nasking, do you know which organisations you pitched for work from?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't know, but I could try to find that out for you,\r\nbecause I do have a significant amount of emails and documentation from\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nBrendan O'Hara: I'll leave it there and maybe return later.\r\n\r\nQ1505 Chair: You have mentioned a wide range of projects and pitches. Who\r\ntypically is involved in introducing Cambridge Analytica to meet new\r\nclients?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Either it would be somebody internally within the\r\ncompany—we had a lot of people who worked in business development or\r\nproject management who were specifically hired because of their global\r\nnetwork of individuals. We also had, I would say, a kind of roster of\r\nconsultants to the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica who were based\r\nglobally. Some of them would represent us in a part-time capacity and be\r\nthe local SCL Group office, and some of those individuals would only work\r\nfor commissions of contracts that they introduced and had no time\r\ncommitment to the company. So, introductions would usually come from\r\nindividuals that had contractual agreement with SCL Group and Cambridge\r\nAnalytica.\r\n\r\nQ1506 Chair: I just want to try and personalise it a little bit more. You have\r\nmentioned UKIP and Leave.EU. Who introduced, say, Arron Banks to\r\nCambridge Analytica?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe that introduction came from Steve Bannon,\r\nwho sat on our board at the time.\r\n\r\nQ1507 Chair: Among some of the other countries you have mentioned, you\r\nmentioned France. Which political organisation were you pitching to in\r\nFrance?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Originally it was to Sarkozy's campaign. That was before\r\nI started at the company, and I remember that Alexander used to tell the\r\nstory of how he pitched him and they said that they were going to win—\r\nand then lost—the election, so we returned again to pitch to the newly\r\nbranded Les Republicans.\r\n\r\nQ1508 Chair: And in Lithuania, which political party were you working for?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That was for a mayoral campaign in Vilnius. I can't\r\nremember the pronunciation or the exact name of the party itself.\r\n\r\nQ1509 Chair: And in Mexico?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: In Mexico, it was for the party that is currently in\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nQ1510 Paul Farrelly: Colleagues have got lots of questions in a few moments\r\nabout Leave.EU and the work—unpaid—that was done. But for me, as\r\nwell as your statement about Emerdata, it is a moving story, where\r\nrevelations are coming from different sources at all times. When we\r\ninterviewed Alexander Nix, the line of questioning, because of the\r\nknowledge at the time, was focused on Leave.EU, and then we had\r\nsubsequent revelations about AggregateIQ and its involvement and\r\nconnections with SCL, Cambridge Analytica—the whole group. I just\r\nwanted to ask you a few questions about that, because my abiding\r\nimpression after interviewing Mr Nix is that he left all that bit out and that\r\nwe were rather blindsided. Have you watched that interview?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, I have.\r\n\r\nQ1511 Paul Farrelly: Do you think I am right to feel blindsided a little bit?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I think that you are right to feel that there was some\r\ninformation that was left out, whether intentionally or unintentionally.\r\n\r\nQ1512 Paul Farrelly: Clearly, there is a difference between what happened,\r\nwhat work was really done, and the bullshit of sales pitches that you have\r\ndescribed. You say in your evidence: \"I should emphasise that the\r\nKogan/GSR datasets and questionnaires were not the only Facebook-\r\nconnected questionnaires and datasets which Cambridge Analytica\r\nused...But I believe it is almost certain that the number of Facebook users\r\nwhose data was compromised through routes similar to that used by\r\nKogan is much greater than 87 million; and that both Cambridge\r\nAnalytica and other unconnected companies and campaigns were\r\ninvolved in these activities.\" Can you expand a little on that, please?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course. When I first joined the company, our creative\r\nand psychology teams and data science teams worked together to design\r\nsome of these questionnaires. So I am aware now of what the\r\nquestionnaire was that Professor Kogan used, although I didn't know\r\nabout it when I joined the company.\r\n\r\nI would see questionnaires. For example, there was one called the \"sex\r\ncompass\", to find out what your personal preferences were privately, and\r\nthen there was another one on your \"music personality\". In my pitches, I\r\nused to give examples, even to clients, that if you go on Facebook and see\r\nthese viral personality quizzes, not all of them would have been designed\r\nby Cambridge Analytica, SCL Group or our affiliates, but that these\r\napplications were designed specifically to harvest data from individuals\r\nusing Facebook as the tool.\r\n\r\nI know at least of those two examples—the music version and the \"sex\r\ncompass\"—which were both quizzes that were separate from Aleksandr\r\nKogan's quiz. Therefore, it can be inferred or implied that there were many\r\nadditional individuals, as opposed to just the ones through Aleksandr\r\nKogan's test, whose data may have been compromised.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ1513 Paul Farrelly: It seems blindingly obvious, but we need to search for the\r\nevidence. If you have gathered this tremendous data set because you\r\nhave had access not only to respondees but to their friends and their\r\nlikes through Facebook, and you have developed this for the US, then if\r\nthis trick works, you would want to replicate it for other markets that you\r\nwere pitching for work in, would you not?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That was the idea, although in Europe it is quite difficult\r\ndue to the data protection laws.\r\n\r\nQ1514 Paul Farrelly: If you observe them?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Correct.\r\n\r\nQ1515 Paul Farrelly: Could you describe what knowledge you have about\r\nAggregateIQ and how it operated under the SCL umbrella?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course. It was my understanding when I joined the\r\ncompany that AggregateIQ was our exclusive digital and data engineering\r\npartner. They would build our software, such as a platform that we\r\ndesigned for Senator Ted Cruz's campaign. That was meant to collect data\r\nfor canvassing individuals who would go door to door collecting and\r\nhygiening data of individuals in those households. We also had no internal\r\ndigital capacity at the time, so we did not actually undertake any of our\r\ndigital campaigns. That was done exclusively through AggregateIQ.\r\n\r\nThrough the rollercoaster of Senator Cruz's campaign and engagements\r\nwith the consultants who were working on it, I believed that our\r\nrelationship with AggregateIQ became strained. They did not turn in work\r\nto us on time. Our clients were not always happy with their performance\r\nand we therefore stopped working with them. Subsequently, we have\r\nheard in the press and from other individuals that some of our board\r\nmembers might have had ownership of AggregateIQ, which I was not\r\naware of at all.\r\n\r\nQ1516 Paul Farrelly: When did you think or consider that the group had\r\nstopped working with AggregateIQ?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Probably late 2015 was when issues became quite\r\nstrained, when the campaign ramped up and we were near the end of the\r\nRepublican primaries.\r\n\r\nQ1517 Paul Farrelly: We have had a series of documents and testimonies from\r\nMr Wylie that allege that AggregateIQ was part of the SCL-CA umbrella,\r\ndid extensive work for Vote Leave and was paid a large sum of money for\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I have seen that and his testimony could be exactly\r\ncorrect. I had no knowledge of that type of relationship with AIQ and I\r\nactually have never met Chris Wylie. He was no longer with the company\r\nwhen I joined and I believed that he was a consultant, sometimes referred\r\nto as SCL Canada, that was based in Canada, working full time for\r\nAggregateIQ.\r\n\r\nQ1518 Paul Farrelly: Before and during the referendum campaign here, what\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nwas your state of awareness of any work that was being done by the\r\ngroup, including AggregatelQ, for Vote Leave?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: My only interaction with Vote Leave was that I was\r\nsupposed to have a meeting with Matthew Elliott two days after my first\r\nmeeting with Arron Banks. That meeting was cancelled after he found out\r\nthat we had a meeting with executives from Leave.EU, so I never met\r\nanybody from Vote Leave and I did not know that AIQ, whom I did not\r\nthink we were working with at the time anyway—nor did I think we had\r\njoint investors or owners of our companies—was pitching for that work or\r\nundertaking any of that work.\r\n\r\nQ1519 Paul Farrelly: So while you were there—and you were there until early\r\nthis year—you were not aware of any talk, chatter or boasts within the\r\ncompany at the time SCL Cambridge Analytica were doing extensive work\r\nwith AggregateIQ within their umbrella for Vote Leave?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I wish that I was. It sounds like we probably were\r\nworking very closely, but I was not involved in US politics at that point.\r\n\r\nQ1520 Paul Farrelly: UK?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Well—\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: It was a UK referendum. The United States was not leaving\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course, but Cambridge Analytica and the joint\r\nownership of Aggregate IQ was based out of our US companies and\r\naffiliates.\r\n\r\nChair: One of your associates is handing you a piece of paper. We are\r\nhappy to give you a moment to look at it before Mr Farrelly resumes his\r\nquestions, if that would be helpful.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes. Of course, I cannot speak for SCL Canada and their\r\nrelationship with Aggregate IQ, or about documents I am not privy to.\r\n\r\nQ1521 Paul Farrelly: So what were you doing in the group at the time of the\r\nreferendum in the UK? You were pitching elsewhere, were you?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes. I was between Washington, DC and London. I was\r\nundertaking a series of pitches for Leave.EU, the UK Independence party,\r\nand Eldon and GoSkippy Insurance.\r\n\r\nQ1522 Paul Farrelly: But you were left out of any work with Vote Leave. That\r\nseems odd.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Well, Vote Leave was technically the competition to\r\nLeave.EU. So upon engaging with Leave.EU I was not supposed to be\r\nmeeting with Vote Leave, because we were in competition with them for\r\nthe designation from the Electoral Commission.\r\n\r\nQ1523 Paul Farrelly: So it seems there was a Chinese wall operating within the\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It sounds like there was.\r\n\r\nQ1524 Paul Farrelly: But you didn't know about it?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, sir.\r\n\r\nQ1525 Chair: I just want to pick up one thing that you mentioned there, which\r\nwas the other personality surveys that Cambridge Analytica ran on\r\nFacebook. We touched on that with Alexander Nix last time around, and\r\nhe said that those surveys where there was a Facebook login at the end\r\nto complete the survey did not mean that your personal data was then\r\nbeing accessed by Cambridge Analytica. But you are saying that that was\r\nnot the case—that actually the purpose of the survey was to gather this\r\ninformation and that by completing it with your Facebook login,\r\nCambridge Analytica will also get access to your data on Facebook.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe that was the point of the quizzes in the first\r\nplace, yes.\r\n\r\nChair: That does sound like the point of it, but that is totally different\r\nfrom what Alexander Nix said to us.\r\n\r\nQ1526 Ian C. Lucas: Did you know at the time that you were pitching to\r\nLeave.EU that Cambridge Analytica was also pitching to Vote Leave?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I knew that I had a meeting that was meant to take\r\nplace after Leave.EU, so that I could also explore work with Vote Leave,\r\nbut, as I said, that meeting was cancelled and I didn't know that there\r\nwere any further engagements with Vote Leave until Mr Arron Banks made\r\nit clear that he was not interested in paying us for any of the work that we\r\nhad either already undertaken or proposed to undertake. So I do believe\r\nthat some of my executives re-engaged in talks with Vote Leave, but at\r\nthe time I was no longer involved in that.\r\n\r\nQ1527 Ian C. Lucas: Did you know that Cambridge Analytica had an agreement\r\nwith AIQ to transfer data?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: We would have had that, because that would have been\r\nessential to our work on Senator Ted Cruz's presidential campaign. But I\r\nwas under the impression that AIQ did not fulfil its contractual obligations\r\nto our client and therefore we were no longer working with them. I\r\nremember many angry phone calls back and forth between AIQ and our\r\ninternal staff, that tensions were very tight, and that we decided instead\r\nto hire our own data engineers and our own internal digital team, and\r\nbuild out internal capacity, so that we no longer had to rely on them.\r\n\r\nQ1528 Ian C. Lucas: Can you confirm that Cambridge Analytica transferred\r\ndata to AIQ?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: What I can say is that the essential relationship between\r\nAIQ and Cambridge Analytica—or the SCL Group—was that AIQ had built\r\nplatforms that we used to collect data, so we would have had to transfer\r\ndata between ourselves for us to access that; and that they also ran our\r\ndigital campaigns for a while, not just for Senator Ted Cruz, but for other\r\nclients—political, commercial and social. So we would have had to transfer\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\ndata back to them for them to use those lists for digital targeting. I believe\r\nthat by the essential nature of that relationship, that would have been a\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\nQ1529 Ian C. Lucas: Of course, once data is transferred to AIQ, they have the\r\ndata from Cambridge Analytica. So they could use Cambridge Analytica\r\ndata to pursue their relationship with Vote Leave.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: They could have done, but likely in contravention to the\r\ncontracts that we originally signed with them—although I am not privy to\r\nthose contracts, so I can't be sure.\r\n\r\nQ1530 Chair: On a point of clarification, you mentioned Chris Wylie worked for\r\nSCL Canada.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That was the name used for—I don't know him as an\r\nindividual or the AIQ office. That was considered SCL Canada. Our\r\ncompany tended to have a business model where we would partner with\r\nanother company, and that company would represent us as SCL Germany\r\nor SCL USA. That was the model.\r\n\r\nQ1531 Chair: So, as far as you are concerned, SCL Canada and AIQ are the\r\nsame thing.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe so, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1532 Chair: Do you believe Chris Wylie was working for AIQ if he was also\r\nworking for SCL Canada?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, I believe that SCL Canada was just a glorified title,\r\nbut he was full time engaged with AIQ.\r\n\r\nQ1533 Simon Hart: Sticking with the referendum theme for a moment and\r\ndealing more specifically with Leave.EU, once the pitch was successful,\r\nwhat was the actual level of work involved between Cambridge Analytica\r\nand Leave.EU? What was the scope of the work?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: When I first began engagement with Leave.EU we had\r\nparallel discussions going on on what became—\r\n\r\nQ1534 Simon Hart: You pitched for the work yourself?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, myself and our CFO and COO, Julian Wheatland,\r\nwho is the current acting CEO, and a senior data scientist and usually a\r\npsychologist would be in the room as well, or one of our researchers. We\r\nwere undertaking parallel pitches for Leave.EU, the UK Independence\r\nparty and Eldon and GoSkippy Insurance. Those proposals at first were all\r\npreliminary. The one for Leave.EU and the UK Independence party\r\nincluded taking receipt of data and matching that data with researcher\r\nsurvey data and then modelling it so that we could find the different\r\npersonality types of individuals that would be most likely to engage with\r\nthe messaging for Leave.EU. That was specifically for individuals that\r\nwould be interested in voting to leave in the referendum, and for the UK\r\nIndependence party it was obviously similar, as that is the nature of the\r\nparty itself.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nWhen we first started talking to Leave.EU they did not have much data to\r\nspeak of because it was very much in the beginning of the campaign. So,\r\nin parallel, we were in talks with the UK Independence party where we\r\nbelieved that their membership data would be quite indicative of\r\nindividuals that were interested in the UK leaving the European Union. It\r\nwas decided that, while Leave.EU did not possess much data, we could\r\nbegin with an engagement for the UK Independence party, which we did.\r\nWe took receipt of their membership data and survey data. There was a\r\nsurvey among their members of different reasons why people might be\r\ninterested in the UK leaving the European Union and what the benefits or\r\nconsequences might be. That survey data was matched to the\r\nmembership data and used to make a model. Out of that analysis we\r\nfound five different personality types.\r\n\r\nQ1535 Simon Hart: How much data are we talking about? How many people? I\r\ndon't know what the membership of UKIP was at the time.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I would like to follow up with documentation on that. I\r\nnever took receipt of the data, so I don't know what the final count was,\r\nbut I probably have an email somewhere that states the number. I can\r\nrevert with that.\r\n\r\nThe analysis was drawn up into briefing material. Those briefs were used\r\nin order to talk to the executives of the Leave.EU campaign and other\r\nconsultants about the insights that we had from the UK Independence\r\nparty data, and that was used to give insights for their social media\r\nmessaging, their campaign messaging, events, canvassing and so forth.\r\nWhile we were undertaking this work we were also being consulted by\r\nPhilip Coppel, QC on how this data could be used and modelled.\r\n\r\nQ1536 Simon Hart: Who was he working for? Who was paying him?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: He was contracted by Cambridge Analytica through\r\nMatthew Richardson, a barrister who I believe was secretary of the UK\r\nIndependence party at the time. I believe I have turned those documents\r\nin to the Committee as well, where we were given advice on what we\r\ncould and could not do.\r\n\r\nThat was preliminary while we were planning on working with national\r\ndata sets and undertaking a much larger survey than the one that we\r\nwere provided with by the party itself. This piece of work was, in the\r\nproposal and in the contract and invoice that we submitted to them, a\r\nchargeable piece of work—not very significant in terms of our other pricing\r\nstructures, but £41,500, which is something that should have been paid. I\r\nunderstand that in the press two days ago it came to light that Arron\r\nBanks made a donation to the UK Independence party a week before the\r\nreferendum vote that was meant to cover that piece of work, but the UK\r\nIndependence party decided not pass on those funds to Cambridge\r\nAnalytica and pay the invoice that we had submitted.\r\n\r\nQ1537 Simon Hart: On the question of money, what was the total value—this\r\nmay be somewhere in the written evidence; forgive me if it is—of the\r\ncontract between Cambridge Analytica and Leave.EU?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: We never had a contract with Leave.EU. The contract\r\nwas with the UK Independence party for the analysis of this data, but it\r\nwas meant to benefit Leave.EU.\r\n\r\nQ1538 Simon Hart: Okay, so who paid who how much money, and when did\r\nthey pay it?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: We submitted a contract for £41,500, and that was\r\nnever paid to us.\r\n\r\nQ1539 Simon Hart: That was for the whole thing—for the company's entire\r\ninvolvement in this process?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That was meant to be phase 1. I had two choices of next\r\nphases for engagements, which were to be either almost £500,000—it was\r\n£496,500—or, if we were to license them further data, undertake further\r\ndatabase engineering and give them access to our software development\r\nplatform Connect, which was for data management and canvassing\r\npurposes, it would have been £808,100.\r\n\r\nQ1540 Simon Hart: It may be a slightly unfair question, but how much of that,\r\nif you can remember, came in during the reporting period—the period\r\nthey would have been legally required to declare that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: None of what was proposed in this document was\r\nactually undertaken. It was only phase 1 of my first preliminary proposal\r\nthat was undertaken, and that was a total of £41,500.\r\n\r\nQ1541 Simon Hart: I suppose I am trying to put words in your mouth slightly.\r\nAs far as you were aware, all the necessary declarations were made by—I\r\nthought it was going to be just Leave.EU, but you are suggesting that the\r\nrelationship could have been more directly with UKIP. As far as you are\r\nconcerned, the legal requirements in terms of reporting were fulfilled.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, sir. I do not believe that our work was reported by\r\nanyone—not by Leave.EU, not by UKIP, and not by Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nQ1542 Ian C. Lucas: You mentioned that Steve Bannon facilitated the\r\nintroduction. Was that to Leave.EU or to UKIP?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't recall. I was not copied into those\r\ncommunications, but I was pretty sure that he was involved in the setting\r\nup of the first meetings. That could also have been true of our meeting\r\nwith Vote Leave that was then cancelled. I am not sure of the exact\r\nrelationships there.\r\n\r\nQ1543 Ian C. Lucas: So when you were pitching, did you think that you were\r\npitching to UKIP or Leave.EU?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I knew that I was pitching to Leave.EU, although\r\nMatthew Richardson, the party secretary, was part of those meetings\r\nalmost every time. I knew that UKIP was a public supporter of the\r\nLeave.EU campaign, and that much of the work that we were being asked\r\nto design in our proposals was going to be either parallel or joint\r\nworkstreams.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ1544 Ian C. Lucas: I am concerned about the transfer of data between UKIP\r\nand Leave.EU. Did you say that Mr Richardson was the secretary of UKIP?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe that he was. I don't know if he still is.\r\n\r\nQ1545 Ian C. Lucas: He appears to have been concerned about it as well,\r\nbecause he commissioned a legal opinion on the issue on 17 November\r\n2015. Did he commission it?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: He commissioned it alongside ourselves, as Cambridge\r\nAnalytica, because we wanted to understand the implications of the usage\r\nof the data that UKIP was transferring to us—what we could do with it, not\r\nonly for that first project but for the remainder of the Brexit campaign\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\nQ1546 Ian C. Lucas: That's very odd, if Mr Richardson commissioned the\r\nopinion, because his name is at the end of it, giving the opinion. So he\r\nhas commissioned an opinion from himself, and then given the opinion\r\nthat he perhaps wanted to hear, which was presented to Cambridge\r\nAnalytica. Is that right?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe it was technically paid for and commissioned by\r\nCambridge Analytica to Philip Coppel, QC. Matthew Richardson was a part\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nQ1547 Ian C. Lucas: Just for clarification, Matthew Richardson and Philip\r\nCoppel, QC have signed this opinion.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1548 Ian C. Lucas: Now, I am a lawyer, but I am not an expensive lawyer—\r\nI'm not a QC. My understanding is that, for example, the Labour party\r\nwouldn't be permitted to transfer data to Britain Stronger in Europe,\r\nbecause they are different organisations. Is that your understanding, too?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes. I would say that it's probably not normal\r\nprofessional practice to be one of the people giving a legal opinion to your\r\nown organisation.\r\n\r\nQ1549 Ian C. Lucas: Let's just talk about transferring data. Do you think it is\r\nlawful—you work in this field—to transfer data from a political party to a\r\nseparate campaign in connection with leaving the EU?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Not without the specific opt-in of the individuals whose\r\ndata is concerned.\r\n\r\nQ1550 Ian C. Lucas: Do you know what this opinion was used for?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: This opinion was used for the phase 1 small piece of\r\nwork that we undertook.\r\n\r\nQ1551 Ian C. Lucas: So it wasn't presented, for example, to Arron Banks.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I'm not sure. I do know that Matthew Richardson sent it\r\nto me and Julian Wheatland for us to understand, or at least to give it to\r\nour data scientists and our legal team to understand what could be\r\nundertaken with that data. There are quite a few more implications to that\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nopinion. During our analysis of the UKIP data set, we were asked by Arron\r\nBanks to consider combining the three work streams that we were talking\r\nto him and his colleagues about. Those work streams were for Leave.EU,\r\nthe UK Independence party and Eldon or GoSkippy insurance. We made a\r\nfourth proposal—\r\n\r\nQ1552 Ian C. Lucas: That's a private company.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, it is.\r\n\r\nQ1553 Ian C. Lucas: Which is owned by Mr Banks, just for clarity.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe so, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1554 Ian C. Lucas: So it appears that he was transferring data between a\r\nprivate company, a political party and a campaign to leave the EU.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I have two points on that. One is that he asked us to\r\ndesign a strategy, where we could work with Leave.UK, UKIP and Eldon\r\ninsurance data together. You will see that the fourth proposal that I turned\r\nin to Arron Banks shows a diagram: complementary work streams for\r\nUKIP, Leave.EU and Eldon insurance. We were asked whether savings\r\ncould be achieved by running these three programmes together, instead of\r\nseparately. I believe that that legal opinion is one of many that would\r\nhave had to be undertaken if we were going to be contracted to do this\r\npiece of work. We were never contracted to do this piece of work,\r\nalthough from other evidence that has been given by individuals such as\r\nDr Emma Briant, and by Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore themselves to\r\nthe press and others, upon knowledge of recording, I believe that this\r\nwork was carried out, just not by Cambridge Analytica.\r\n\r\nIt is of note that within the legal opinion that I provided to you, in\r\nparagraph 64, Mr Philip Coppel specifically says that the data under no\r\ncircumstances should be transferred abroad. That is specifically because\r\nCambridge Analytica is a foreign company. That would need to be written\r\nout in the contract and all this data would have to be analysed within the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this proposal and work that I believe was undertaken with or\r\nwithout us, there are a few specific concerns of legality. I believe those\r\nconcerns are also concerns of the Committee. The first is in relation to\r\nbreaches of electoral law for chargeable work, some of which I did, which\r\nwas never paid for and was unreported to the Electoral Commission.\r\n\r\nSecondly, I have evidence from my own eyes of possible breaches of the\r\nData Protection Act concerning the commercial and personal data of\r\nindividuals in the Eldon Insurance database, and possibly the UKIP\r\ndatabase, being used for the benefit of the Leave.EU campaign. I am just\r\ngoing to expand on that slightly. I visited the Eldon Insurance and\r\nLeave.EU headquarters, which was the same building, with the same staff.\r\nWhen a senior data scientist and myself spent time with their phone bank,\r\nI was told by the people using the phone bank that the individuals they\r\nwere calling were out of the insurance database.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nThirdly, there is the question of whether the personal data of British\r\ncitizens was sent abroad, specifically to Mississippi for processing by Arron\r\nBanks' firm, Big Data Dolphins, contrary to the Data Protection Act and to\r\nthe advice of Mr Philip Coppel, QC.\r\n\r\nQ1555 Ian C. Lucas: We also know that Cambridge Analytica shared data with\r\nAIQ. There was a contract, but AIQ is a Canadian company, so\r\npresumably that was in contradiction to this provision as well.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I can infer that from the evidence that has been\r\nsubmitted by others, but because I do not have any knowledge of that\r\nmyself, I couldn't expand that far.\r\n\r\nQ1556 Ian C. Lucas: Do you know whether any other private businesses shared\r\ndata with Cambridge Analytica through UKIP?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, although we were exploring matching data from\r\nExperian, which is a big data vendor that we work with in the United\r\nStates. We were exploring licensing that in the United Kingdom for\r\nmatching to the UKIP database and to any database of individuals that\r\nwould have been collected by Leave.EU.\r\n\r\nQ1557 Ian C. Lucas: Do you know whether Wetherspoons ever shared any\r\ninformation with UKIP?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, I don't know. If there is evidence of that, it would be\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nQ1558 Ian C. Lucas: Yes, it would be very interesting. You talked about the SCL\r\nGroup, including Cambridge Analytica, very much as one organisation.\r\nThe picture that I have is of data being shared freely between all of the\r\ncompanies within that group. Is that accurate?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I am not sure which entity actually owned the database,\r\nbut most of the staff within Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group had\r\ntwo business cards and two emails. We worked for SCL Group and\r\nCambridge Analytica in parallel.\r\n\r\nQ1559 Ian C. Lucas: When I spoke to Mr Nix, he said that SCL could transfer\r\ndata to Cambridge Analytica but, for security reasons, Cambridge\r\nAnalytica could not transfer data to SCL, because SCL had security\r\nclearance. Does that ring any bells?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Ah, yes. It is a very complicated structure.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Some might say deliberately so.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Possibly. Originally, the SCL Group was the parent\r\ncompany for all these other divisions, including Cambridge Analytica. Now,\r\nonce Cambridge Analytica became a very popular global brand, Cambridge\r\nAnalytica then subsumed most of those companies and divisions and the\r\nSCL Group became just our defence company, SCL Group or SCL.gov,\r\nbased in Arlington.\r\n\r\nQ1560 Ian C. Lucas: But Cambridge Analytica had access to the SCL database?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe once the company was rebranded that there\r\nshould have been, at least, no access between those two companies\r\nexcept for the contractual obligations that you are discussing, although I\r\ndo not believe up until that point that there was a difference between the\r\nSCL Group and the Cambridge Analytica database. That would be slightly\r\nconcerning when we are talking about the difference between commercial\r\nand political and defence work.\r\n\r\nI have had those concerns in the past because when I joined the\r\ncompany—I didn't remember this, but upon reflection—I found documents\r\nfrom Nigel Oakes, the co-founder of the SCL Group, who was in charge of\r\nour defence division, stating that the target audience analysis\r\nmethodology, TAA, used to be export controlled by the British\r\nGovernment. That would mean that the methodology was considered a\r\nweapon—weapons grade communications tactics—which means that we\r\nhad to tell the British Government if that was going to be deployed in\r\nanother country outside the United Kingdom. I understand that\r\ndesignation was removed in 2015.\r\n\r\nQ1561 Ian C. Lucas: Can I ask a question about the invoice issued by\r\nCambridge Analytica to UKIP? Do you know why that was issued to UKIP\r\nas opposed to Leave.EU?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, Leave.EU did not have any data yet at the\r\nbeginning, because it was just a campaign, so we went to UKIP—they\r\nwere participating in our meetings jointly with Leave.EU executives—in\r\norder to find some data to begin working on. That was the UKIP\r\nmembership data and the survey data provided to us for the phase 1 piece\r\nof work.\r\n\r\nQ1562 Ian C. Lucas: But the intention was—the work that you were doing was\r\nrelating to a pitch to work for Leave.EU?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nQ1563 Chair: Just to clarify, what you said about the target audience analysis\r\nwork—that was part of the proposal put together for Leave.EU. That is\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1564 Chair: So what you are saying is that the proposal was for Leave.EU to\r\nuse what you call \"weapons grade communications techniques\" against\r\nthe UK population?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe that in 2015 target audience analysis no longer\r\nhad an export designation. I don't know at what point that was dropped\r\noff, but I believe that it still existed in 2014 when I joined the company.\r\n\r\nQ1565 Chair: What do you mean by \"export designation\"?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't actually know the complexities of this, but I\r\nbelieve that every year or every few years something that is export\r\ncontrolled has to be renewed, and that was not renewed. I don't know\r\nwhat you need to qualify for that or what the implications of that are.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ1566 Chair: Basically, these were techniques where previously you would have\r\nneeded to inform the authorities that you intend to use these in the UK—\r\nwould that be correct?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That is what I was told by Nigel Oakes, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1567 Chair: And when that designation was removed, it could be done without\r\ninforming the authorities, but nevertheless, it is still the same product. A\r\nproduct that was considered so dangerous that its use was restricted:\r\nnevertheless the intention was that that strategy would be used in the\r\nreferendum campaign?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: The interesting thing is that the target audience analysis\r\nuses a lot less data than psychographic micro-targeting, which is what we\r\nuse in the United States.\r\n\r\nQ1568 Jo Stevens: Can I ask a few questions about the Eldon Insurance and\r\nthe Leave.EU stuff? But first, this invoice for the work that you did on\r\nphase 1 which you have described, can you remember the dates between\r\nwhich you did the work—when it started roughly and when it finished\r\nroughly?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, I believe we took receipt of the data in late\r\nOctober, although I wasn't present in the office; I was in DC when a\r\nmember of the UK Independence Party showed up to SCL Group's HQ in\r\nMayfair with a big computer stack.\r\n\r\nThat was their form of transferring data—they actually brought an old\r\ndesktop into the office physically. We took the membership data and the\r\nsurvey data off that computer and began analysing it. Usually that type of\r\nmatching, modelling and analysis takes us two to three weeks. I don't\r\nknow how many days our data scientists actually spent on that, but we\r\nestimated that the work was worth £41,500 based on the time spent—\r\n\r\nQ1569 Jo Stevens: Sorry to interrupt you. Is that on market rates or mates'\r\nrates?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, that was generally what we were charging at the\r\ntime. That was in preparation for the public press conference that we did\r\non 18 November. There would have been a couple of weeks of work\r\nleading up to that. I spent 18 November, the day before and the day after\r\nin Millbank Tower, the Leave.EU London offices, briefing everybody who\r\nwas working at those offices on my findings, and working with the\r\ncommunications and social media teams on how you could use that insight\r\nto craft different communications campaigns.\r\n\r\nQ1570 Jo Stevens: When did the work that you were doing on that phase stop?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It would have been within a couple of days after that.\r\nThe rest of it was putting together this joint proposal, which took quite a\r\nfew weeks to do, to understand the complexities of how the data could\r\npossibly be combined, although we would probably have had to have a few\r\nmore legal opinions drawn up to understand that we could do this, or have\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nundertaken opt-in campaigns with the individuals whose data were\r\ncontained on those databases.\r\n\r\nThe last time I actually engaged with any individuals in Leave.EU myself\r\nwas at the end of November, although in January this proposal was\r\npresented by Julian Wheatland and Alexander Nix to, I believe, Arron\r\nBanks, Liz Bilney, Andy Wigmore and Matthew Richardson.\r\n\r\nQ1571 Jo Stevens: Thank you. I think you said earlier regarding this proposal\r\nthat although you did not undertake this work for Arron Banks, it has\r\nsubsequently been done. Do you know who has done that work?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Both Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore have told multiple\r\nindividuals that they took my proposal and copied it, and that they created\r\ntheir own Cambridge Analytica which they called Big Data Dolphins, in\r\npartnership with the data science department at Ole Miss University—the\r\nUniversity of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nQ1572 Jo Stevens: So presumably—stop me if I am wrong—implementing this\r\nproposal involves, based on what you have said, taking data from UK\r\ncustomers of Eldon Insurance, GoSkippy Insurance, UKIP members and\r\nVote Leave data.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Leave.EU data.\r\n\r\nQ1573 Jo Stevens: Sorry—Leave.EU data. And that goes over into the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1574 Jo Stevens: Do you know whether or not Cambridge Analytica have a\r\ncontinuing relationship, other than what you have already described—I\r\nam particularly interested in Julian Wheatland's involvement in this—with\r\nArron Banks?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't believe so. He never paid us for any of our work,\r\nnever accepted any of our subsequent proposals, and has bragged about\r\ncopying our company and recreating it for himself, so I do not believe that\r\nthere would be a relationship left to have.\r\n\r\nQ1575 Jo Stevens: Okay, thank you. I know in your written evidence you\r\nmention the fact that there was a discussion, or something was talked\r\nabout with Arron Banks, about the use of the Eldon and GoSkippy data.\r\nTo quote from your written evidence: \"Arron Banks said, Tt's my data'\",\r\nso he is using customer data from GoSkippy and Eldon Insurance for\r\nother purposes.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That is what I saw with my own eyes when I spent a day\r\nat the Bristol headquarters. I was brought there under the understanding\r\nthat I was going to Leave.EU's headquarters. It became very quickly\r\nobvious that this was actually an Eldon Insurance headquarters, which is\r\nalso the parent company of GoSkippy—maybe that is one of their brands.\r\n\r\nAll the staff there were employed by an insurance company and almost\r\nnone knew anything about political campaigning. A lot of what I said to\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nthem and what I presented to them was novel. They had never heard of\r\nany of these tactics. They had never participated in politics before and\r\nopenly said, \"I work for an insurance company, so—help!\"\r\n\r\nQ1576 Jo Stevens: So why were you going to see the people in the call centre?\r\nWere they going to be working on the Leave.EU campaign?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: They were actively working on the Leave.EU campaign\r\nwhen I was there.\r\n\r\nQ1577 Jo Stevens: And how many people were working in the call centre?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: The call centre was about the size of this room—maybe\r\na little bit smaller—with at least, probably, 20 active callers. They all had a\r\ncomputer and a headset, making calls that I assume were normally sales\r\ncalls or calls for customer assistance or advice, and instead they were\r\ncalling people to undertake a survey.\r\n\r\nThey were talking to those people about their interest in leaving the\r\nEuropean Union, and issues around Brexit, and Leave or Remain. We were\r\nsitting with those individuals specifically because we said it was unlikely\r\nthat the survey that they were undertaking was up to scratch with what\r\nwe would need for modelling. So, we sat there to understand what data\r\nthey were using, what surveys they were undertaking and how we could\r\nimprove on that, so that that data could be used for nationwide modelling.\r\n\r\nI was under the impression, by what they told me, that every single\r\nindividual that they were pulling up to call was actually a lead or a current\r\ncustomer of Eldon Insurance or GoSkippy.\r\n\r\nQ1578 Jo Stevens: And do you know for how long they'd been making those\r\ncalls? I think you visited in November, didn't you?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe I visited in November, yes; I would have to\r\ndouble-check that. But it would have been end of October/early\r\nNovember. And they had probably already been doing that for a month or\r\ntwo, because we started having these conversations with them in\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nQ1579 Jo Stevens: Right. And this was a full-time call centre?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1580 Jo Stevens: With 20 people in it?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: At least.\r\n\r\nQ1581 Chair: I just want to clarify the dates. So, the date of the legal opinion,\r\nwhich you presented as written evidence, the date that was signed off\r\nwas the day before the press launch for Leave.EU. Are those two things\r\nconnected? Was this commissioned just to check that the methodology or\r\nthe way of working that would be at the press launch was in fact legal?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, before I presented it to members of Leave.EU.\r\nQ1582 Chair: So there was a concern, clearly, within the organisation that that\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nopinion needed to be sought before the official launch, because there was\r\nsome ambiguity?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: The idea was that directly after the press launch we\r\nwould begin phase 2 of the proposal and we needed to understand what\r\nthe legalities around beginning that second phase of work would be.\r\n\r\nQ1583 Chair: But as Mr Lucas mentioned earlier on, the existence of that\r\nopinion would seem to suggest that there clearly was a working\r\nrelationship, which was being tested here.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course. We knew, though, that with the data that was\r\ngiven to us by UKIP for phase 1, we were allowed to model internal data\r\nfor UKIP, but I wouldn't have been able to present that to Leave.EU\r\nwithout that legal opinion nor suggest that I could undertake phase 2 of\r\nthe proposal, or begin contractual negotiations over that.\r\n\r\nQ1584 Chair: There were other organisations, obviously, involved in\r\ncampaigning on the referendum question, aside from those that got the\r\nofficial designation. That includes organisations like Grassroots Out. Were\r\nthey involved? Was data from Grassroots Out accessible to the work you\r\nwere doing, with the intention to use that, too?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was no longer in conversation with any of these\r\nindividuals when they became Grassroots Out. That was way later, after\r\nArron Banks made it very clear that none of our contracts were going to\r\nbe signed or our bills paid.\r\n\r\nQ1585 Chair: From the email evidence you've supplied to us, and you refer to it\r\nin your statement as well, you clearly believe that Arron Banks had\r\napproved the budget that was presented?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, or at least Liz Bilney, who was the CEO of Leave.EU\r\nat the time and his right hand—she travelled with him everywhere and\r\nwas in charge of multiple of his businesses, or business engagements, all\r\nover the world. So, she had given us the green light, in writing and\r\nverbally, and therefore I asked Julian—at the time, our CFO—if we could\r\nhave the go-ahead to begin work. He was in charge of our finances and if\r\nhe said, you know, on a gentlemen's agreement, \"Go ahead, while we wait\r\nfor the legal opinion and the contract\", then that was my permission to go\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nQ1586 Chair: The preparatory work that was done was analysing the data\r\navailable at Eldon and through GoSkippy to see what information they\r\nhad and how that could be used. I imagine that that data in and of\r\nitself—it needs to be processed in some way to make it useful to a\r\npolitical campaign.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It would have to have been, yes. I was just looking at\r\nwhat was available. I had seen that a data scientist who was there with\r\nme was looking to see what was there, so that we understood how we\r\ncould process it.\r\n\r\nQ1587 Chair: Just for the record and the Committee, it might be helpful if you\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\ncould walk us through what the recommendation was. How do you\r\nprocess that data to make it useful to a political campaign? What do you\r\nneed to add to it to make it work?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: So, by nature of data science, the more that you know\r\nabout an individual, the more accurate an algorithm you can build to\r\npredict their behaviour, their opinions, their personality, or their emotions\r\non a certain issue. We would have taken the data that we had on their\r\ncommercial and political activities, and the most data that we could pin\r\nback to their personally identifiable information.\r\n\r\nIn the US we would use first name, last name, zip code or post code, and\r\na birthdate to ensure that we were talking about the right person. Then\r\nyou continue to append that data to get as deep a data profile on an\r\nindividual as possible. On top of that, once you have data profiles on as\r\nmany people across the country as possible, you would design a\r\nquantitative survey. I believe we said that we were going to do two\r\nsurveys of 40,000 individuals, and that is used as a training set. So when\r\nwe know what 40,000 people would answer on specific questions about\r\npolitical ideology and issues, then we can build a model that gives us\r\npredictions about what everybody else would say.\r\n\r\nQ1588 Chair: And then, presumably, would you then use tools like Facebook to\r\nhelp identify people from the training set, and then invite other people\r\nlike them, who Facebook can help you identify?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Exactly correct.\r\n\r\nQ1589 Jo Stevens: The Eldon and GoSkippy insurance data—did they give you\r\nall the customers' data? Do you know how many people's data you\r\nreceived?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I never received any data from the insurance company.\r\nWe were only privy to what data points existed in its database. It probably\r\ntold us how many individuals were in its database, and I can look through\r\nmy emails if you are interested.\r\n\r\nJo Stevens: It would be really helpful to know that.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course.\r\n\r\nQ1590 Chair: How was it planned that Facebook data would be used? Would\r\nthat be gathered during the course of the campaign and added to the\r\ntraining set, or was there Facebook data that was accessible already?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: When I sat with their social media team we looked at\r\nundertaking surveys on Facebook—it was similar to what Cambridge\r\nAnalytica or the SCL Group had done in the past. I believe that they began\r\nto do those surveys on Facebook without us, from what I understand from\r\nwhat they have said to the media, but usually Facebook would just be\r\nused in terms of their targeting tools.\r\n\r\nYou upload a certain database and that matches individuals within\r\nFacebook, and then you can target a lookalike audience to those people,\r\nand find even more individuals who are as similar as possible to the\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nindividuals that you already know are likely to be interested in leaving the\r\nEuropean Union.\r\n\r\nQ1591 Chair: I believe Leave.EU said that a lot of the work it did after it didn't\r\nget the designation was through Facebook pages, and getting people to\r\nsign up and register interest on the Leave.EU website. Presumably, it was\r\ngetting contact emails and addresses from Facebook users that they\r\ncould then match against their data set to identify people in the data set\r\nagainst their Facebook profile and use that as the basis of targeting them\r\nand other Facebook users who had similar favourable opinions.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That should have been the way that they were doing it,\r\nbut it was an undertaking by Cambridge Analytica so I can't say for sure\r\nwhat the exact methodology was.\r\n\r\nQ1592 Chair: For our benefit, to be effective in this space, how big a working\r\nset do you need to use that to create the basis for targeting the whole\r\ncountry in terms of voting?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe that the algorithms that we built for Cambridge\r\nAnalytica used at least 400 variables, and it would be very difficult to have\r\nthousands of data points on individuals in the United Kingdom. Therefore\r\nthe models would be scientifically less accurate than what you can produce\r\nin the United States, for instance. I am not a data scientist, so I would not\r\nbe able to say the minimum number of data points that you would require,\r\nbut I do know that, for instance, there are other data science\r\nconsultancies that will build an algorithm with 50 variables.\r\n\r\nQ1593 Chair: But how many individuals do you need to have profiled as part of\r\nyour working set in order to use that as a model to help you to target\r\neffectively others who are like them, and through them reach most of the\r\nelectorate in an election? How big a sample set of individuals do you need\r\nto work from in order to achieve a successful campaign?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: You would want millions in a country the size of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, at minimum, and to be talking to tens of thousands of\r\npeople to complete surveys. But it depends what level of accuracy you\r\nwould be interested in having. Some people are fine with less than 95%\r\nconfidence rate, for example. It depends how exact you need to be.\r\n\r\nQ1594 Chair: But you still need a big group.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, but that can be achieved by licensing data sets\r\nfrom a company like Experian, where that is based on the entire country's\r\ncredit profile. In the United States, that gives us basically everybody\r\nabove the age of 18—240 million Americans—just from going to one\r\nsource.\r\n\r\nQ1595 Chair: I would like to follow on from that and your experience of the Ted\r\nCruz campaign. There was a lot of talk in the referendum about the value\r\nof door-to-door canvassing techniques and the ability to feed that data\r\nback into the system, but is the purpose of that not just to support voter\r\nturnout on election day, with people going around knocking on doors—\r\nhistorically what canvassing has been there for—but to enrich the overall\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\ndata set that is being used during the campaign to target people with\r\ndigital messages?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I would say that these days it is much more important\r\nfor data collection than turnout specifically. Turnout messages can be\r\ntargeted to those individuals without a person going to speak to them in\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nQ1596 Ian C. Lucas: We know that there was contact between Facebook and\r\nCambridge Analytica about the use of data. I think it was in 2015, from\r\nmemory. Did you know about that at the time?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes. The first time that I heard anything about Facebook\r\ndata, in writing or even in a personal conversation, which didn't have to do\r\nwith those personality quizzes, was late April 2015. Facebook had\r\nannounced to all of its clients, and therefore to its clients' clients, that it\r\nwas going to close its personal data API, which allowed apps and their\r\nclients to have access to this data. Before the closing of this access, my\r\nchief data officer gave me and two of my colleagues a list of thousands of\r\ndifferent groups on Facebook and asked us to choose 500 of them that we\r\nthought having information of the individuals who like those groups would\r\nbe useful in our modelling for our new commercial business, which I was\r\nhelping grow. So we chose 500 of those groups and turned that into what\r\nI suppose is now GSR, although I wasn't aware of who we were getting\r\nthem from at the time, in order to get the data of those individuals who\r\nliked the groups that we chose. We received that data and turned in that\r\nrequest on 5 May, 2015. If Facebook actually closed that API in April,\r\neither a company contracted with Facebook was contravening their legal\r\nobligations or they were selling us old data—I am not sure.\r\n\r\nSeven months later, in December 2015, an individual from Facebook\r\ncontacted Cambridge Analytica to ask if we still had any Facebook data\r\nsets that we had received from Professor Kogan or GSR. We replied that\r\nyes, we had, but we had an agreement with GSR to have that data. Now,\r\nFacebook's agreement with GSR apparently said something different, that\r\nit wasn't meant to have the data and therefore any of its clients were no\r\nlonger meant to have the data, so we agreed to delete it, but our chief\r\ndata officer specifically said, \"We haven't contravened any contractual\r\nobligations, but at your request we are happy to delete it.\" That deletion\r\nwas apparently made in January 2016, which is quite a long time after no\r\none was supposed to have access to those data sets any more. I find it\r\nincredibly irresponsible that a company with as much money as\r\nFacebook—until a couple of weeks ago it was worth $500 billion—had no\r\ndue diligence mechanisms in place for protecting the data of British\r\ncitizens, American citizens or their users in general.\r\n\r\nSomething else of note is that in March 2016 I was copied into a back and\r\nforth conversation—\r\n\r\nQ1597 Ian C. Lucas: Before you go on, how do you know that in January 2016\r\nthe data was deleted?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't know that it was deleted. I know that our chief\r\ndata officer said it was deleted—to Facebook.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Okay, thank you.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That was forwarded to me willingly in order to help deal\r\nwith the questions from our clients around PR issues, because The\r\nGuardian had reported on this issue.\r\n\r\nIn March 2016, six or eight weeks after our chief data officer said that\r\nthose data sets were deleted, I had an email from one of our senior data\r\nscientists responding to a question that said that we were actually using\r\nFacebook-like data in our modelling. So that seems quite strange to me: if\r\nwe had deleted all of the Facebook data sets, how we were still using that\r\nfor modelling in March.\r\n\r\nQ1598 Ian C. Lucas: So your suspicion is that someone might have been\r\ncontinuing to use the Facebook data in March 2016.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes. That is only upon reflection.\r\n\r\nQ1599 Ian C. Lucas: Okay. I understand that. Furthermore, on Facebook taking\r\nsteps to ensure that the assurance they were given by Cambridge\r\nAnalytica that the information had been deleted, you are not aware of\r\nthem actually checking that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: They did not come and check that at all. That was the\r\nfinal communication, I believe, on the topic.\r\n\r\nQ1600 Chair: I know Paul Farrelly wants to come in, but I want to finish off on\r\nFacebook, if that's okay. Facebook said that it believed that Aleksandr\r\nKogan had access to data profiles on up to 1 million people in the UK. Did\r\nyou ever get any sense of how many UK profiles were part of the data set\r\nthat Aleksandr Kogan had collected?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No. I didn't even know who Professor Kogan was when I\r\njoined the company. Once he was mentioned in an email, where he was\r\nreferred to as Alex Kogan, a psychologist that we work with. I actually did\r\nnot know much about him or GSR at all, so a lot of this is new information\r\nto me, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nQ1601 Chair: But with Cambridge Analytica, did you get any sense of how much\r\nFacebook profile data it had related to UK users of the platform?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was told that we never had any data on UK citizens,\r\nbecause I was constantly pitching for commercial contracts here and I did\r\nnot really have much to back up my proposals that said that we could\r\nundertake similar kinds of work as we did in the United States.\r\n\r\nQ1602 Chair: You said that you were asked to look through lists of Facebook\r\ngroups and choose 500. Why groups as opposed to pages or profiles?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't know. I suppose there was just a good source of\r\ndata. If people liked this particular group, it was a topic that they were\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\ninterested in. That ranged from restaurants to pop stars to anything you\r\ncan imagine. It was personal interest.\r\n\r\nQ1603 Chair: Are groups more open? Is it easier to see who has joined various\r\ngroups if it is an open group rather than on a page?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That's possible, yes.\r\n\r\nChair: It's interesting. It's an issue we've raised with Facebook before.\r\nNext week I am sure we will do the significance of Facebook groups as a\r\nmeans of analysing user behaviour and disseminating information. In their\r\nofficial responses to us, they always downplay the significance of groups\r\nand focus more on pages and on profiles. I just find it interesting that that\r\nwas particularly highlighted in your case.\r\n\r\nQ1604 Ian C. Lucas: Can I follow up on the groups question? Does the data\r\nrelating to the groups only relate to people who like the group or is it\r\npeople who have visited the group as well?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: As far as I know, we were only receiving data from\r\nindividuals who had liked the group.\r\n\r\nQ1605 Paul Farrelly: On this strand, you said earlier that it is not as easy to\r\nget as many data points—I assume that means bits of information—on\r\nUK citizens as in the US. Why do you say that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Because the US is, by default, an opt-in country, and\r\nEuropean nations are, by default, opt-out. Someone has to opt in for you\r\nto hold their data or to use it for particular purposes in this country, which\r\nmeans that there are a lot of data sets that are never collected and never\r\nheld that are collected by default in the United States and cannot be sold\r\non, licensed and modelled.\r\n\r\nQ1606 Paul Farrelly: But you also say in your evidence: \"it's important also to\r\nemphasise that during most of my time at Cambridge Analytica, the\r\nculture and assumptions of the firm and the wider data brokerage and ad\r\ntech industries within which it operated were a bit 'Wild West', with\r\ncitizens' data being scraped, resold and modelled willy-nilly.\" How does\r\nthat fit with your statement about UK citizens?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That's what Alexander used to say about the United\r\nStates, which is why, even though the headquarters was in London, he\r\nsaid that now is the time to enter into business in the United States as\r\nquickly as possible, while the data laws were still \"Wild West\".\r\n\r\nQ1607 Paul Farrelly: Okay, so while that may have been Cambridge Analytica's\r\nattitude, it may not have been the same attitude held by other companies\r\nhere that hold data on individuals, such as Experian, in sharing it with\r\nother companies.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It's just that the data laws in the United Kingdom do not\r\nallow for a lot of the data work that can be easily undertaken in the US.\r\n\r\nQ1608 Paul Farrelly: So other companies might have been more ethical than\r\nCambridge Analytica?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I would hope so.\r\n\r\nQ1609 Paul Farrelly: A second question: presumably, when you were pitching\r\nto Leave.EU, it would have occurred to you to propose incorporating the\r\ndata UKIP had collected on people from their canvassing and other\r\nactivities. That was part of the proposal, was it?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It was only a part of the proposal after I had given a\r\nseparate proposal for UKIP, Leave.EU and Eldon Insurance. I was then\r\nasked by Arron Banks if there could possibly be either a costs saving or a\r\nbenefit to running a joint programme.\r\n\r\nQ1610 Paul Farrelly: Did it occur to you, or were there any other discussions,\r\nabout possibly getting data from other political sources—for instance,\r\nfrom the constituencies of Brexit-friendly MPs, be they Conservative,\r\nLabour or otherwise?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That would have been helpful, although most of those\r\nMPs would have had to run an opt-in programme for the individuals who\r\nsupported them who they held data on. If you ask people to opt in for that\r\nparticular kind of campaign, you are unlikely to get a great response.\r\n\r\nQ1611 Paul Farrelly: Did it occur, or did you discuss—possibly at HQ level—that\r\nthere are officials of different parties who take different views on Brexit,\r\nand that you could perhaps gain access to data held by any party's\r\npolitical hQ, be it Labour, UKIP or Conservative?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: The only reason it was so easy to engage with the UK\r\nIndependence party was that it was the only party that fully supported\r\nonly one campaign. Every other party was divided on party lines.\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: Or neutral.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Or neutral.\r\n\r\nQ1612 Paul Farrelly: You are not aware of any approaches, successful or\r\notherwise, to friendly MPs or party headquarters?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I am not aware of that, although we—I say \"we\", but I\r\nmean Leave.EU—contracted the famous demographer Ian Warren in order\r\nto explore the types of data available about Labour voters and how that\r\ncould be used in their communications campaigns.\r\n\r\nQ1613 Paul Farrelly: I'm talking about the canvassing data that we have.\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't believe—\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: We have Experian data, but it tends to tell us what we\r\nalready know about where people live, quite frankly, in terms of their\r\ncategories.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: As far as I know, those communications never took\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nChair: Thank you very much. We are going to move on to asking\r\nquestions about some of the other work you have done aside from the\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nreferendum campaign. Paul is going to start us off with that, and then we\r\nwill come on to Chris.\r\n\r\nQ1614 Paul Farrelly: I want to talk about your evidence about Nigeria. In that\r\nevidence, you quite rightly say that opposition research is part and parcel\r\nof politics, and that you were introduced to a suitable opposition research\r\ncompany, which was not called Black Cube. What was it called?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't remember, to be honest. I never had a contract\r\nwith that company. I introduced them to the client and they contracted\r\nindividually.\r\n\r\nQ1615 Paul Farrelly: But they were suitable?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: As far as they presented to me, but I did not know any\r\nother opposition research companies that had experience in Nigeria.\r\n\r\nQ1616 Paul Farrelly: You can't remember the name?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, but I can try to find it for you.\r\n\r\nQ1617 Paul Farrelly: Please. Obviously, legitimate opposition research does not\r\ninclude hacking into people's personal details, medical records or\r\nanything else that might be embarrassing, including criminal records or\r\nwhatever might be available. There was a report in The Guardian\r\nregarding this now infamous company, Black Cube. I will quote it. It was\r\nin The Guardian on 21 March this year: \"Staff working on the\r\ncampaign\"—this is Nigeria—\"say in early 2015 they met Israeli\r\ncybersecurity contractors in Cambridge Analytica's offices in Mayfair,\r\nLondon. Employees say they were told the meeting was arranged by\r\nBrittany Kaiser, a senior director at the firm.\" Is that true?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was in touch with my team that had been in Nigeria\r\nand had been working with these people on the ground. I was not aware\r\nof what work they had done, but I did know that they were coming to\r\nheadquarters to present some information that they had obtained from the\r\nopposing campaign. They came to the office for maybe an hour one day,\r\nand plugged something into a computer to show some pieces of\r\ninformation that they had obtained from the opposing campaign.\r\n\r\nI was not working in operations on this campaign. We had a full team that\r\nwas sat in the Abuja Hilton, in fact, that was running this on the ground. It\r\nwas only a three-week campaign. This was not a campaign of much\r\nsignificance, to be honest, but they had obtained some documents that\r\nsaid that the other candidate had visited hospitals, that the other\r\ncandidate was being consulted to by my former boss David Axelrod—he\r\nmanaged the Obama campaign when I worked there—even though David\r\nhad said in the press that he was no longer working for them, and then a\r\nlot of other miscellaneous information.\r\n\r\nThe clients did not find any of this useful at all. It resulted in one or two\r\narticles that were put out by the local campaign team in the international\r\npress that said that David Axelrod was still consulting to that campaign.\r\nNothing else came of it, and I understand that the clients did not continue\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nto hire those consultants, because they did not think that the information\r\nwas useful.\r\n\r\nQ1618 Paul Farrelly: There is further information about activities in other\r\ncountries that colleagues want to talk about, but the Israeli cybersecurity\r\ncontractors that were referred to in this Guardian article came from the\r\ncompany Black Cube, did they?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Not to my knowledge. I had never heard the name Black\r\nCube until I saw it in the press.\r\n\r\nQ1619 Paul Farrelly: Do you know what company they came from?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It would have been the same company that we were\r\ntalking about. I believe that they were campaign consultants that had\r\nworked in African elections before.\r\n\r\nQ1620 Paul Farrelly: Okay, but had they been from Black Cube without your\r\nknowledge of the name of the company that was employing them, it\r\nwould have been true to have said that you arranged this meeting in\r\nLondon?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, I was present at that meeting, and I knew that they\r\nwere coming.\r\n\r\nQ1621 Paul Farrelly: That was my next question—whether you were at the\r\nmeeting. What was your reaction to the activities that they described?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: They showed me a video of sitting in campaign meetings\r\nwith the opposition, so I was kind of surprised that they had managed to\r\nachieve that, because they were actually sitting there with the candidate\r\ncampaign manager and other high-level individuals on the campaign. I\r\nhad never seen that before from campaign consultants. I was kind of\r\nshocked that they were able to—I don't want to say \"achieve something\r\nlike that\" as if it was great, but it was definitely shocking: their skill level\r\nat going undercover and achieving that kind of trust from the other side.\r\n\r\nThey obtained data while they were in that campaign—I cannot confirm\r\nhow that was obtained, to be honest—and then they presented that to me.\r\nI did not think any of it was useful. Obviously, the name David Axelrod\r\npops out at me because I know the man personally and used to work\r\nunder his direction. That piece of data was turned into a press article.\r\nThat's all.\r\n\r\nQ1622 Paul Farrelly: Did it occur to you that that modus operandi—going\r\nundercover like that—was, if not useful, unethical?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It was something that I was quite used to in US politics.\r\nA lot of times, opposition researchers are sent to become part of local\r\ncampaign teams or to take part in local rallies and film people off camera.\r\n\r\nQ1623 Paul Farrelly: To infiltrate.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Indeed. Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1624 Paul Farrelly: So you were quite comfortable with that?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It is commonplace in politics, fortunately or\r\nunfortunately.\r\n\r\nQ1625 Paul Farrelly: Not here, I don't think, unless I am so naive that I have\r\nbeen taken for a ride for the last 20 years.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't know, but I would say questioning the ethics of it\r\nis correct, definitely, in hindsight. I am no longer interested in being\r\ninvolved with activities of that sort.\r\n\r\nQ1626 Paul Farrelly: The Guardian article I am referring to goes on to talk\r\nabout various things that were allegedly obtained by this team of cyber\r\ncontractors and the team on the ground actually then panicking and\r\npulling out. Were you aware of all that before this article?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was never aware of any panicking. I was told that\r\nwhen the election was meant to take place, which was 14 February 2015,\r\nwe had only had people there for three weeks. The election was then\r\npushed forward by a couple of weeks and the clients did not want to pay\r\nfor our contractors to stay there any longer, so they came back and did\r\nnot stay in the country all the way until election day.\r\n\r\nQ1627 Paul Farrelly: We have had copies of a pretty horrendous video that was\r\nproduced as part of that work and campaign. What sort of work on that\r\ncampaign, including that video, were you aware of?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was only aware of all of the campaign materials at the\r\nend of the campaign, when I was given the portfolio that I have given as\r\nevidence to the Committee. I do understand that there was one video that\r\nused violent images. That was specifically because I was working with a\r\nlot of individuals who did not believe that Buhari was a legitimate\r\ncandidate because he was a war criminal who had slaughtered people in\r\nthe '80s—specifically children—and burned their bodies in the streets to\r\ninitiate fear in the citizens. There were a lot of human rights lawyers who\r\nwere trying to stop him being a political candidate, and that was a\r\nreminder to anyone under the age of 30, who would not have been privy\r\nto that information—they would not have been born yet—of who that man\r\nactually was.\r\n\r\nQ1628 Paul Farrelly: So that was part of the portfolio and you were fully aware\r\nof it?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: At the end, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1629 Paul Farrelly: Of the campaign?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: After it had already been pushed out and used, then I\r\nwas made aware of the full campaign portfolio, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1630 Chair: On the particular film that Mr Farrelly refers to, the core message\r\nwas actually that he would establish sharia law in Nigeria and that people\r\nwould face punishment beatings and death as a consequence of extreme\r\nsharia law being introduced into the country, more than his previous\r\nrecord. That's correct, isn't it?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: You can look through all of the videos in the portfolio—\r\nthere were quite a few—but I did not produce them and I was not aware\r\nof them being produced.\r\n\r\nQ1631 Paul Farrelly: But you saw them afterwards?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I saw them afterwards, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1632 Paul Farrelly: You saw them afterwards. But this was in, what, 2015?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1633 Paul Farrelly: Did they not make you feel uncomfortable?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1634 Paul Farrelly: But you stayed at Cambridge Analytica until 2018.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I did, but a decision that would have been made by a\r\ncontractor who did not even work for our company full time who was\r\nrunning that campaign—a gentleman under the name of Sam Patten—had\r\nnothing to do with the rest of the company. That was one video among\r\nabout 50 or 60 pieces of creative that were put in local newspapers, radio,\r\nFacebook and Twitter. It was not concerning enough for me to quit my\r\nfull-time job, no.\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: People might take a different view, but it depends on their\r\npersonalities, of course. I have a few more questions, but Ian wants to\r\ncome in.\r\n\r\nQ1635 Ian C. Lucas: Sorry, just picking up on this point, when Mr Nix gave\r\nevidence I asked him to produce one example of a piece of work that\r\nCambridge Analytica had rejected on ethical grounds. He said he would\r\ncome back to me, and he has since come back and said he cannot\r\nproduce one example of a piece of work that he rejected on ethical\r\ngrounds. Have you ever rejected anything on ethical grounds, in terms of\r\ncampaigns, at Cambridge Analytica?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I have never been under authority to say yes or no to\r\nany piece of creative. I was not in campaign operations.\r\n\r\nQ1636 Ian C. Lucas: We have heard about this particular example. Are there\r\nany other examples that made you uncomfortable?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I have been offered introductions to clients that I\r\nrefused to meet with, such as the Alternative for Germany and Marine Le\r\nPen's campaign. I refused to even get on a phone call with them.\r\n\r\nQ1637 Ian C. Lucas: But not UKIP?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Not UKIP, no.\r\n\r\nQ1638 Chair: Can I ask who asked you to meet with AfD and with Marine Le\r\nPenn?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe it could have been the same individual who\r\nintroduced us to the UK Independence Party, but I am not sure because I\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nwas not introduced to them directly. The introductions were suggested\r\nthat they could be made.\r\n\r\nQ1639 Chair: You are talking about Steve Bannon, so was it suggested to you\r\nthat Steve Bannon could make an introduction to both Marine Le Pen and\r\nAlternative for Germany?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It was— I do believe we were actually introduced via\r\nemail to one of the communications officers for Alternative for Germany. I\r\nwould have to check who made that introduction.\r\n\r\nIt was offered that Marine Le Pen's campaign could be introduced to us; I\r\ndon't think I was ever told who that introduction was going to be made by.\r\nI think it was Julian Wheatland who asked if we wanted the introduction—\r\nor asked one of my colleagues who spoke French if we wanted the\r\nintroduction—and we had a meeting about it and decided no.\r\n\r\nQ1640 Chair: Okay, but why do believe that Steve Bannon was involved in that\r\nprocess?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Because I don't believe that Julian had connections to\r\nany of these parties.\r\n\r\nQ1641 Chair: The one person who does have connections to those parties, apart\r\nfrom Steve Bannon, is Nigel Farage. Do you believe he—?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It's possible.\r\n\r\nQ1642 Chair: But you weren't told that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I wasn't told that, but I can look back in my emails and\r\nsee if an individual is referenced, yes.\r\n\r\nChair: That would be helpful. Thank you.\r\n\r\nQ1643 Paul Farrelly: I've just got a few more questions. They are curiosity\r\nquestions, Chair, if you'll just allow me.\r\n\r\nMiss Kaiser, you seem to have travelled a long way, from being an\r\nidealistic intern in Barack Obama's campaign to working for a number of\r\nyears for an organisation that keeps pretty unsavoury company in\r\nwishing to make pitches—let's leave Nigeria to one side—to far-right\r\npolitical parties, whether or not you turn them down. Didn't that make\r\nyou at all uncomfortable?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, which is why I agreed to never work in operations\r\nfor those campaigns. Meeting with those people is very different from\r\nactually crafting and pushing out those messages in terms of personal,\r\nemotional attachment.\r\n\r\nI originally joined the company because I had been frustrated for many\r\nyears while working on campaigns for human rights and for liberal parties\r\nthat I supported that were unsuccessful or unmeasurable. The Strategic\r\nCommunications Laboratory has always boasted of being able to measure\r\neffectiveness of campaigns. I joined to help grow their social division—so,\r\nbeing able to use science of communications in order to achieve better\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nresults for UN agencies, NGOs, CBOs or parties that I supported was very\r\ninteresting for me, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1644 Paul Farrelly: Forgive me for my ignorance. You make reference to a\r\ntime in March when you first spoke to The Guardian. When was that? Was\r\nthat after their article about Nigeria?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I think it within 48 hours of that, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1645 Paul Farrelly: So it was after that. Was it after Mr Nix had been\r\nsuspended?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't think so, no.\r\n\r\nQ1646 Paul Farrelly: Okay. We can do the timeline. Can I just ask you a very\r\npersonal question? How old are you?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I am 30 years old.\r\n\r\nQ1647 Paul Farrelly: You're 30 years old. You are very lucky to be 30. I don't\r\nknow much about your background, but in your emails you've got, PhD\r\ncandidate, MPhil, LLM, MA (Hons). Could you tell us the background of all\r\nthose?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course. I moved to Edinburgh in 2005 to undertake\r\nan MA with honours in international relations—that was what would be\r\nconsidered a three-year undergrad, one-year masters, but one MA. Then I\r\nwent to University of London, Birkbeck, to undertake an LLM in\r\ninternational human rights law, which I completed. Then I went to\r\nMiddlesex University to do an MPhil and a PhD in international law and\r\nhuman rights; the topic was preventive diplomacy to stop atrocity crimes.\r\nI did the first year and a half, which was the MPhil, then passed into the\r\nPhD and did the first two and a half years. I was still writing that PhD\r\nwhile I was working for Alexander Nix. He asked me if I would put that on\r\nhold in order to dedicate myself fully to work for the company.\r\n\r\nQ1648 Paul Farrelly: And it was during those studies that you volunteered for\r\nthe Obama campaign.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1649 Paul Farrelly: Your CV also says that, in between times, you established\r\nan inward investment company in Libya.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I did, yes. It was called the Pace Group. I had written\r\nabout Libya for years in my human rights works, and I wanted to go there\r\nto do human rights research for my upcoming degree. Unfortunately, you\r\ncan't get a visa to do that. In some of the conferences that I attended, I\r\nmet somebody who was doing business with a media company based in\r\nTripoli and London, and they invited me to be part of a new company they\r\nwere starting, which I joined. That was the Pace Group.\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: P-A-C-E?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: P-A-C-E, yes. I joined that company, which was based\r\nbetween Tripoli and London in order to put together international\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nconferences that would bring together politicians and businesspeople to\r\ntalk about renegotiating diplomatic relations post-Gaddafi era and\r\nrenegotiating Gaddafi-era investment contracts, with the hope of\r\nstabilising the country after the revolution.\r\n\r\nQ1650 Paul Farrelly: And what happened to that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It was successful for about a year and a half, until I was\r\nhired out of that company by a gentleman called Michael Thomas, who ran\r\nPathfinder Trade and Invest—a UKTI-partnered trade association. I\r\nbecame director of operations of that company about a year and a half\r\ninto working for the Pace Group.\r\n\r\nQ1651 Paul Farrelly: And last year you got involved in something called Bueno\r\nCapital.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: Which is not a chocolate company.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, it isn't. It's a blockchain advisory and development\r\nfirm out of Zurich.\r\n\r\nQ1652 Paul Farrelly: And that was while you were working for Cambridge\r\nAnalytica.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, it was. One of the reasons why Alexander and I\r\ncould not come to an agreement about what a consultancy role for me\r\nwould look like was that I don't believe he thought I could help grow a\r\nnew company as well as working for him.\r\n\r\nQ1653 Paul Farrelly: And was he involved in that? Have you got any business\r\nrelationships or personal relationships with Alexander Nix?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Not at the moment, no.\r\n\r\nQ1654 Paul Farrelly: But you might have in the future.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Right now, it would be rather uncomfortable to do so.\r\n\r\nQ1655 Paul Farrelly: I just want to ask a final question. I used to be a\r\njournalist, and this is a question that would occur to me to ask of any\r\nsource or anyone giving testimony like this. You have been very active in\r\nyour life on all different sides of lots of fences. Don't take this the wrong\r\nway; it is a standard question. In your life, have you ever worked for,\r\npaid or unpaid, or provided information to, any country's intelligence\r\nagency, their representatives or associated organisations, or otherwise\r\nacted in any way that would mean that you might be reasonably\r\ndescribed as an intelligence service asset or resource?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, although I was travelling to a lot of countries that\r\nwere of interest to the US Government, so whenever I came back to DC, I\r\nwould brief the State Department on where I had been, who I had met\r\nwith and what I had done, but that was the State Department, not an\r\nintelligence agency.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ1656 Paul Farrelly: And have you ever been approached—it's not your fault if\r\nyou have been—by any intelligence agencies or their representatives, to\r\nask you to work for them or provide information to them?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe that I have, although they wouldn't properly\r\nidentify themselves. I have been taught what to look out for. My\r\ngrandfather was a military intelligence officer for 27 years and knew, when\r\nI was young, that that would be a possibility. He told me what to look out\r\nfor and to say no.\r\n\r\nQ1657 Paul Farrelly: Just a final question. You are a US national?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, only.\r\n\r\nQ1658 Paul Farrelly: No joint nationalities?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No.\r\n\r\nQ1659 Christian Matheson: I want to take you back to the Nigerian work that\r\nyou did. Was that the first work you undertook for SCL?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That was the first contract I won for the company, yes.\r\nIt wasn't the first work that I tried to work on. Yes, that was the first\r\nsuccessful contract that I won. It was my job to win contracts.\r\n\r\nQ1660 Christian Matheson: You were working on behalf of the Goodluck\r\nJonathan campaign.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Not on behalf of the campaign, no. This was more of a\r\ncrisis communications campaign on behalf of private individuals who did\r\nnot believe that Buhari was the right candidate for the country. Goodluck\r\nJonathan's campaign didn't know we were in the country.\r\n\r\nQ1661 Christian Matheson: I understand that your name is on an email to a\r\nLibyan individual whose Nigerian business partner paid SCL for that work.\r\nIs that right?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That is correct, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1662 Christian Matheson: It has been alleged to me that on this matter you\r\nalso worked with somebody called Chase Ergen, from St Kitts and Nevis.\r\nDoes that sound familiar?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I do know him, yes. He is not from St Kitts; he is\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nQ1663 Christian Matheson: It has also been alleged to me that the fellow who\r\npaid SCL for this work was rewarded by being given a diplomatic passport\r\nfrom Dominica as a result of that. Is that anything you know about?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I do know that the clients who paid us to undertake that\r\nwork in Nigeria met with the Prime Minister of that country in Davos\r\nduring January of that year.\r\n\r\nQ1664 Christian Matheson: Do you have any idea what happened at that\r\nmeeting?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No.\r\n\r\nQ1665 Christian Matheson: It has been alleged to me that a diplomatic\r\npassport was obtained by the Nigerian fellow who was paying you for\r\nthis, and that a payment was made to the Dominican Prime Minister,\r\nRoosevelt Skerrit.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That is the correct Prime Minister, yes. I believe these\r\nclients were quite scared of what would happen if Buhari were to become\r\npresident. Again, that was a consistent message throughout their entire\r\nengagement with us—that they were scared for their lives and their\r\nfamilies' lives. I was involved in helping to set up that meeting where they\r\ncould explore having an option to leave the country with their families to\r\nsomewhere safe if their lives were to be threatened, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1666 Christian Matheson: Okay, thank you for that. This was the person who\r\nwas also paying you? The Nigerian fellow was the one who was paying\r\nSCL?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, that is correct.\r\n\r\nQ1667 Christian Matheson: Can I just clarify something from your written\r\nstatement? A couple of colleagues have asked about this today, but I\r\nwant to clarify something in my own mind. On Brexit, you have given\r\nEldon Insurance in your written evidence. You say, \"Cambridge Analytica\r\nwas initially engaged with Arron Banks, Andy Wigmore and Matthew\r\nRichardson to design parallel proposals for Leave.EU, GoSkippy/Eldon\r\nInsurance and the UK Independence Party.\" You are talking about having\r\nparallel proposals, but did Messrs Banks, Wigmore and Richardson\r\napproach you together, or did they all happen to approach you\r\nindividually?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: My first meeting was with all of them in one room, and\r\nLiz Bilney.\r\n\r\nQ1668 Christian Matheson: And were they all there representing Leave.EU,\r\nGoSkippy/Eldon Insurance and the UK Independence party, or was one\r\nrepresenting Leave.EU, one representing GoSkippy and one representing\r\nUKIP?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe that all of them at the time were representing\r\nLeave.EU, and that was the main conversation. Julian Wheatland and I had\r\nprepared a pitch for Leave.EU, and those were the individuals in\r\nattendance. Now, just like many of our other clients around the world, if\r\nthey were going to engage with us on one project, some people would ask\r\nfor a saving if they were to do multiple projects with us, which we have\r\noffered to people in the past. I think when they saw the numbers we were\r\nasking for, they started to look at other work we could do, and also\r\nstarted to look at where else we would be able to get data, as Leave.EU\r\ndid not have any data when they first approached us.\r\n\r\nQ1669 Christian Matheson: Right, so there are three individuals and three\r\norganisations, and one organisation, Leave.EU, is the lead organisation,\r\nbut the three individuals are also looking collectively at the other two\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\norganisations and how they could be involved?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, we definitely had multiple conversations about how\r\neach project could benefit the other.\r\n\r\nQ1670 Christian Matheson: Did you appear and give a presentation at the\r\nlaunch of Leave.EU?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nQ1671 Christian Matheson: You must have been a bit disappointed, then,\r\nwhen you subsequently did not do any work for them?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: When we did not do any further work for them after that\r\nday, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1672 Christian Matheson: So you had done some work? What was the nature\r\nof the work that you had done so far?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: We had taken receipt of UK Independence party data\r\nand the survey data to do modelling and analysis that would inform\r\nLeave.EU communications. Now we were waiting for the legal opinion on\r\nhow that could be used and we were given that on the day of the launch. I\r\ndon't know if the rest of that data was ever combined with Leave.EU\r\ncampaign data, although Andy Wigmore and Arron Banks's statement to\r\nthe press would suggest so.\r\n\r\nQ1673 Christian Matheson: But you were surprised, having appeared on that\r\nplatform, not then to be taken on a little bit further?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, and for Arron Banks to have never paid any invoice\r\nor signed a contract, although I wasn't on a commission structure for the\r\ncompany, so it didn't make any personal difference to me.\r\n\r\nQ1674 Christian Matheson: Can I then take you to this invoice we have been\r\nlooking at this morning, for £41,500? Was it ever paid?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I understand from the press two days ago that Arron\r\nBanks made a donation to UKIP for the amount of £42,000 a week before\r\nthe vote. I don't know if that was housekeeping in relation to that\r\nparticular invoice, though when a representative from UKIP was asked\r\nabout it, they said yes, they received that donation, which I believe was to\r\ncover that invoice. They just decided not to pass on the funds to\r\nCambridge Analytica. I believe that through making that transfer they\r\nwere admitting that work was done that needed to be paid for.\r\n\r\nQ1675 Christian Matheson: But did the money ever reach Cambridge\r\nAnalytica?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No.\r\n\r\nQ1676 Christian Matheson: So why did Cambridge Analytica just shrug their\r\nshoulders and leave it at that? Forty-one thousand pounds seems quite a\r\nfair chunk to me.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Not for our company at the time. We were pitching for\r\nmuch larger sums of work. It became clear that that wasn't going to\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nhappen, £500,000 to £800,000-something. We were really hoping that\r\nthat was the work that was going to be agreed upon. After contractual\r\ndisputes and not getting them to sign the contract, not getting them to\r\npay their invoice, eventually those conversations fizzled out, although I\r\ndon't think we stopped trying to get that money until even maybe after\r\nthe referendum vote.\r\n\r\nQ1677 Christian Matheson: Did you ever consider legal action?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I remember there were conversations about possibly\r\nputting the money in escrow until we maybe did more work for them. I\r\ndon't think that ever happened. I questioned why no legal action was\r\ntaken and I questioned why our company felt the need never to talk about\r\nthis particular issue that we had with potential clients who never signed on\r\nthe dotted line and so who were never official clients. I feel no need to\r\nprotect them. I don't know if anyone at Cambridge Analytica felt the need\r\nto protect them for some reason.\r\n\r\nQ1678 Christian Matheson: It doesn't sound a very reputable way to go about\r\nbusiness. If you have done the work for them, you can be fairly expected\r\nto get the money off them.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, well, because they never signed the contract, we\r\nnever turned in the report. I only used the report to brief and work with\r\nthe teams that were relevant to making use of that information, which I\r\nwould normally say would be chargeable days of consultancy. But no, I\r\nnever handed over the report at the request of my superiors.\r\n\r\nQ1679 Christian Matheson: Okay, and £41,000 in the great scheme of things\r\nwasn't that much and business was potentially booming at the time?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: In the United States, yes. We had no other\r\nengagements in the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nQ1680 Christian Matheson: The correspondence address for Cambridge\r\nAnalytica LLC on that invoice is Suite 1000, 8383 Wilshire Boulevard. Is\r\nthat correct?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Oh yes, that was our address in Arlington—not in\r\nArlington; in Virginia, was it?\r\n\r\nChristian Matheson: I think so, yes.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, I helped to open that office in Virginia—in\r\nAlexandria, exactly—which was our DC office until we moved to 1901\r\nPennsylvania Avenue, which is where it is currently.\r\n\r\nQ1681 Christian Matheson: Is that 8383 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 1000, the\r\nsame address as Breitbart?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, Breitbart offices— I don't know where their main\r\noffice is, but they definitely had an office that I've been to before, in the\r\nbasement of a building called The Embassy on Capitol Hill, which Steve\r\nBannon lived in. I have never been to any other Breitbart offices, but that\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nparticular building was rented, I think, only by Cambridge Analytica—at\r\nleast our floor was rented.\r\n\r\nQ1682 Christian Matheson: I am informed that Suite 1000 is the registered\r\noffice of Freemark Financial Services and that Breitbart is also registered\r\nthere. Does that ring any bells?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, I believe there are only employees of SCL USA\r\nrepresenting Cambridge Analytica that were working out of that office. I\r\nwas there for nine months.\r\n\r\nQ1683 Christian Matheson: Did you come across a company there called\r\nGlittering Steel, a film production company?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I believe that was Steve Bannon's production company.\r\n\r\nQ1684 Christian Matheson: Were they registered at the same office?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, I think they worked out of The Embassy. They could\r\nhave been registered there, I have no idea about the registration\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nQ1685 Christian Matheson: Can I move on now? A couple of colleagues—Mr\r\nFarrelly, for example—talked about the stuff you are doing at the\r\nmoment. Are you still advising Siglo?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1686 Christian Matheson: Can you tell us a little bit about that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, it's a blockchain protocol for allowing individuals to\r\nmonetise their own data and be rewarded in tokens that are traded for air\r\ntime. Basically, there is an app that takes control of your log screen and\r\nshows you targeted content. You decide what data you want to share with\r\nthe app and it will show you content accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to watch that content or answer surveys, you are rewarded\r\nin tokens that pay for your phone bill. About 1.2 million individuals in\r\nMexico and Colombia use that. The app is actually called Pig.gi. They put\r\ntokens in your Pig.gi bank that you use to pay for your phone bill. There\r\nare also families who use that for remittances, so they earn tokens to pay\r\nfor their families' phone bills.\r\n\r\nQ1687 Christian Matheson: Why Mexico and Colombia?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: My friends, who co-founded the company, have spent a\r\nlot of their lives in Mexico. It is one of the reasons that I asked Alexander\r\nNix over and over for years if I could open up a Mexico City office. I have a\r\nlot of friends who live there and it is a lot cheaper to open a technology\r\ncompany there in terms of staffing and office and everything. The\r\ntechnology industry there is also quite underdeveloped compared with the\r\nUnited States, so it is a lot easier to pitch and win contracts. Although it\r\ntakes longer to negotiate them, there is not very much competition in\r\nthose markets.\r\n\r\nQ1688 Christian Matheson: But it is registered in Gibraltar. It is Pig.gi, isn't it?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1689 Christian Matheson: Why is it registered in Gibraltar, if everybody is\r\nworking in Mexico and Colombia?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Because it is a blockchain company. Right now,\r\nblockchain is not regulated in a straightforward way. So, if you register in\r\na location that already has laws that govern the use of digital assets on\r\nthe blockchain, you can understand what your legal implications are. But\r\nin countries that have not yet legislated on that—in Mexico the new\r\nFinTech laws have not yet been approved by the President—you are not\r\nsure what judgments are going to be made about your company, when\r\nthere are no laws yet about it.\r\n\r\nQ1690 Christian Matheson: So you are operating in countries B and C but you\r\nare operating under the laws of country A.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Well, there are no laws about the technology that is\r\nbeing used. It is too new. Mexico has no legislation on it at the moment.\r\n\r\nQ1691 Christian Matheson: Does Cambridge Analytica have a shareholding in\r\nPig.gi?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No. There was an investment that was offered and also\r\nback-end work for building out some of the database and infrastructure\r\nthat was offered. That relationship was severed due to the inability of\r\nCambridge Analytica to handle their data obligations properly. That\r\ncompany was not interested in going with a company that could not\r\nguarantee that their users' data would be protected.\r\n\r\nQ1692 Christian Matheson: There are presidential elections coming up this\r\nyear in Colombia. I take it that none of the activities that you have been\r\ninvolved in so far will have a political angle to them in terms of data\r\nsharing or data activity in Colombia.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No. I was in contact with three of the presidential\r\ncampaigns in Colombia but we never even did a pitch or a meeting, let\r\nalone an undertaking, for any work there. I have never even been to\r\nColombia. SCL and Cambridge have no business in Colombia whatsoever.\r\n\r\nQ1693 Christian Matheson: Mowisat—what is that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It's one of my friends' satellite telecommunications\r\ncompanies in Mexico. More than half of Mexico does not have access to the\r\ninternet at home. In the rural areas it would cost the Government billions\r\nof dollars to build up that infrastructure. So, this company designed a\r\nprogramme where you could use cheap and portable satellite dishes to set\r\nup in areas where, for quite a wide radius, you would be able to\r\ntriangulate satellite signals and give wi-fi access to individuals. They had\r\nnever had it before.\r\n\r\nQ1694 Christian Matheson: Does it involve harvesting data? Is there a data-\r\nharvesting aspect to it?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I suppose there could be, but right now there isn't, no.\r\nIt could be used for that, if the software that was used for accessing the\r\nwireless had a data-collection method—that's the same with any wireless\r\nyou use anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nQ1695 Christian Matheson: With any of these current activities, do you still\r\nhave a business relationship with Alexander Nix?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, I don't.\r\n\r\nQ1696 Christian Matheson: When did you last see him?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That's a good question.\r\n\r\nQ1697 Christian Matheson: When were you last in contact with him?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I think I last saw him in Davos, at the World Economic\r\nForum.\r\n\r\nQ1698 Christian Matheson: I have a couple of final questions if I may, Chair.\r\nThere was a hack of data from Uber, the taxi firm. Have you ever come\r\nacross that data being used in any way, for example by some of the\r\npolitical campaigns?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, although Cambridge Analytica had meetings with\r\nthe CTO of Uber in California maybe a year and a half or two years ago. I\r\ndon't believe anything came of that, but a conversation was had.\r\n\r\nQ1699 Christian Matheson: One final question: you referred to having two sets\r\nof business cards—who did you work for?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: The SCL Group, technically, was my employer.\r\n\r\nQ1700 Christian Matheson: In your own mind, who did you work for?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: When I joined, I worked only for the SCL Group\r\nbecause, as a registered Democrat, I did not want to work for the\r\nRepublicans. I later joined Cambridge Analytica, mostly to help build our\r\ncommercial business out of New York.\r\n\r\nQ1701 Christian Matheson: Was there ever a time when you were working for\r\nboth entities?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Of course—at all times. As soon as I joined Cambridge\r\nAnalytica, I was still working for SCL Group. Cambridge Analytica as an\r\nentity did not employ anybody, so I was always an employee of the SCL\r\nGroup.\r\n\r\nQ1702 Christian Matheson: Which company's name was on your payslip?\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It was SCL Group, and then it turned to SCL USA.\r\n\r\nQ1703 Chair: Is it the case that one of your colleagues at Bueno Capital also\r\nworked at Mowisat and previously shared an address at Cambridge\r\nAnalytica as well? Is that a coincidence or is there a connection between\r\nthose organisations?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: We all lived together as friends in Mexico. I've known\r\nthese people for over a decade.\r\n\r\nQ1704 Chair: So it is more of a personal connection than a commercial one?\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Personal friends, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1705 Chair: I'd like to go back and ask a couple of questions about the\r\ncampaign in Nigeria, which was raised earlier. You said that you did not\r\nknow that the consultants who were hired to work on the project worked\r\nfor a part of Black Cube?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, I had never heard of the company Black Cube until\r\nit was brought to my attention in the press.\r\n\r\nQ1706 Chair: What did you know about these people when you hired them? You\r\nsaid that they had experience of working in elections in Africa; what else\r\ndid you know about them?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That they had also worked on elections or for\r\nGovernments in Latin America and that they had previously undertaken\r\nGovernment contracts for intelligence gathering.\r\n\r\nQ1707 Chair: You said that Sam Patten ran that side of the campaign. Is that\r\nright?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: He ran the SCL side of the campaign. I know that he\r\nmet those people—the other consultants-in-country. I don't know the\r\nnature of those meetings, but he was the one who was hired by the SCL\r\nGroup to run that communications campaign. He was an ad hoc consultant\r\nfor us on our global roster. He did not work for us full time.\r\n\r\nQ1708 Chair: So SCL brought Sam Patten in as a consultant to run this\r\ncampaign. Was it on Sam Patten's recommendation that these other\r\nconsultants were brought in as well?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, it was just upon my introduction, because I knew\r\nthat these people existed and that they had worked in Nigeria before. I did\r\nnot know anyone else in the world that had ever even worked in Nigeria in\r\npolitical, so I introduced them to the clients and the clients decided to\r\nstart an initial engagement. After they weren't satisfied with what they\r\nreceived from them, they did not re-engage, from what I understand.\r\n\r\nQ1709 Chair: Who introduced you to these consultants?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was introduced by some friends in Israel.\r\n\r\nQ1710 Chair: Okay. You said that these consultants had worked in intelligence\r\nbefore. There is quite a big industry of ex-intelligence officers working in\r\ncommunications. Did you believe they were ex-Mossad agents?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: They could have been, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1711 Chair: You knew that they were Israeli.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I knew they were Israeli and that they had undertaken\r\nGovernment intelligence-gathering contracts before—they had that on\r\ntheir CV, shall we say.\r\n\r\nQ1712 Chair: You said that your grandfather had been an intelligence officer.\r\nWas that in Israel or in America?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Based in the United States. He was still in infantry when\r\nhe worked in Korea and Vietnam. He came back to the United States and\r\njoined military intelligence.\r\n\r\nQ1713 Chair: In the United States?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ1714 Chair: These consultants were recommended to you; they were Israelis,\r\ntherefore there was a strong chance that they had worked in Israeli\r\nintelligence. Had you met them before or worked on any projects with\r\nthem before?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I had never worked with them before, no, but I did meet\r\nthem when I was in Israel on a trip to Tel Aviv, and that is why I knew\r\nwho they were.\r\n\r\nQ1715 Chair: Had they worked with Sam Patten before?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Not that I know of, but I would not be privy to that\r\ninformation. I had never met Sam before that, either. I met Sam for one\r\nday for one meeting where he came to London to get briefed about the\r\nproject before he went to Nigeria. I did not really know either of them very\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nQ1716 Chair: Did you take advice about any other consultancies you hired?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: We, in general, had a list of other companies that we\r\nhad worked with, or we could research other companies to suggest where\r\nconsultants could fill in for products or services that we did not offer. For\r\nexample, in terms of our relationship with AIQ, we could not offer our own\r\ndigital campaigns or our own software development, but AIQ could do that\r\non our behalf.\r\n\r\nQ1717 Chair: You said that their role was intelligence gathering. What do you\r\nunderstand that to entail?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: They had given the examples on where individuals or\r\nGovernments had been defrauded, and they were able to trace where\r\nmoney had come from in order to find criminals.\r\n\r\nQ1718 Chair: And how would they do that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I guess they would use different types of data software\r\nto trace transfers between bank accounts and follow the money, but I\r\ndon't really know how that works.\r\n\r\nQ1719 Chair: That could be called hacking, though, couldn't it?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: If you improperly access data then yes, people refer to\r\nthat as hacking.\r\n\r\nQ1720 Chair: It would be difficult to get records about people's financial\r\ntransactions by properly accessing it, because you then need the\r\npermission of their bank or the individual themselves.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I do believe that if you are working on behalf of the\r\nGovernment, you can get permissions to do financial tracing through\r\nbanks legally.\r\n\r\nQ1721 Chair: But in this case, they were not working on behalf of a\r\nGovernment; they were working on behalf of a political campaign funded\r\nby a mysterious backer.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That is true, but I do not think they did anything\r\nfinancial on the Nigeria campaign.\r\n\r\nQ1722 Chair: So you do not believe they were involved in any hacking during\r\nthe campaign of data and information about financial transactions or\r\nemails or anything else?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: If you call it hacking to go into a campaign, convince\r\nthem you are part of the campaign and then leave with data, then I\r\nsuppose it is, but I would not call it that.\r\n\r\nQ1723 Chair: How do you distinguish between the two?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Hacking usually means that you are remotely breaking\r\ninto the back end of someone's data security and getting data in that kind\r\nof way. I do not think that is how they obtained information. I think they\r\ndid it in person with permission to use the computers.\r\n\r\nQ1724 Chair: Breaking in the front end, rather than the back end.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I guess you could say that.\r\n\r\nQ1725 Chair: This does sound questionable in terms of the legality of what they\r\nwere doing and whether they were engaged in criminal acts. Does that\r\nnot concern you?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, it is concerning. I did not know what they were up\r\nto until it had already been done. Again, I did not negotiate a contract with\r\nthem or for them or send a proposal on their behalf. I just made an\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\nQ1726 Chair: Your position seems very unusual and slightly vulnerable in this\r\ncampaign. You have hired a group of people who you do not really know,\r\nwho have been introduced to you. You do not really know what they are\r\ndoing. They could be hacking or committing criminal acts—we do not\r\nreally know. There is also a dissemination of created materials to support\r\nthe campaign, of which you do not see any during the course of the\r\ncampaign. What is your role in the campaign?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: My role was to win a contract for the SCL Group. I had\r\nworked there for maybe two and a half weeks when this occurred. It was\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nquite fast paced. I was not really briefed into everything that was going on\r\nor all our products and services. I was told that my job was to win a\r\ncontract. When I was introduced to individuals who were interested in\r\npaying money for elections communications, I thought, \"Okay, that was\r\npretty quick.\" I thought it would take me months to find somebody who\r\nwas interested in that.\r\n\r\nQ1727 Chair: But you are then responsible for spending that money as well,\r\naren't you? You are hiring people, commissioning work and all the rest of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, we have someone called the senior acting director of\r\nthe project. This time we had two individuals who were in charge of doling\r\nout the money and what that is used for.\r\n\r\nQ1728 Chair: Who are they in this case?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Sam Patten was one of them—the external consultant—\r\nand our internal consultant was a woman called Ceris Bailes.\r\n\r\nQ1729 Chair: It is a very weird structure, isn't it? You have Sam Patten, who\r\ndoes not work for SCL and is brought in as a consultant and sits above\r\nyou. Then there's you. You hire in consultants who have been\r\nrecommended to you, who you do not really know. You are not\r\nresponsible for what they do, you are not responsible for the creative\r\nwork produced during the campaign, and you are not responsible for\r\nhanding out money to the different contractors, either—and you have\r\nonly been at the company for two and a half weeks. It sounds like an\r\nextraordinary organisational structure.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It does.\r\n\r\nQ1730 Chair: One where your position is either very exposed, or you are\r\ndeliberately in a position where you are being told to hire people and\r\nmove people around, without ever really knowing what is going on. It\r\nwould seem to me that a structure like that, if you were engaged in\r\ncriminal activity, was deliberately designed to limit the liability of SCL, in\r\nthis case, because so much of it was being done through contractors who\r\nwere working at arm's length, or in the dark, from the people who hired\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I would say it sounds pretty disorganised, actually, but\r\nin this case it was definitely not intentional. I went full speed ahead into a\r\nnew position where I was only a consultant, and I had a goal, which was\r\nto win these contracts and try to quickly put together the people who\r\ncould actually achieve any of the services that were being asked for by\r\nthose potential clients.\r\n\r\nPolitical campaigns all over the world are like that, because as a contractor\r\nto a political campaign, the longest you are ever going to work for\r\nsomebody is probably a year—usually six to nine months—which is why it\r\nwas interesting for me to work for the SCL Group. When I had worked on\r\npolitical campaigns before, I looked for a new job every six to nine\r\nmonths. There are periods of time when there is no work to do, so it is\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nvery unstable and it is not something that you can usually do\r\nprofessionally. The SCL Group seemed like a good option because there\r\nwould constantly be work all around the world and hopefully no gaps, as\r\nlong as I could do my job and find political projects to work on.\r\n\r\nQ1731 Chair: With a project like the Nigeria project, where is the work being\r\ndone? Where are you based and where are they based? In terms of your\r\nwork, how much of it is done remotely? Is it all done remotely? How\r\nmuch is done in-country?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I had meetings with these individuals in London, Madrid\r\nand Washington DC, then the contract was signed. The only other meeting\r\nthat I undertook on behalf of that campaign was seeing those other\r\nconsultants when I came back to London. There were no other meetings\r\nthat I engaged with on behalf of that campaign. That was run by the\r\noperations team.\r\n\r\nQ1732 Chair: So you're based remotely while it is going on. You are effectively\r\nresponsible for putting the team together, but you are not in-country.\r\nThey are then left to get on with the campaign.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, it was suggested that, in case I wanted to go, I\r\ncould get a visa for Nigeria to go with the team, but Alexander said that\r\nthere were so many other opportunities that I could explore that I should\r\nspend my time winning a new contract while that campaign was run\r\nseparately from myself.\r\n\r\nQ1733 Chair: There are a couple of things I want to round up on before we\r\nclose. You mentioned Breitbart in your written testimony. You posed the\r\nquestion about whether Breitbart UK data could have been used in the\r\nreferendum campaign, because Breitbart data in America was being used\r\nas part of the data sets that SCL and Cambridge Analytica used in\r\nAmerica. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That's correct. Part of my sales pitch to Republican\r\nclients was that we were the sole redistributors of Breitbart's engagement\r\ndata—all the data that they collected as an online media agency. I just\r\nposed the question, because I know that there are issues around using\r\nmedia data for political purposes. It might be interesting for people to\r\nexplore that.\r\n\r\nQ1734 Chair: It is certainly an interesting point. I think we would be interested\r\nin following up on that. You said right at the beginning that you had done\r\npolitical work in Mexico. Is that right? Are you still engaged in any\r\npolitical work in Mexico?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, we're not.\r\n\r\nQ1735 Chair: Going back to what we discussed earlier about the data collected\r\nthrough Pig.gi, presumably that could be used in political campaigns as\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It could have been, but it never was.\r\n\r\nQ1736 Chair: But it could be in the future. Would there be a restriction on that?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I don't think that users have opted-in for their data to\r\nbe used for those political purposes. They would need to sign new terms\r\nand conditions upon using the app.\r\n\r\nQ1737 Chair: Okay, but that would still apply. Could you confirm for the record,\r\nyou mentioned a former housemate friend of yours who was involved in\r\nBueno Capital and Mowisat, and had been at Cambridge Analytica—who\r\nwas that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: There was no one who was also at Cambridge Analytica,\r\nbut Vlatko Gigov was part of Mowisat and Bueno Capital, and also Chase\r\nErgen—both—but neither of them were ever employed by Cambridge\r\nAnalytica.\r\n\r\nQ1738 Chair: Okay, but that was the person you were referring to.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, they are my co-founders of Bueno Capital, and they\r\nboth worked for Mowisat.\r\n\r\nQ1739 Chair: You have alleged in your testimony today, going back to the\r\nreferendum campaign, that you believe that Leave.EU as an organisation\r\nand Arron Banks as well may have broken data protection law on two\r\ngrounds: the processing of data outside of the UK, and the merging of\r\nconsumer data with political data to form the data set for the\r\nreferendum.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Or political data from the party with political data from\r\nthe campaign. If individuals had not opted in to that being a use case of\r\ntheir data, then I do not believe that those data sets could have been\r\nmatched and modelled in that way, or at least not used for\r\ncommunications purposes of a political nature.\r\n\r\nQ1740 Chair: When did you personally become aware that working in that way\r\nwould be illegal?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It would be illegal if the proper opt-in was not\r\nundertaken. With a lot of our clients, if they wanted to use certain data\r\nsets, we ran opt-in campaigns. It is very possible to make these data sets\r\nusable for matching and modelling. That is something that can easily be\r\ndone with a little bit of money.\r\n\r\nQ1741 Chair: Was that part of your recommendation?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: It would have been, of course. This has no full\r\nstrategy—this is an initial document, because we had not been paid for the\r\nfirst proposal that I had done, so I did not want to put too much energy\r\ninto exploring this if Arron banks was not planning on signing a contract,\r\nor paying for even phase 1.\r\n\r\nQ1742 Chair: But is this discussed in the legal opinion that you supplied the\r\nCommittee with?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, because the legal opinion was only for the UK\r\nIndependence party data. We would have had to have a new legal opinion\r\nbefore undertaking this piece of work.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ1743 Chair: But some of the same principles would apply. I was just\r\nwondering about how upfront people were. You have made quite a\r\nserious allegation. I am sure that that will be of interest not only to our\r\nCommittee but to the Information Commissioner and the Electoral\r\nCommission as well. I am interested in to what extent people knew at the\r\ntime that they were walking into a legal minefield, and that a lot of this\r\ndata might not be usable without consent, or whether, as you suggest in\r\nyour written submission, Arron Banks thought that it was all his data and\r\ntherefore he could do with it what he wanted.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I wasn't fully aware of all the different implications of\r\nthis at the time, or I probably would have said something about the fact\r\nthat everybody in the call centre had told me that they were using the\r\ndata of clients or prospects of Eldon Insurance. I was not completely\r\naware of ownership and opt-in. Obviously the longer I spent with\r\nCambridge Analytica and the more allegations came out about the\r\ncompany in the press, I became very well briefed in what these laws look\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nQ1744 Chair: Sure, but as part of you presenting your strategy and doing the\r\nwork that you have done, I think you have been quite clear that, as far as\r\nyou are concerned, you were working on the campaign but just not being\r\npaid for it. I think you are pretty clear on that.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: indicated assent.\r\n\r\nQ1745 Chair: As part of that, did you have discussions with them where you\r\nsaid, \"This strategy is contingent on you having the consents you need in\r\norder to use the data in this way-otherwise you are breaking the law\"?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes. In more than one of these proposals, in the\r\ndifferent points that I lay out-you can look through them in your own\r\ntime-it says that undertaking the work, or taking receipt of any data sets,\r\nwas contingent on having a specific legal opinion drawn out about the\r\nwork proposed in the document.\r\n\r\nQ1746 Chair: So your view would be that if they did not do that, then that is\r\ntheir call, but they were warned that they should.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Not only were they warned, but in the opinion by Philip\r\nCoppel, QC there were quite a few pieces of advice that said that\r\nsomething like this would at least have to have been undertaken in the\r\nUnited Kingdom only, with no data moved to another country at minimum.\r\nOpt-in structures and the Data Protection Act were mentioned as well.\r\n\r\nQ1747 Paul Farrelly: I've just got one more question, because Christopher\r\nWylie made his position quite clear. Ms Kaiser, do you hold any personal\r\nopinions on whether it is a good thing or a bad thing for the UK to leave\r\nthe European Union?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, I don't. I am not a voter here. I do believe in a lot of\r\nthe democratic structures that have been set up by the European Union. I\r\nbelieve in their human rights decisions and their upholding of individual\r\nrights and freedoms, so I think that the UK's support of that is critical to\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nthe European Union continuing to uphold that in other countries, but I also\r\nhave lived and worked all over the world, and I understand that leaving\r\nMalaysia was the best thing that ever happened to Singapore, so I can see\r\nit on both sides.\r\n\r\nPaul Farrelly: I was just curious, because of your impetus to get involved\r\nin the politics of Obama, and the company that you kept at Cambridge\r\nAnalytica for three years. Thank you.\r\n\r\nQ1748 Christian Matheson: Sophie Schmidt worked for Cambridge Analytica at\r\none point, did she not?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes I believe she did an internship in 2010.\r\n\r\nQ1749 Christian Matheson: That was before you got there?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes it was before I got there.\r\n\r\nQ1750 Christian Matheson: Obviously she has strong connections to Uber and\r\nto Google. When you were there, did you have any other contacts with\r\nsome of these big data companies such as Google or Uber?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Not Uber, although I was informed about that meeting\r\nhappening in California a couple of years ago with their CTO. But with\r\nMicrosoft, Google and a few other companies of that nature, and\r\nFacebook, they had two different political teams in the United States—so\r\nthey had their Republican team and their Democrat team, who usually\r\ninhabited separate offices on separate floors. My consultants in\r\nWashington DC would work closely with the Republican team on how we\r\nwould use their tools to the best benefit for our clients.\r\n\r\nQ1751 Christian Matheson: But it was a business relationship rather than a\r\nnexus of people at the top of the tech sector.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, they had nothing to do with executives or key\r\ndecision makers. It was a service that those technology companies provide\r\nto clients, and Cambridge Analytica was a client because we were making\r\npurchases of digital advertising space through them.\r\n\r\nChristian Matheson: Thank you.\r\n\r\nQ1752 Chair: Last couple of questions. Going back to Sam Patten: SCL brought\r\nhim in to work on election campaigns. Can you name any other\r\ncampaigns on which he worked?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: He was brought in to work on Mexico, but in the end\r\nthat campaign was not signed off or paid for, so he came back. I do not\r\nbelieve he undertook much work there at all.\r\n\r\nQ1753 Chair: And what about in America?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: In America, yes. I am trying to remember what he did\r\nfor us in Washington DC. Maybe he was a consultant for Senator Cruz's\r\ncampaign. I was copied into something where he was organising an event\r\nor a protest on Capitol Hill. I do not remember what that was for. I think it\r\nwas in opposition to sanctions against Iran being dropped. Senator Cruz\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nand Donald Trump did a joint event on the Hill, I do not know if that was\r\nthe same event that Sam was consulting to. I will have to look that up for\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nChair: But you think that could have been it.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Possibly, yes.\r\n\r\nQ1754 Chair: Going back to Mexico, did he work on some of the Caribbean\r\nelections as well?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Again that is possible. I knew that Sam was a trusted\r\nsenior consultant to the company when I joined in 2014, which is why it\r\nwas suggested that he was somebody I should work with and consider\r\ngiving a job to.\r\n\r\nQ1755 Chair: Did he work with SCL in Trinidad?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Possibly, but I think the Trinidad campaign happened\r\nbefore I even worked in the company.\r\n\r\nQ1756 Chair: And St Kitt's. You were involved in the St Kitt's campaign?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I wasn't, no.\r\n\r\nQ1757 Chair: Okay. And you are not aware whether he worked on that?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: St Kitt's: Alexander was the campaign manager himself,\r\nI think, at the time, just because the company was very small and did not\r\nhave very many consultants. He spent a lot of time there as an individual.\r\n\r\nChair: Thank you very much. Final question.\r\n\r\nQ1758 Julian Knight: Sorry, I have been coming in and out of the session. The\r\nway you have handled the questions has been very impressive. I want to\r\nget your perspective as well. What do you think legislation should do to\r\nbetter protect people's data and to empower consumers? Obviously you\r\nhave been at the sharp end of this. What do you think about what should\r\nhappen?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I'm very glad that you asked that. That has been the\r\nmain thing that I have been spending my time on since it became obvious\r\nthat even the current legislation is not sufficient to protect an individual's\r\ndata. Right now, even in the European Union, where your personal data\r\ncan be seen as property, there is not a transparent structure for you to\r\nunderstand what data has been collected about you, where it exists, and\r\nwhat these data sets look like and who they are shared with or for what\r\npurposes those data are used. That is number one—absolutely no\r\npermission-based structure to that whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThere is not a very easy way to understand the portability of your data\r\neither at the moment. So, the right to delete—you can spend a lot of\r\nmoney with lawyers and get Google to delete some things that could be\r\ndefamatory, but that is very difficult and you would have to have a lot of\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nmoney to undertake a process like that. So portability of data is incredibly\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\nThen the ability to monetise your own data for yourself. Think about it\r\nright now. The largest companies in the world, Google, at $700 billion,\r\nFacebook, at I think now $400 billion, after its engagements with\r\nCambridge and others—it used to be $500 billion—and then Amazon and\r\nAlphabet and Apple: these are the five most powerful companies in the\r\nworld, with trillions and trillions of dollars. The sole worth of their\r\ncompanies is the fact that they own and possess and hold and use the\r\npersonal data of people from all around the world. That is what their\r\npower is; those are their assets. Their assets are other people's digital\r\nassets.\r\n\r\nI personally believe, and I am backed up by a lot of my co-founders at a\r\nlobbying organisation I started called the Digital Asset Trade Association,\r\nDATA, which we founded in January—we are specifically campaigning for\r\nnew legislation on how people can have rights and access to their own\r\ndigital assets and how those are governed—that the best way to move\r\nforward is for people to possess their data like their property. If you think\r\nabout it, Airbnb has allowed you to monetise your own property, but\r\nbefore somebody comes to stay in your house, you know what your\r\nproperty's going to be used for, what their intentions are for it. You agree\r\na price and that's paid before you hand away the keys. Why can't our data\r\nassets be the same?\r\n\r\nNot only would that allow individuals to decide if they wanted to—or not—\r\nshare their data for different purposes. You might want to monetise it for\r\nadvertising, or you might want to allow politicians access to your data to\r\nunderstand more about their issues and see the campaign communications\r\nmaterials, or you might want to monetise your medical data for cancer\r\nresearch. You could be given all of these decisions and decide whether or\r\nnot you wanted to engage in that. Also, the world could be provided with a\r\nuniversal basic income. It's not a lot of money, but if you think about the\r\ntrillions of dollars that are now possessed by technology giants and by\r\nGovernments, if some of that was redistributed among individuals as\r\ncompensation for the use of their property, we would really be taking\r\nsteps in the right direction.\r\n\r\nJulian Knight: Thank you.\r\n\r\nQ1759 Chair: Are you still in touch with Alexander Nix?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: No, I'm not. It's unfortunate, because he was a friend of\r\nmine and a mentor to me for many years. I hope he has learned a lot\r\nthrough this and eventually finds a way to make amends for what has\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nQ1760 Chair: You've seen from some of the evidence we published from Emma\r\nBriant yesterday as well, it touches on his relationship with WikiLeaks, or\r\nwhether he had a relationship with WikiLeaks and whether he had a\r\ndirect relationship with Julian Assange or just through intermediaries. Do\r\nyou have any sense on that at all?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I found out about it from the press that he had reached\r\nout to, I guess, a random email that he found on their website to ask if he\r\ncould disseminate the materials that they had on Hillary Clinton, which I\r\nfound rather shocking. It's a weird cold email to send.\r\n\r\nQ1761 Chair: When he gave evidence to the Committee, he said it was via a\r\nspeaker bureau, where he knew—\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yeah, someone who takes speaking inquiries for the\r\nWikiLeaks organisation.\r\n\r\nQ1762 Chair: Nigel Oakes, in his evidence—or what Emma Briant has given us\r\nas evidence in terms of the interview she had with him—he says Nix just\r\ncalled Assange up and asked whether they could help disseminate some\r\nof the information on Hillary Clinton that WikiLeaks had. This suggests a\r\nslightly more direct route of contact. I don't know how you phone Julian\r\nAssange.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was going to say, I don't think it's possible to phone.\r\n\r\nQ1763 Chair: I know how to email him, because he's emailed us through his\r\nintermediaries, but I don't know how easy that is. It just suggests a more\r\ndirect relationship than the slightly more round-the-houses one that was\r\ndescribed by Mr Nix himself.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: From what I understand, he made this cold approach\r\nthrough an email and he received a response that there was no interest. I\r\ndon't think you can call up Julian Assange, so that was probably\r\nmisleading in the evidence.\r\n\r\nQ1764 Chair: You could stand outside the embassy and shout up to him maybe.\r\nIn your working career, have you had much engagement with WikiLeaks\r\nand Julian Assange at all, through his representatives? Has that formed\r\npart of your work at any time?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I have undertaken quite a few degrees, theses and\r\nresearch in human rights. When the Iraq war files were first released, I\r\ntaught myself how to use an FTP client so that I could read those\r\ndocuments and use them as primary resource materials. A lot of my\r\ntheses in the past have, in my biography, WikiLeaks documents as\r\ndocumentary evidence of the crimes against humanity that I was\r\nresearching.\r\n\r\nQ1765 Chair: As part of your academic research, did you try to reach out to\r\nWikiLeaks directly and talk to people about their work?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes, we had some mutual friends. I believe that John\r\nJones, Qc has been talked about in the press, and my relationship with\r\nhim. He was one of the WikiLeaks legal team.\r\n\r\nQ1766 Chair: I don't want to intrude if this is a private matter, but what was the\r\nnature of your relationship with John Jones?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: I was a consultant to Doughty Street International,\r\nwhich is a chambers that I respect very much.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChair: Just as well.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: He was starting a new section of Doughty Street in The\r\nHague, so I went there to interview for a position and he wanted to take\r\nme on. I am not a qualified barrister, although I had intended to\r\nundertake those qualifications. He had a private consultancy called Day\r\nJones, which he said he could employ me through so that I could help him\r\nwith research, casework, and campaigning. I brought a few human rights\r\ncases of individuals who were prisoners of conscience in jails around the\r\nworld, to see whether he and the team at Doughty Street could help these\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nQ1767 Chair: Was Alexander Nix aware of this work when he hired you?\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes. I had introduced him to John Jones.\r\n\r\nQ1768 Chair: If Alexander Nix wanted to reach out to Julian Assange, couldn't\r\nhe do it through you?\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: That's what I was wondering when I found that out from\r\nthe press—he could have asked me to put him in touch with the legal\r\nteam. But he didn't.\r\n\r\nQ1769 Chair: It is interesting because he says: \"They had no way of knowing\r\nhow they could get in touch with Julian Assange\", but actually he knew\r\nthat you knew, and that you worked for him, and he knew that when he\r\nhired you.\r\n\r\nBrittany Kaiser: Yes. That is why I was confused when I found that out\r\nfrom the press. Maybe he didn't want people to know that he was making\r\nthose types of approaches, which I suppose would be intelligent.\r\n\r\nChair: I think that concludes the questions from us today. Thank you very\r\nmuch. We understand what it takes to go through this process, and you\r\nhave put together a lot of information that is hugely helpful to the\r\nCommittee's work, and you have been able to talk at great length and in\r\ngreat detail about that. We are very grateful.\r\n\r\nJust before we close the session, I have to make a short announcement\r\nabout Alexander Nix. Alexander Nix was due to give evidence to the\r\nCommittee tomorrow, but his legal representation has said that he is now\r\nnot able to do that as a consequence of him having been served with an\r\ninformation notice and being subject to the criminal investigation by the\r\nInformation Commissioner's Office. We have taken advice as a Committee\r\nfrom the parliamentary authorities on this matter. He has not been\r\ncharged with any offence and the sub judice rules do not apply in this case\r\nand there is no ongoing legal proceeding. We will discuss this with the\r\nInformation Commissioner on Thursday, but it is certainly the intention of\r\nthe Committee to take this matter further and consider issuing a summons\r\nfor Mr Nix to appear on a named day some point in the near future. I hope\r\nwe will be able to update people about that early next week. Thank you\r\nvery much.",

Lucas; Christian\r\nMatheson; Brendan O'Hara; Rebecca Pow; Jo Stevens; Giles Watling.\r\n\r\nQuestions 2501-2616\r\n\r\nWitness\r\n\r\nI: Chris Vickery, Director, Cyber Risk Research, UpGuard\r\n\r\nExamination of witness\r\n\r\nWitness: Chris Vickery\r\n\r\nQ2501 Chair: Good afternoon. I would like to welcome Chris Vickery to this\r\nfurther evidence session of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select\r\nCommittee in our inquiry into disinformation and fake news. We are\r\ndelighted that you have been able to join us, Chris, and you have come\r\nall the way from the west coast to be here in London today. We have\r\nbeen following a lot of the work you have done during our inquiry. It has\r\nbeen a great benefit to us and I know to other Parliaments around the\r\nworld who are following similar issues. It is great to have a chance to\r\ndiscuss this with you today.\r\n\r\nI thought maybe for the benefit of the record and the Committee you\r\ncould explain a little bit about the nature of your work and how you got\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Currently I am the Director of Cyber Risk Research for a\r\ncompany named UpGuard. UpGuard is in the business of managing cyber\r\nrisk more than just being a simple cybersecurity company. It is a holistic\r\napproach to understanding what is in your environment, how it is\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nconfigured, how your configuration relates to third-party vendors and\r\nhow their configuration relates to known data breaches and security\r\nissues. It is an \"encompassing view\" type of business.\r\n\r\nHow I got into it was that I was training to be a paralegal at a law firm in\r\nAustin, Texas. I had my foot in the door as a runner and I was going to\r\nschool to be a paralegal. There was an opening in the tech department. I\r\nsaid to them, \"I have always been tech-savvy. Why don't I take a shot at\r\nit?\" I did that for a few years and started finding data breaches for clients\r\nof the law firm. I got involved in finding data breaches outside of work,\r\njust for fun, as a hobby. I started finding bigger and bigger ones and got\r\nmore and more attention in the media. I started finding millions of people\r\nin data breaches involving social security numbers, drivers' licences and\r\ninsurance information. There were plenty of Government-related ones.\r\nThen I started getting offers to do it professionally and I have been doing\r\nit ever since, first for one company and now with UpGuard as of April of\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nQ2502 Chair: Your role is really advising your clients on how to protect their\r\ndata online, to make it less vulnerable to data breaches. Would that be\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes, that is definitely an aspect of it.\r\n\r\nQ2503 Chair: When you are finding evidence of data breaches, are you looking\r\nat systems that companies have and looking at their vulnerabilities or\r\nfinding data that has perhaps been taken and stored in another place?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Specific to my work individually, I do not look as much at\r\nvulnerabilities as finding data that is simply exposed to the public\r\ninternet. It is out there and available to everybody. Most of the time it\r\nturns out it was not supposed to be out there and available to the public\r\ninternet but I know where to look to find data that is not necessarily\r\nhidden but kind of in the shadows.\r\n\r\nQ2504 Chair: How is data exposed in this way? How is it that data ends up\r\nbeing publicly accessible or in places you would not expect it to be?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: There are a few reasons or a few causes for this type of\r\ndata exposure. Legally I would call it a data breach but it is easier to\r\nthink of it as an exposure. It can come down most of the time to people\r\ncutting corners, taking the easy way out and not wanting to put\r\nauthentication measures into absolutely everything that they code\r\nbecause it is easier to simply make it available to everybody. If it is\r\navailable to the world, all of your other scripts are going to be able to\r\nconnect to it. You just hope that nobody finds it who you did not intend to\r\nfind it. That happens a lot more often than people realise. It is to the\r\nlevel of an epidemic, I would say. There is so much data out there on\r\nwhich people have just not bothered to batten down the hatches.\r\n\r\nQ2505 Chair: Perhaps you could give us an idea. When you say \"find this data\",\r\nwhere is it to be found? What level of sophistication would you need to be\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nable to find this information? Would anyone with a basic level of\r\ncomputer coding and training be able to do it?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: You do not need to build a code at all whatsoever. You\r\ncan use a web browser to find the vast majority of what I come across.\r\nYou just need to spend some time reading about a protocol or a type of\r\nstorage system. It does not involve special advanced anything. You just\r\nhave to be lucky about where you click and know how to ingest a large\r\namount of potentials and you will come across the gems.\r\n\r\nQ2506 Chair: Within this information you are finding datasets, passwords and\r\nusernames that could then give access to further sets of data and\r\ninformation. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes, definitely. I do not take advantage of or use the\r\npasswords that I come across, but if I were a malicious actor I could\r\ndefinitely go to the next level and use those passwords to gain access to\r\nall sorts of advanced systems further down the line.\r\n\r\nQ2507 Chair: As you say, if you can find this information then other people can\r\nfind it too.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes. No question about that.\r\n\r\nQ2508 Chair: We should cover, for the record, the legality of the work you do. If\r\nthis is openly available, is it totally accessible and able to be used by\r\nanyone who discovers it, apart from the using of private passwords and\r\nusernames?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: That is my contention, yes. It is not 100% figured out in\r\nAmerican law. I know that we are in a different territory here but I\r\nbelieve the work that I do is completely within the confines of the law.\r\n\r\nQ2509 Giles Watling: You say that you fell into it. It was almost an accidental\r\nthing; you found the data and you followed more and more. Are there\r\narmies of people like you doing this? Clearly this data can be easily\r\naccessed. As you say, you do not need to know how to code a computer\r\nor whatever. Are there armies of people out there doing this?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Figuratively and literally, yes. There are nation-state\r\narmy-type groups doing this, as well as plenty of hobbyists and\r\nprofessionals doing it.\r\n\r\nQ2510 Giles Watling: As you say, the data you harvest is open. Does it have\r\ncommercial value? Can you harvest it, package it up and sell it in\r\ndifferent ways? With statistics, you can get data and use it to back up\r\nany political point of view.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: If I were less scrupulous I could gather this data, turn\r\naround and sell it for a massive profit, yes.\r\n\r\nQ2511 Giles Watling: You once said that cryptocurrencies are an inevitability.\r\nWe know that they are sometimes used by bad actors in nefarious ways.\r\nHow can we regulate that? How do you see that being regulated?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: That is a very difficult question. I do not believe there is\r\na good understanding in general, by the people that would be enacting\r\nthe regulations, of what a cryptocurrency is or can be, and I do not think\r\nwe have advanced far enough in blockchain technology to understand\r\nwhat it is we need to understand. I do not know of a good way to\r\nregulate it. It is definitely something that needs to happen. There needs\r\nto be some regulation and some control and there are some anti-money\r\nlaundering issues that need to be worked out, but I do not have a\r\nsolution right now. I do not have a financial background; I am more on\r\nthe cybersecurity side of things. However, if the right minds come\r\ntogether I think it can be done.\r\n\r\nQ2512 Giles Watling: What makes you think that they are going to be an\r\ninevitability? Forgive me, I do not understand that.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I believe the specific tweet you are talking about had to\r\ndo with the idea of bounties being put out. Was that the concept?\r\n\r\nGiles Watling: Yes.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: What I meant as an inevitability was the bounty aspect of\r\nit, not necessarily the cryptocurrency aspect of it. What I was tweeting\r\nabout was my personal opinion that somewhere down the line somebody\r\nis going to figure out that, \"I can put up a token sale or cryptocurrency\r\noffering and get people to buy into it and have it done in an anonymous\r\nway\". A smart contract can be created that pays out somebody when a\r\nfact changes. Smart contracts are all about verifying data and a human\r\ndoes not have to interact to get the contract finished. It is a computer\r\nalgorithm, basically. If you did that based on whether or not somebody is\r\ndeceased or living, you could very simply anonymously have a hit put out\r\non somebody. That is what I believe is the inevitability. Somebody will\r\nfigure that out, put all the tools together, and that type of thing will\r\nbecome a reality.\r\n\r\nQ2513 Giles Watling: You feel that we need to move in and start regulating?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: We need to figure out a way to prevent that type of\r\nreality from happening. I do not know the best way to do it. If it is\r\nregulation, which is probably the easiest way to do it, we need to get\r\nsome controls in place.\r\n\r\nQ2514 Christian Matheson: Mr Vickery, good afternoon. I want to follow on\r\nfrom Mr Watling's questions. You have painted a picture of the business\r\nthat you are in. I am guessing a business will come to you and say,\r\n\"Chris, we need you to check and see if our data is secure or if any of our\r\ndata is publicly available that should not be\". Is that right? Will they come\r\nto you and ask that?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: One of the platform offerings that UpGuard has is known\r\nas BreachSight. That is essentially a concept of us shepherding an\r\nenterprise-level company's web assets, keeping an eye out, seeing if they\r\nhave any easily publicly exposed data or not so easily publicly exposed\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\ndata, letting them know and giving them the heads-up so that they can\r\nget secure. That is part of what we do.\r\n\r\nQ2515 Christian Matheson: You also talked about this being a hobby for you.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It was a hobby before I started doing it professionally,\r\nyes.\r\n\r\nQ2516 Christian Matheson: What drew you to the SCL, Cambridge Analytica,\r\nAggregateIQ network of companies?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: That was a situation where it was about 9.30 pm\r\nCalifornia time, around 20 March, I believe. I have a TV that sits on the\r\nwall behind me in my home office and I was listening to a news show.\r\nThey had mentioned SCL. I did not know who AggregateIQ was. I was\r\nprompted in my regular searches through the internet to look and see if\r\nSCL had any open source code. There is a website called GitHub where\r\ndevelopers can put open source code and collaborate. A lot of big\r\ncompanies do contribute open source code to the public realm and I was\r\ncurious if SCL had, because that gives you a view into their processes\r\nand various techniques sometimes. They were being talked about in the\r\nnews. I was at my computer, I was on GitHub, so I figured, \"Hey, why\r\nthe heck not? Just take a look at it\".\r\n\r\nWhen I searched for SCL Group there was a result for a repository\r\napparently owned by a person named Ali Yassine, who worked for or\r\nmaybe still works for SCL. Within that there was a reference in his open\r\nsource code repository to ab.aggregateiq.com, in one of the comments. I\r\nhad never heard of it. I went to the website and I was met with the\r\nphrase \"peer data intelligence\". It seemed to me when I scrolled further\r\ndown that they did voter intelligence, voter canvassing, matching up data\r\nto donors and everything. It seemed weird to me that SCL and this group\r\nwould be working in the same kind of area. Cambridge Analytica is\r\nbasically part of SCL. Why would another company be doubling up\r\nefforts? That is what it seemed to me, just in my very initial\r\nunderstanding of what they were doing.\r\n\r\nIt did not make sense to me so I started looking into the company a little\r\nbit more, enumerated their subdomains, and I saw that one of the\r\nsubdomains was gitlab.aggregateiq.com. I went to it. I knew what GitLab\r\nwas, but then I noticed the registration page was active. It had never\r\nbeen turned off. They were, in essence, inviting the world to join their\r\nGitLab repository.\r\n\r\nQ2517 Christian Matheson: Sorry to interrupt. Is this the same night that you\r\nsaw it on TV?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes, this is the same night.\r\n\r\nQ2518 Christian Matheson: This is quite a quick process?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I tend to spend a large amount of time on my computer\r\nso I accomplish a lot of tasks in one sitting, very much to my wife's\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\ndismay. Yes, this was in the same night, definitely. It was within a half-\r\nhour of me running the search.\r\n\r\nChristian Matheson: Sorry, I interrupted your flow. Carry on, please.\r\nChris Vickery: Was I explaining in too much detail?\r\n\r\nChristian Matheson: No, it was great.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: They were inviting the public to register on their GitLab\r\nrepository. It occurred to me that this may be a misconfiguration, or\r\nmaybe they really are collaborating with the world on developing the\r\nsoftware that is inside of here. I did not know what software was inside of\r\nthere or if any software was inside of there. I created an account, logged\r\nin, and it hit me that, \"Oh my God, this is the repository of the tools that\r\nAggregateIQ and, it looks like, Cambridge Analytica and SCL are using.\r\nThis is the source code behind these scripts\". I immediately understood\r\nthe gravity of the situation and thought, \"I need to document this and\r\ndownload what is here because a lot of people are going to be very\r\ninterested in seeing this\".\r\n\r\nQ2519 Christian Matheson: It was the underlying programme as opposed to\r\nany data storage itself?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: The line there is a little fuzzy, but yes. The best way to\r\nunderstand it, the way I have been explaining it to people who have been\r\nasking, is that in a kitchen you have the cooking pot and the utensils, the\r\nspoon, the ladle and all that stuff. Then in the refrigerator you have the\r\nmeat, potatoes and all of the foodstuffs. When the whole process is going\r\nyou pull out the stuff from the refrigerator, you pull out the utensils, you\r\nmix it all together and the magic happens. I found the cooking pot, the\r\nladle and all that, and the codes to enter the refrigerator. I did not\r\nactually enter the refrigerator and get out the raw data. I could have. It\r\nis my contention that if I were a malicious actor I could have got into\r\neverything that AggregateIQ has their hands in.\r\n\r\nQ2520 Christian Matheson: You make it sound, for somebody like you who\r\nknows what they are doing, quite simple and quite easy. Were you\r\nsurprised at how straightforward it was?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I have been doing this so long that I have seen a lot of\r\ncrazy stuff. As far as surprise goes, I am not necessarily surprised. I am\r\nimpressed by the gravity of the situation and the scope of what was\r\nthere. It is not a common find but it is not out of the realm of possibility\r\nthat somebody involved in so much would make a mistake along the way\r\nand have a little chink in their armour, or whatever you want to think of it\r\nas. I am sorry, did I answer your question fully there?\r\n\r\nQ2521 Christian Matheson: Yes. If I think about the online communities you\r\nare talking about that will work with this open source code, do some of\r\nthem ever come with discussion boards where they discuss things like\r\nthis? If so, has there been any chatter on any of these about what you\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nhave found?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Do you have a specific chat board or forum in mind?\r\n\r\nChristian Matheson: No. Forgive me, I know nothing about this\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: There has been mention, definitely, on plenty of sites.\r\nThere are more socially angled sites like Reddit. There are sites like\r\nGitHub. I was explaining GitHub. It does not really have a forum for\r\npeople to congregate and talk about this stuff. It is more like there is a\r\nproject and people can comment within the project's commenting page in\r\nvarious ways. These days there is not so much an open message board\r\ncommunity somewhere where people talk about specific projects like this.\r\nThere are so many of them, they are so spread out and they are so\r\nvaried it is not easy to answer that question in that way.\r\n\r\nQ2522 Rebecca Pow: I am very interested in the fridge. Why did you not go\r\nand find out what was in the fridge and what did you suspect was in the\r\nfridge?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I believe that accessing the fridge or the raw databases\r\nholding the information would have put myself and potentially my\r\nemployer in legal danger. I avoid using passwords and usernames when I\r\ngo looking for data because I do not want to be prosecuted, although it is\r\nstill questionable what level of going into it would be a criminal offence in\r\nAmerica. We have the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and it is extremely\r\nvague. They never define what unauthenticated or authenticated access\r\nis. It is up to the prosecutor's determination. I do not want to get so\r\nclose to that edge that a prosecutor could determine that I have\r\ncommitted a criminal act. That is why I do not.\r\n\r\nQ2523 Rebecca Pow: You suggested that for people like yourself it was easy to\r\nfind this way into the fridge. Why do you think that was? Do you think\r\nthat was on purpose?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I have been finding large voter databases since\r\nDecember 2015, about one to two a year, and I have had that same\r\nquestion every single time I have come across one of them. People ask\r\nme, \"Do you think that people were co-ordinating by leaving this open on\r\npurpose?\" The answer I have come to to that question, which I believe is\r\nthe same question you are asking here, is that I cannot say one way or\r\nthe other. It would be a smart way to do it. If you wanted to collaborate\r\nwith somebody but have plausible deniability, this would be a good way\r\nto do it. You can say, \"Oh my God, it was open to everybody. I can't\r\nbelieve I made that mistake\", while under the table you are grinning,\r\nnodding and saying, \"I got away with it\". That is definitely a possibility. I\r\ncannot say that is why this happened, I cannot say that is why any of the\r\nlarge databases that I find have been exposed, but it is a possibility.\r\n\r\nQ2524 Rebecca Pow: There was no protection on it? They did not protect it?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: None. Not at all. Anybody in the entire world with an\r\ninternet connection could have got into everything.\r\n\r\nQ2525 Chair: Why do you think this information was left in such an exposed\r\nstate?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I believe the most likely explanation is that when the\r\ndevelopers or staff members, whoever worked for AggregateIQ, were\r\ninteracting with GitLab, the repository and all the code and scripts, they\r\nwere likely accessing it through other tools accessing the GitLab server.\r\nFor example there is GitKraken, which allows you to have a good\r\ngraphical user interface on the desktop but plugs into a Git server. The\r\nGit server has to exist. They probably could have turned off the webpage\r\nserving the registration of the login page and still been able to access the\r\nGit server; they just never turned it off. They were using third-party\r\ntools, never going to that login page and noticing that the registration\r\nlink was active. That is why I believe they had the oversight of leaving\r\nthat up.\r\n\r\nQ2526 Chair: Would the consequence of them working in this way, if it was a\r\nmistake that the data was left there, be to allow anyone working at AIQ,\r\nSCL or Cambridge Analytica to effectively access, using your analogy, the\r\nsame tools and the same fridge?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: There is no limitation on who could have accessed it:\r\nanyone in the entire world; anyone in any country who has an internet\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nQ2527 Chair: Certainly within those companies it would facilitate a completely\r\nopen way of working all the time. I suppose you also have to know it is\r\nthere. You found it by chance.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I followed a trail to it.\r\n\r\nQ2528 Chair: Yes, but there are other people who would know it was there and\r\ncould easily access it because they knew it was there. Do you think there\r\nwas a particular virtue for them in making it so easily available?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I really do not know their intention behind it. It would\r\njust be speculation on my part to guess at why they did it. It would be\r\none thing if I had comments within the GitLab repository saying, \"We are\r\nleaving this open for x, y and z\", but I have not come across anything\r\nthat said why they left it open. I do not want to guess and put any\r\nthoughts into anybody's head about why.\r\n\r\nQ2529 Chair: It would also be quite a convenient excuse. If someone was asked\r\nthe question, \"Did you give this data to this person?\" you could say no,\r\nbut you could have let them know where to find it.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Very much so, yes. Very easily.\r\n\r\nQ2530 Chair: We know that obviously AIQ developed the Ripon platform that\r\nwas used by SCL. Could tools like that have been connected to this\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\ndataset?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Let me clarify the SCL, Cambridge Analytica,\r\nAggregatelQ thing. I believe the flow was that Cambridge Analytica\r\npitched Ripon to Senator Ted Cruz's campaign originally and Ted Cruz's\r\ncampaign was paying for the development of Ripon when they thought\r\nRipon already existed. Cambridge Analytica had subcontracted it out to\r\nAggregateIQ without the Cruz campaign knowing. I believe that is the\r\nsituation. Cruz's campaign thought this tool existed but they were\r\nactually developing it. Cambridge Analytica was not developing it, AIQ\r\nwas. I think their relationship is a little bit closer than they admit. Ripon\r\ndoes plug into lots and lots of voter databases—it certainly does. Is that\r\nthe answer to your question?\r\n\r\nQ2531 Chair: Yes. We have had lots of conflicting evidence during this inquiry\r\nso far about the value of different datasets. Indeed, last week Aleksandr\r\nKogan said that he did not feel that the results of his surveys were of\r\nmuch value as a predictive tool. Then again, none of these datasets were\r\ndesigned to be used in isolation but to be combined with other things.\r\n\r\nIn this case, building on the analogy you have used, it strikes me that\r\nwhat people are doing is combining multiple datasets that help to create\r\na richer profile of an individual and then linking that profile to their\r\nFacebook profile, which is the mechanism by which they can be contacted\r\nand communicated with. Once you have created your different profile\r\ngroups based on the different opinions, different beliefs and different\r\nfears that people have, and created your targeting groups from that data,\r\nall you then need to know is who those people are on Facebook and\r\nwhere to find them. They are your custom audience. Then you do not\r\nneed the original datasets anymore. You have created the hybrid product\r\nthat you are going to use for your campaign. Do you believe that is what\r\nwas being done? Do you believe that is why people are saying that you\r\ncould destroy that original data or give that original data back, because\r\nyou no longer need it?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: My understanding is that saying it has no value—just to\r\nstart at the beginning of what you were asking—is a little bit deceptive.\r\nYou have this graph in front of you, I believe, talking about various\r\nsources—\r\n\r\nChair: If I could just say this for the record, Christopher has given us this\r\nchart. It has been published by the Committee and will be available on\r\nthe Committee's website as well. Go ahead.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It is important to realise that this is something I put\r\ntogether that has to do with my current understanding of a data flow, not\r\nnecessarily who has a business relationship or who is the same company\r\nas somebody else. This is just the way data is flowing. It is different from\r\nan organisational graph.\r\n\r\nThe dataset that is involved in the Deep Root Analytics box down there\r\ncost $33 million to develop, I believe. Back when I found the Deep Root\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nAnalytics bucket that had all that data in it, I looked into it. I believe it\r\nwas $30 million-plus that was paid by various campaigns and so on to\r\ndevelop that one. Anything that comes out of $33 million is not going to\r\nbe worthless. Large datasets have value. I am not saying that Deep Root\r\nAnalytics has directly given this to AggregateIQ or anybody but it is in the\r\nsame flow of data and it does have extreme value.\r\n\r\nAnother example is related to the first large voter database I found in\r\n2015. I pretended to be a potential buyer of a large database like that\r\nand I called up a company that sells these voter databases. I said, \"If I\r\nwanted to buy this, how much would it cost me?\" They quoted me\r\n$260,000 for a list of names, addresses and phone numbers for the\r\nentire United States. Just a simple list like that they were trying to sell for\r\nquarter of a million dollars. I am sorry, what was the rest of the\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\nQ2532 Chair: People are collecting these datasets. They are doing that,\r\npresumably, to create target groups out of those datasets. Let us say you\r\nare in the Ted Cruz campaign or the Trump campaign and you are saying,\r\n\"We want a dataset of people who believe there should be tighter\r\nrestrictions on guns. That is a massively motivating factor in how they\r\nare going to vote in the election. We want people who have that belief or\r\nthat view, and who live in New Hampshire. We are going to try to create\r\na database of people like that. The way in which we will communicate\r\nwith them will be using Facebook. Therefore, we need to link those\r\ndatasets to an actual person, in order to build our custom audience. Then\r\nwe could also ask Facebook to find people who are like that\".\r\n\r\nIf that is what is being done, once you have created those target groups\r\nbased on data and you have identified them—you have their email\r\naddresses, you have their Facebook profiles—the actual dataset that was\r\nused to create this hybrid set you do not particularly need anymore. Not\r\nfor that campaign, anyway.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Ted Cruz's campaign does not need it anymore. That is\r\nwhat you are saying?\r\n\r\nChair: Yes.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I was thinking for a second that you were talking about\r\nthe people who have this data that this is being pulled from. To Ted\r\nCruz's campaign, yes, all they need to know is who is the right person to\r\ntarget. They do not necessarily need the background data because the\r\nnumber crunchers and the analytics companies are dealing with all that.\r\n\r\nWith the written documentation from AggregateIQ's GitLab, they describe\r\nthis process. What is happening is this \"database of truth\" exists with all\r\nthe data, and then they pull out escrow copies—they are called escrow\r\ndatabases in their documentation—of what is being asked for and is\r\nrelevant to a certain campaign. That would be your idea of the audience\r\nof pro-gun people from New Hampshire. It would go out into an escrow\r\ncopy that would be available to Ted Cruz's campaign, or if AggregateIQ\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\ndetermines that this group of people is relevant to this campaign they\r\nwould pull out that group. Ted Cruz's campaign, or whoever's campaign,\r\ndoes not need access to the whole database of truth. They just need\r\naccess to that list of people. Yes, I believe that is an accurate depiction.\r\n\r\nQ2533 Chair: Is the database of truth—it is starting to sound a bit like a science\r\nfiction novel—a sort of constantly evolving organism that gets richer and\r\nricher depending on what is put into it? It gets, if anything, more\r\neffective?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes. That is also described in the documentation. The\r\nfoundation of the database of truth, according to what is written in there,\r\nis the Republican database called the Data Trust voter vault. There is a\r\ncompany named Data Trust that is very close to the Republican party, the\r\nGOP, in America, to the point that I would say they could be considered\r\nthe same entity. They argue differently. That is the foundation of the\r\ndatabase of truth, at least as far as American politics is related to this.\r\n\r\nThen they add state voter files to, I assume, corroborate what is in the\r\nRNC's database. Then they add consumer purchasable data such as from\r\nExperian. It is limitless what other companies would sell you, data similar\r\nto Experian. Then they add lists that the campaign itself gives to them.\r\nSenator Ted Cruz could have a list of people who have donated to his\r\ncampaign. He would then want to integrate that into it if he was looking\r\nfor people to communicate with.\r\n\r\nThen with the escrow copies that come out, there is the ability to add the\r\nchanges that are made to the escrow copy back to the database of truth\r\nif they are approved. It is not like the campaign has full access to the\r\noriginal dataset and can change things willy-nilly. No. They can make\r\nchanges to their own dataset and if it meets a bar of acceptability or\r\nwould be helpful to the original database of truth, it can be fed back into\r\nit. The different iterations are kept track of.\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, the RNC has argued in hearings in front of the FEC,\r\nthe Federal Elections Commission, in America, that the RNC's Data Trust\r\ngiving that full dataset to campaigns is not an illegal contribution or a\r\ncontribution that is of any value of all because they have agreements\r\nwhere they get data fed back to them from the campaign. If you consider\r\nthat as part of the equation, if the RNC has the same agreement with\r\nAIQ, any data that is gathered from an \"in\" campaign goes back to the\r\ndatabase of truth. It would then go back to the RNC database and\r\nenhance everything along the way. If you ask me, giving out that dataset\r\nis extremely valuable and is worth more than the in-kind contribution\r\nthat they get back, but that is up to interpretation. That whole data flow\r\nis definitely occurring.\r\n\r\nQ2534 Chair: Going back to some of the things we know about SCL and some of\r\nthe people from AIQ, the campaigns they were working on, we know that\r\nstaff from both AIQ and SCL were working on what was done for the\r\nBolton Super PAC in 2014, the mid-term races. Aleksandr Kogan's\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nresearch work was also feeding directly into that process. Dr Kogan said\r\nhe was not aware of the candidates they were working on but he was\r\naware that this data was being asked for to work on election races.\r\n\r\nDo you believe that the datasets developed for the state races that were\r\nbeing supported by Ambassador Bolton would all end up in the database\r\nof truth and that future campaigns could benefit from that acquired\r\nknowledge as well?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: The raw data itself maybe not, but it is extremely likely\r\nthe derivatives would be integrated into it. In this type of industry, data\r\ndoes not just go away. It does not just disappear. It is sticky. It gathers\r\nup. The good stuff stays. Even the bad stuff stays, but it is not used. It is\r\nheld in an archive somewhere. Nothing disappears.\r\n\r\nQ2535 Chair: Is the derivative in this case, for the Bolton work, going to be a\r\npsychological profile of somebody linked to their Facebook account? Then\r\nthey are probably also linked to other datasets about them and their\r\nelectoral roll location. That would be the derivative of those pieces of\r\nresearch?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Within Ripon there is an ability to search for people based\r\non OCEAN psychographic scoring. Yes, derivatives would have been\r\nintegrated if that is going to function at all. I do not know why that page\r\nwould be there if it does not function that way.\r\n\r\nQ2536 Chair: Was Ripon used in the Donald Trump campaign by Cambridge\r\nAnalytica?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I cannot say that it was. I think the most likely situation\r\nis that things that they learned from developing Ripon were leaned upon\r\nbut I have not come across anything that directly says, \"This was used in\r\nthe Donald Trump campaign. This was used here, there and there\". If it\r\never existed it could have been moved or deleted. I do not know if it did\r\nor not. I have no idea.\r\n\r\nQ2537 Chair: Do you think any of the derivatives from Dr Kogan's work could\r\nhave been used to support Cambridge Analytica's work for the Trump\r\ncampaign?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes, definitely. They do not need the original allegedly ill-\r\ngotten Facebook data if they have the derivative modelling, training data\r\nand everything from it. They do not need that original dataset anymore. I\r\ndo not know why they would learn it and not use it.\r\n\r\nQ2538 Chair: The same for the Cruz campaign. They did a lot of psychological\r\nprofiling of voters for Ted Cruz.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: No question about it, yes.\r\n\r\nQ2539 Chair: Alexander Nix said that was not used for the Trump campaign.\r\nDoes that add to the long list of clarifications we need from Mr Nix? You\r\nthink there is no question that would have been used?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: If I were on a jury in America taking this in, I would put\r\nforward the conclusion that yes, that is the most likely situation that\r\nmust have occurred, just about beyond the shadow of a doubt.\r\n\r\nQ2540 Chair: On that basis, psychological profiling was used to support the\r\nTrump campaign.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I would say that would be an accurate statement. People\r\nare going to argue against it but I think so.\r\n\r\nQ2541 Chair: Whether or not the Trump campaign actually commissioned it,\r\nthey benefited from previous work that had been done.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: If Cambridge Analytica was involved in the Trump\r\ncampaign, which is a yes, then yes, the Trump campaign would have\r\nbenefited from psychological profiling. Yes, I believe so.\r\n\r\nQ2542 Ian C. Lucas: Can I stick with the fridge? I find it extremely helpful. I\r\nam particularly interested in what I call \"the ingredients\"—what is\r\nactually in the fridge, which you did not explore. Is that right?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I did not use any usernames or passwords to log in to\r\nany databases that feed into this stuff.\r\n\r\nQ2543 Ian C. Lucas: If the ingredients had been put in the pot and then mixed\r\nwith the utensils, that creates the product that is very valuable. Do you\r\nknow what the ingredients were? For example, was it individual data like\r\nnames, addresses and passwords? Do you know that?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes, because the tools themselves have the field names\r\nthat feed into them and everything ready to parse out that data. On this\r\nhard drive that I am delivering to the Committee you will find all of that,\r\nthe code itself that deals with the ingredients, and you will be able to see\r\nfor yourselves the field names and everything explained, at least\r\neverything that was present on the GitLab. You will be able to determine\r\na bit of that.\r\n\r\nQ2544 Ian C. Lucas: Is any of that information Facebook data?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: What would you call Facebook data? Somebody's\r\nFacebook ID, the ability to target somebody on Facebook and things\r\nabout somebody's Facebook account but not their Facebook postings?\r\nWould that still count as Facebook data? Yes. Then that is there.\r\n\r\nQ2545 Ian C. Lucas: We know from the evidence of Mr Kogan that information\r\nwas taken from Facebook and went through GSR to Cambridge Analytica.\r\nWhat I am very interested in is the chain between Facebook, GSR and\r\nCambridge Analytica, to AIQ. Is it possible to trace the information from\r\nFacebook through to AIQ?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: You are referring specifically, I assume, to the allegedly\r\nill-gotten Facebook data?\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Yes, the data that Facebook wanted back in 2015.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I do not know if you will be able to determine definitively\r\nthat that chain of events happened, given what is on the hard drive. You\r\nwill see, though, I believe, that the derivatives—the trainings and the\r\nmodels gathering what is relevant—are what counts and what matters.\r\nThe original Facebook dataset, the raw data itself, is very\r\ninconsequential. Whether or not that flowed through here does not\r\nmatter. It is like you have a steam engine ready to go. You do not need\r\nthe prototype of the steam engine or the framework you built it on\r\nanymore. That can go back in the warehouse. You have the thing to toss\r\neverything with. You have it there to go. I cannot say one way or the\r\nother if you will be able to determine concretely that that flow happened.\r\n\r\nQ2546 Ian C. Lucas: If the data was inconsequential from Facebook, why did\r\nFacebook want it back?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It was inconsequential to the modelling once the\r\nmodelling existed. Cambridge Analytica, having that modelling, have\r\ndifferent reasons and purposes for existing from Facebook's reason for\r\nexisting. Facebook legally wants to be able to say, \"That data does not\r\nexist anymore\". For their purposes of not getting sued they want to be\r\nable to say, \"That data does not exist anymore\". They have totally\r\ndifferent purposes for existing. That would be Facebook's motivation for\r\ngetting it deleted, not to stop the data modelling, analytics and graphing\r\nthat existed from it.\r\n\r\nQ2547 Ian C. Lucas: Once the data had moved to Cambridge Analytica in 2015\r\nvia Mr Kogan, is it the case that the value of that could have been used\r\nby Cambridge Analytica in its relationship with AIQ? It seems to me that\r\nonce the value is released from Cambridge Analytica to AIQ, it is gone.\r\nYou cannot give it back unless you chase it down the chain to AIQ to get\r\nit back.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It is a little complicated. I do not believe Facebook ever\r\nclaimed that they got rid of any derivative works and modelling that\r\ncame out of the dataset. They just wanted the raw dataset gone. There\r\nwas no way for them to know what was modelled from that dataset and\r\nthey are not interested, as far as I know, in getting the modelling\r\ndestroyed or, even if they could request it get destroyed, the derivatives\r\nof it. Does that make sense?\r\n\r\nQ2548 Ian C. Lucas: Yes. When Cambridge Analytica got the data from\r\nFacebook they made the pudding. They made the dish in the pot, if we go\r\nback to the analogy, and then they passed it on.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: They made the pot to put in more dishes in the future.\r\nThey moulded it from the pudding, basically. Does that make sense?\r\nOnce they have moulded the pot they can make more pudding in the\r\nfuture with different datasets. They do not need the original pudding\r\nanymore. That was what Facebook wanted to delete, the pudding, so\r\nthey did not get sued.\r\n\r\nQ2549 Ian C. Lucas: They had a recipe?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes, essentially. That is one way to think of it.\r\n\r\nQ2550 Ian C. Lucas: They had the recipe so they could give back the\r\ningredients and make the dish on the basis of the recipe, which they then\r\npassed on to AIQ.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It appears that yes, that would be a likely scenario.\r\n\r\nQ2551 Ian C. Lucas: What also mystifies me about AIQ is that we know AIQ\r\nhad a relationship with Cambridge Analytica and we know that Cambridge\r\nAnalytica had a relationship with Leave.EU. I do not understand why AIQ\r\nthen had a commercial relationship with a different organisation, Vote\r\nLeave. Do you have any knowledge?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Of why, or the relationship?\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Do you know why that is? Do you know why Vote Leave\r\nhad a relationship with AIQ?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: The why of it, I do not know. That is something that is in\r\ntheir heads, why they became partners or whatever. What I can tell you\r\ndefinitively is that there were projects within this GitLab repository for\r\nChange Britain, Vote Leave, DUP and Veterans for Britain. All of it looked\r\nlike it had been worked on by AIQ.\r\n\r\nQ2552 Ian C. Lucas: You have presented a very interesting list that you have\r\njust referred to—DUP, Vote Leave. I know that separately and later the\r\nCountryside Alliance was also involved with AIQ.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: For legal purposes, I have to be very clear that there was\r\nnot evidence that Countryside Alliance was involved in any Brexit stuff. It\r\nwas later on.\r\n\r\nQ2553 Ian C. Lucas: Yes. I want to make that clear. I agree with that entirely.\r\nWe know that AIQ had a clear commercial relationship with Vote Leave\r\nbecause there were payments made to AIQ by Vote Leave.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: The results of those payments, the projects, are right\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nQ2554 Ian C. Lucas: Okay. We are going to have to ask other people, probably,\r\nabout that relationship in due course.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: The why.\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: The why, yes, but there is clearly a chain here, if I can\r\nmix metaphors dreadfully.\r\n\r\nQ2555 Chair: Is the information you have on that portable drive still available?\r\nIs that still on GitLab or was that removed?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: That was taken down 11 minutes after an e-mail was\r\nsent notifying AIQ that this was perhaps exposed more than it should be.\r\n\r\nQ2556 Chair: Was that sent by you? Did you notify them?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: That was sent by a journalist. Normally it would come\r\nfrom me but—and I have not delved into this in any interviews of\r\nanything because it is a legally sensitive topic—the reason I did not send\r\nit is that there were prima facie cases of potential unlawful activity going\r\non, and it seems weird for me to notify people that I suspect may be\r\ncommitting criminal acts that their criminal acts are being exposed to the\r\nworld by something that they have put out. I allowed a journalist that\r\nwas going to cover the situation to send the notification e-mail just to be\r\none step removed from that.\r\n\r\nQ2557 Chair: That is clear. Was the journalist who sent the notification a\r\njournalist whom you had notified about the existence of this data?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: The way that happened was when I originally found a\r\nlittle breadcrumb on GitHub, which is a little bit different from GitLab, the\r\npublic GitHub; I was in communication with this journalist who has\r\nbecome kind of a friend over the years. I said to him, \"There is this\r\ninteresting little thing involving SCL. I know they are in the news and\r\nmaybe it is something you want to look into\". I did not think it would lead\r\nanywhere, and then this whole rabbit hole opened up, and since he was\r\nalready aware of the first breadcrumb he was aware of the further\r\ninvestigatory issues that came up.\r\n\r\nQ2558 Chair: There are lots of cooking analogies today. The breadcrumb that\r\nyou refer to, is that just the reference to AIQ that you mentioned at the\r\nbeginning, and the other information that you were looking at with SCL\r\nwas something else?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Just ahead of that was the fact that there was this\r\napparent SCL employee, Ali Yassine, who had the GitHub repository; it\r\nwas just the existence of some SCL-related code. That was the initial,\r\ninitial part and then that led to the comment about aggregateiq.com.\r\n\r\nQ2559 Chair: I am sure you will be familiar with the testimony given by AIQ to\r\nthe Canadian House of Commons.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes, I did watch that.\r\n\r\nQ2560 Chair: They were asked about, \"Have you got data?\" to which they say,\r\n\"No\". But do you think that they may not have data but they have access\r\nto data? Do you think that is a real distinction that we should take an\r\ninterest in?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes. However, they are also not being quite fully\r\nstraightforward about having data. They may not have the large oceans\r\nbut they have the residual ponds from them accessing it, such as I was\r\nable to locate my own information in a spreadsheet called Online\r\nActivists, which had been pulled and was available to AIQ. They had my\r\nhome address from when I lived in Austin, Texas. I don't know when the\r\ndata was pulled, but I found myself in there, my own personal details.\r\n\r\nQ2561 Chair: I suppose what I was interested in is: is it a convenient excuse for\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\npeople to say, \"We don't keep datasets. We don't keep databases. We\r\ndon't hold this data\"? They continually say things like that, which may be\r\ntrue but it could be it exists in a cloud system or in a remote location that\r\nthey have easy and ready access to?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes. It is a weasel way of saying it. It is a technicality,\r\nkind of kindergarten, cross your fingers behind your back when you are\r\ngiving testimony type of answer.\r\n\r\nQ2562 Chair: Who owns these? Who do you think owns the database of truth?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: From looking at the code, different scripts on here, one of\r\nthe companies that seem to be referred to as one of the holders is WPA\r\nIntel, which is a political intelligence analysis company, one of the head\r\npeople being Chris Wilson. It may be that if you were to ask WPA, I\r\nwouldn't be surprised—and they have not been asked this as far as I\r\nknow—if they would try to give you the same answer and say, \"It is being\r\nheld somewhere else\". It brings up the idea of, okay, if something is just\r\nephemeral and existing between our organisations, each side can point\r\nsomewhere else and say, \"No, I am accessing it from there\" or, \"No, I am\r\njust accessing it from there\".\r\n\r\nWith technology these days and peer-to-peer stuff and whatever, you\r\ncould arguably make a file system that has no real owner, that is just in\r\nexistence in cyberspace, so you may run into those weasel answers, left\r\nand right, and never find somebody who will admit to having the data\r\nitself. It is purely possible.\r\n\r\nQ2563 Chair: That would support the portrait that Chris Wylie painted to the\r\nCommittee of here you have a sort of franchise model of work.\r\nEffectively, you have a group of people who work to a common interest\r\nbut they are legally separate from each other, and the dataset that they\r\nwork from is not owned by any one of them but is just held in common.\r\nThat would support that model as well.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes, and that would be a very convenient way of avoiding\r\nlots of potential problems that they might run into. Yes, that would be\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nQ2564 Chair: Why do you think the EU referendum files were uploaded to the\r\nAIQ GitLab?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: What do I think of it?\r\n\r\nChair: Why do you think they were? A lot of this data would have been\r\nbased on American elections. Was it just there for convenience because\r\nAIQ had worked on it and worked on other things too?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes. They had projects from lots of things that they had\r\nworked on. I don't see any reason why there would have been a\r\nseparation. If they have their repository of projects they worked on,\r\nthose are projects they worked on.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ2565 Chair: Yes, so it is just the deep store of all the stuff that they have\r\ndone?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ2566 Brendan O'Hara: Going back to the chink in the armour that you found\r\nand this idea that data could have been left for people to find, when you\r\nfound that, was there any way of telling if you were the first person to\r\nhave found that information or is there a way to find out who had been\r\nthere before you?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Hypothetically, there are ways that you could have\r\nlogging in place to see who accessed it but the person in control of that\r\nlogging would also be able to modify that logging, so I don't know if you\r\ncould rely on it to a forensic level but, theoretically, they could have been\r\nkeeping logs of access. I cannot say there is a disinterested third party\r\nthat would know, but logging could have been enabled.\r\n\r\nQ2567 Brendan O'Hara: That was not something that you could have found out\r\nwhen you discovered it? This idea that perhaps it had been deliberately\r\nleft there, as you said earlier on. There is no way that you could find out\r\nwho had accessed it before you?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Not unless I was willing to cross that boundary into trying\r\nto exploit the system, so there is no way that I could have—within my\r\nunderstanding of the law—come across a log of who was accessing it. I\r\ndidn't come across any sort of logging of who may have accessed it.\r\n\r\nQ2568 Brendan O'Hara: Would AIQ have been able to know who had accessed\r\nit?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Theoretically, yes. I don't know if they were keeping\r\nthose logs or not but, yes, they would have been able to. Yes, they could.\r\n\r\nQ2569 Brendan O'Hara: Could I move on to Facebook for a moment? Could\r\nyou describe the issues that you believe are still occurring between\r\nFacebook app usage and potential exploitation of data? Does it still exist?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: What do you define as exploitation? Like, mass\r\nharvesting of people's private information?\r\n\r\nBrendan O'Hara: Is that still possible, given what has happened?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: They made a lot of changes within the past two weeks or\r\nso, and I am not sure what app developers are still allowed to gather at\r\nthis very moment. My feelings in general are that Facebook has been way\r\ntoo open with information and allowed app developers way too much\r\naccess, as well as allowing too much data to be gathered even through\r\ntheir simple search bar, as well as the password recovery function, which\r\njournalists have used for a while as well as companies seeking to exploit\r\nthe \"data\".\r\n\r\nWhat I mean there is there was a way to say, \"I have lost my password.\r\nHere is my account\", and it would give you a little thing that pops up and\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nsays, \"Okay, let me text you with this number and give you a code to\r\nrecover your password\". You are not trying to recover the password. You\r\nare trying to get that little phone number, so that then you can match it\r\nup to somebody else; just a little trick of the trade that people have been\r\nusing for a while.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of examples where Facebook has not been as great as it\r\ncould have been in protecting people's information. But are you meaning\r\nwithin the past two weeks, those changes?\r\n\r\nQ2570 Brendan O'Hara: It is a two-parter, isn't it? It is up until the last two\r\nweeks. It is what was in it for Facebook to build a platform that made\r\ndata abuse so easy to achieve.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It was profitable.\r\n\r\nQ2571 Brendan O'Hara: In what way?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: If you make your platform very open and easily spread\r\nand you give app developers incentives to use your platform and easily\r\ndevelop apps and gain data themselves, they are going to have every\r\nincentive to develop apps and gain data. Then when people use those\r\napps they have to log in to Facebook, so they have to have a Facebook\r\naccount. You have a spiralling graph of you have a platform and a bunch\r\nof happy app developers pushing a lot of apps out to the public. The\r\npublic has to have a Facebook account originally to use those apps, so\r\nthey will sign up to Facebook. It is a flowing lifecycle and then people see\r\nads that Facebook puts up because they created an account and\r\nFacebook makes money.\r\n\r\nQ2572 Brendan O'Hara: Do you think it would be fair then to say that\r\nFacebook deliberately created this system that was open to exploitation\r\nbecause it was profitable and this idea, which we have heard on\r\nnumerous occasions in this investigation, that they were naive and did\r\nnot quite know what they were creating and they have been as surprised\r\nas everyone else has been by these data breaches, is in fact nonsense?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It would be harsh to think of it as they created something\r\nexploitable because they thought it would make money. I think it is more\r\naccurate to think of it as, \"This was working, so we had incentive to keep\r\ndoing this and looking for more ways to make it work and it kind of\r\nevolved.\" They perhaps should have put some constraints around that\r\nevolution, but they did it in a way that was largely profitable, and they\r\nhad incentives to do that and they did not put as much control on it as\r\nthey should. I will just put it that way.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it was foreseeable? Probably. Whether or not they should\r\nhave foreseen it? Probably. They definitely had the minds and the talent\r\nto foresee it. I don't know if you could easily say they did it because it\r\nwas profitable and they knew it was exploitable but, yes, kind of.\r\n\r\nQ2573 Brendan O'Hara: How early in this process do you think Facebook would\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nhave been aware of the fact that developers would have been interested\r\nin the data for purposes that went way beyond simply adding social\r\nfunctionality to their applications?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I think Facebook was very much aware that developers\r\nwere interested in this, and I think that was part of the selling part to\r\ndevelopers. Not that they were actually selling to developers but the\r\nselling point to get developers to use their platform. I believe they very\r\nmuch understood that developers could gather as much data as Facebook\r\nwas allowing them to gather.\r\n\r\nQ2574 Brendan O'Hara: That is from a very early stage or was this a revelation\r\nthat would have appeared in 2014 when they then took action to prevent\r\nit, or did they know well in advance of that?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: When they were designing the system they would have\r\nknown what developers would be able to access. They would have just\r\nknown. They would not have necessarily known, \"And this is the key to\r\nour success\" or, \"We have to do this otherwise we won't get developers\".\r\nThey would just have known that developers can have access to this.\r\nWhether or not you have the cognitive dissonance to not realise what you\r\nare enabling is a question for somebody to interpret, but they definitely\r\nknew what developers could access.\r\n\r\nQ2575 Brendan O'Hara: Do you know whether any data derived from\r\nCambridge Analytica's models got loaded on to Facebook using their\r\ncustom audience feature?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I don't know the answer to that. If it was loaded on or\r\nnot, I don't know.\r\n\r\nQ2576 Brendan O'Hara: When you testified to the Canadian Committee you\r\ndiscovered that a Facebook app linked to AIQ was classified under the\r\ngames category of Facebook apps. Could you tell me a bit more about\r\nthat app and how you discovered that?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I wish I knew more about it because I find that very\r\nconfusing. The way I discovered that—and I have discovered one or two\r\naggregate AIQ-related Facebook apps since then—was looking through\r\nthis co-depository, finding reference to an app ID, looking it up through\r\nthe Facebook API explorer and seeing the name BBAGGIQ Reach, or\r\nsomething like that. A similar app to that was involved in the Breitbart's\r\nscraping that was going on. When the app ID is in the code and it makes\r\na reference to AggregateIQ in the name of the app, I consider that pretty\r\ngood evidence that it was AggregateIQ using that app in some fashion,\r\nand one of them was classified as a game. I don't know how they were\r\nusing it or if they were pushing it to people for any use. I don't know. I\r\nwish I knew more about it. I wish they would come forward and tell us\r\nwhy various apps on Facebook operated the way they did.\r\n\r\nQ2577 Brendan O'Hara: Do you know what the game was?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: No, I can get you the app ID but that is as close as I can\r\nget. It has been taken down, I believe, at this point. I don't know what\r\nthe game was or if it really was a game. That is just a category that\r\nsomebody had classified it under.\r\n\r\nQ2578 Brendan O'Hara: Do you know how long it remained active?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I do not. Facebook might be able to tell us.\r\n\r\nBrendan O'Hara: Yes, we may speak to them again.\r\n\r\nQ2579 Rebecca Pow: I want to pick on something that you said to the\r\nCanadian Committee on 17 April: \"the use of Facebook is not only about\r\nthe taking of information, but about the planting of information\". Could\r\nyou very briefly expand on that?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: What was the exact context about planting data? Can\r\nyou—\r\n\r\nRebecca Pow: You suggested that it was about planting information.\r\nYou were actually giving a warning, in fact, that people should keep their\r\neye open about \"the very focused efforts of others who rely on Facebook\r\nas a pillar of their operations\". Can you expand on that? It sounds\r\nsomewhat sinister.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Facebook and any platform that people interface with can\r\nbe used as a manipulation tool to influence opinions, and actions and\r\nbehaviours. An example that I gave on Twitter is of a way that you could\r\nuse advertisements not only in their original intended way to bring a\r\nmessage to somebody but to suppress a message.\r\n\r\nIf you know that a certain percentage of people are adverse to, let's say,\r\na certain colour—this group of people hates purple—if you don't want\r\npeople to see that your opponent is advertising a rally or whatever, you\r\ncan make sure there are purple ads shown when people click on an article\r\nabout that rally. If you understand what makes people hate something,\r\nyou can make sure that ads appear that bring about that hate. You can\r\ninfluence people to not like something almost as easily as you can\r\ninfluence somebody to like something. You just need to understand the\r\nmodelling, the graphs and all that stuff. Basically, all the work that has\r\nbeen done would enable that type of action to be taken.\r\n\r\nQ2580 Rebecca Pow: So, harmful basically? There is a harmful—\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: You could consider it that way. If you don't want your\r\nopponent to win, you might not see it as harmful. You would think of it as\r\nsuppressing or dissuading, but whether or not that is harmful is up for\r\ninterpretation. I personally see it as negative, bad, not good for society,\r\nbut that is just my personal interpretation.\r\n\r\nQ2581 Rebecca Pow: There was one other thing I wanted to follow on from\r\nthat. In that same interview you mentioned that there was a separate\r\nFacebook-related incident that has not been reported yet, involving—\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It has been reported; by now it has been.\r\n\r\nRebecca Pow: Yes. Is there anything else you wish to say about that or\r\nadd to that?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: That was the LocalBlox situation that you may have read\r\nUpGuard's report on. I have no reason to believe that it is related to the\r\ntopic that we are discussing today, other than the fact that it involved\r\nFacebook data. It involved a bunch besides Facebook, LinkedIn and\r\nTwitter and Zillow. It was a large aggregation of data, but it was a good\r\nexample of how somebody or a company can kind of abuse the Facebook\r\nsearching, or at least before the changes that have been made recently.\r\n\r\nQ2582 Giles Watling: You were talking a little while ago about companies\r\nclaiming not to store data. Would it be fair to say that they can claim to\r\nhave deleted data, not stored it, but in actual fact—the weasel words that\r\nyou mentioned—they know how to access it any time?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It has been my experience within the past few years of\r\ndata breach hunting that companies have very little incentive to lose\r\naccess to data. Generally, they do not lose access to data. That is the\r\nrule of thumb. Data is not really deleted, destroyed, got rid of. It is either\r\nsomebody's access to it is turned off but the administrator still has access\r\nto it, or it is archived on an offsite, or it is given to a partner. Shadow\r\ncopies always seem to exist. It is the way it just works out.\r\n\r\nQ2583 Giles Watling: It just lurks there somewhere in a cloud. I said a while\r\nback that it seems to me that data is the one thing that you can steal and\r\nleave where you found it, so it goes on that way. Then all that data, that\r\nreally sensitive data, the phone numbers, social security numbers, credit\r\ncard details I believe you can find out there, it is kind of still there. You\r\nfind it and then it is left there. Do you find any evidence that somebody,\r\nsome actor somewhere, is following you up and cleaning up, perhaps\r\ndeleting and going down there, or is it actually still there?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: The cycle of how things go in the research that I do at\r\nUpGuard is we find the data, we analyse the data to make sure that the\r\ndata breach is not a false situation, or fake dummy data, and once we are\r\nsatisfied that this is a situation that needs to be acted upon, we notify the\r\ncompany and make sure that they secure the data. There would not be\r\nsomebody needing to come by after I have gone through that whole\r\nthing, because we make sure the company locks it down. We notify them\r\nand we keep reminding them or we elevate it to somebody above them, if\r\nnecessary, to get it secured. We don't—\r\n\r\nQ2584 Giles Watling: You are satisfied that that actually happens all the way\r\ndown the line?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: The one that we find gets closed up. Maybe they opened\r\nup other ones somewhere else that we were unaware of, but we make\r\nsure that the exposure that we find gets secured.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ2585 Giles Watling: One of my earlier questions to you was that you are not\r\nalone in this. There are probably many hundreds, if not thousands, of\r\nother people doing the same kind of thing. When companies like AIQ and\r\nCambridge Analytica access data, would they be able to see who else has\r\naccessed that data? Is there any way that that can happen?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Can we put it in the sense of: if company A is holding the\r\ndata and company B accesses the data, can company B tell that others\r\nhave accessed the data?\r\n\r\nGiles Watling: Yes.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Not usually. There usually is not a public-facing log of\r\nwho else is accessing it. Theoretically you could make something that\r\nshows that data, but I do not commonly come across the ability to see\r\nwho else is accessing data, if you are the outside party accessing it.\r\n\r\nQ2586 Giles Watling: Right. There are no breadcrumbs leading to the\r\nmicrowave?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: You could theoretically do that. It would be possible, but\r\nI haven't come across that in an obvious sense. If you are alluding to\r\nways of collaboration that are hidden or not obvious, there are ways you\r\ncould do it, definitely, but there is not a log in front of you as soon as you\r\nfind any data saying, \"This person is also accessing it\", just thrown at\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nQ2587 Giles Watling: You do not leave a shadow?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It is just not obvious in front of you but there are ways\r\nyou could do that.\r\n\r\nQ2588 Ian C. Lucas: It is pretty clear that the information that AIQ was\r\ncollecting was being used for political campaigns. Would you agree with\r\nthat?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes.\r\n\r\nQ2589 Ian C. Lucas: In a referendum in the UK, different campaigns are\r\nforbidden from co-ordinating unless they declare their spending jointly.\r\nFrom your investigations, would you say the campaigns in favour of\r\nexiting the EU during the referendum were in fact co-ordinating through\r\nthe work of AIQ?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Again, if I was on a jury in America and asked that\r\nquestion, I would conclude that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, there was\r\nsome sort of collaboration going on. With all the evidence that I have\r\nseen, I do not think there is any ability for a reasonable, rational person\r\nto deny that there was some level of co-ordination or collaboration going\r\non between the pro-Brexit campaigns.\r\n\r\nQ2590 Ian C. Lucas: Why do you think that the EU referendum files were being\r\nuploaded on to the AIQ GitLab?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: What do you mean by the referendum files—like the\r\nprojects that were being worked on?\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: Also, by the different organisations, by Vote Leave, by\r\nDUP, and so on. Why do you think?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: They were being uploaded to which area?\r\n\r\nIan C. Lucas: To the AIQ GitLab. Is that what happened?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I think there may be a small confusion here. I don't\r\nbelieve that, for example, Vote Leave and Change Britain had direct\r\naccess to the GitLab repository. There was some relationship between the\r\ncampaign and AggregateIQ, and AggregateIQ's developers were working\r\non things for them but I do not think the campaign had direct access to\r\nthis particular repository. They may have had access to other things, but\r\nthis was a developer thing.\r\n\r\nQ2591 Chair: Would it be fair to say the campaigns—going back to your earlier\r\nevidence—stocked the fridge but then it is up to the developers to use\r\nthe ingredients?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: For example, you could e-mail a list of people that have\r\ndonated on your website, or whatever, when you start doing work with\r\nAIQ, and you could say, \"I want to include this in our escrow database\" or\r\nwhatever and contribute data all sorts of different ways. There is no limit\r\non the various ways you could contribute data, send files and synchronise\r\nand everything. AIQ could even provide tools to you, theoretically, that\r\nwould allow you to synchronise your data totally from your end to their\r\nservers, and none of this needs the campaign to have direct access to the\r\nactual database itself. It is a little bit of a different concept than I think\r\nyou were describing.\r\n\r\nQ2592 Ian C. Lucas: I understand that process where, for example, a political\r\nparty might have its own canvass returns, and employ a commercial\r\norganisation to target those people by supplying them with the\r\ninformation, but what I find difficult is that once they have done that and\r\ngo away after the election or after the referendum or whatever, what\r\nhappens to the information that has been passed over to the commercial\r\norganisation? It is very sensitive information that is owned by the political\r\nparty. How do you ensure that that information is not then held or moved\r\non to somebody else? What often happens—and I think there is evidence\r\nin your articles—is that information that was in the referendum, for\r\nexample, becomes useful for subsequent political campaigns, such as the\r\nConservative leadership campaign.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: That is part of the problem. There is no way to make sure\r\nthat goes away, and it has been my experience that it does not go away.\r\nThat is exactly one of the big problems in this type of industry.\r\n\r\nQ2593 Ian C. Lucas: It seems to me that at the moment our regulatory system\r\ncannot deal with that issue properly, because once the data is passed on\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nit is out there and impossible to pull back.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: That is very much the reality of the situation. Yes, data is\r\nsticky and flows out and does not oftentimes disappear. I think that is a\r\nreality we need to realise and figure out something to fix it.\r\n\r\nQ2594 Chair: Facebook yesterday talked about this nuclear history button they\r\nwant to introduce, but in some ways it is not worth very much, is it,\r\nbecause that old data, your old data trail, has probably been used by the\r\npeople that want to use it already? They have derived tools from it. They\r\nhave added you to their customer audience, and the fact that you can\r\njust delete that original data from Facebook really makes very little\r\ndifference to anyone.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I want to start with saying that in the past one to two\r\ndays I have been travelling and stuff, so I have not caught up on\r\nanything that Facebook said yesterday, for example, but from what you\r\ndescribe they have announced, yes, that does not seem like it would\r\nprovide much real security. It would make you feel a little better perhaps\r\nif you were not a security or data professional and knew how things really\r\nwork. But I can almost guarantee that data is going to exist in some way,\r\nshape or form continually. It is just the way this type of thing seems to\r\nwork. It may not appear in your Facebook profile anymore, or be able to\r\nbe looked up by an end user but, like you are describing, the modelling\r\nand the targeting and all that stuff has already been squeezed out of it.\r\n\r\nQ2595 Chair: Yes. How do you think companies that work in this way can be\r\nfully compliant with the European GDPR rules?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I want to be clear that I am not an expert in GDPR stuff.\r\nI do know a bit about it, and UpGuard is stepping into those waters, but I\r\nthink there is going to be a very hard-fought war between companies\r\nthat deal with data and GDPR enforcers. There is not an easy fit. It is\r\ngoing to be very bloody.\r\n\r\nQ2596 Chair: But one of the principles of GDPR is you can get your data back.\r\nChris Vickery: That is preposterous.\r\n\r\nQ2597 Chair: Also, under existing European law, pre-GDPR, there are\r\nrestrictions on who can hold data that contains information about your\r\npolitical beliefs or your religious interests or affiliation. From the process\r\nyou have described—and we have heard a lot about during this inquiry-\r\nall this information has been blended together and is held by multiple\r\nprivate organisations, which can already be considered to be in breach of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: You would be astounded, shocked and awed by the\r\namount of non-compliance with that requirement. This industry of big\r\ndata does not care about laws where you can't hold somebody's religious\r\npreference. They don't care about laws that restrict that. They are going\r\nto hold the data that they want to hold.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ2598 Chair: Yes, and they believe there is not very much anyone can do about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: That is the impression that I get, yes.\r\n\r\nQ2599 Chair: The dataset that you have been referring to, and the copy of\r\nwhich you have with you, is that mainly based on elections work that has\r\nbeen done, or does it include information about other projects that these\r\ncompanies were involved with?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: There are some non-political frameworks or information\r\nin there. There is reference to at least two different commercial\r\nadvertising networks in there. I have found that one of the AIQ\r\nemployees apparently was working with a commercial online advertising\r\ncompany at the same time that is headquartered in Switzerland and has\r\nsub-headquarters in Russia and the United States, so there are plenty of\r\nsigns, little pointers and breadcrumbs, leading to commercial ventures.\r\n\r\nQ2600 Chair: Can you say which two advertising networks you have in there?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I know we are having a private session after this. Could I\r\ntell you their exact names in the private session? The reason I say that is\r\nI have obtained a domain name that was at one time used by that group.\r\nI am gaining valuable information on it, as far as who is involved in this\r\nstuff, because there are autonomous systems still trying to connect to it,\r\nand if I say the name right now a lot of people are going to visit it and\r\nthe data that I gather will be ruined.\r\n\r\nChair: I completely understand that reason. We can discuss it further in\r\nthe private session.\r\n\r\nQ2601 Jo Stevens: We have talked about the Trump campaign and we have\r\ntalked about the referendum and elections elsewhere at the moment that\r\nhave happened. We have had evidence from Christopher Wylie and from\r\nBrittany Kaiser about the work of SCL in foreign elections. Specifically\r\nChris Wylie told us, and gave us some documentation, about a project\r\nthat AIQ had done for the Minister of National Security of Trinidad. There\r\nwas an email and there were some contract documents, and part of the\r\nproject was to go out and find a way of accessing raw internet service\r\nprovider data for the entire country and to monitor what people were\r\nbrowsing in that country.\r\n\r\nYou have written about the data you retrieved from the Trinidad and\r\nTobago election. Could you describe the connections that you found\r\nbetween AIQ, SCL and Cambridge Analytica?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I do not think myself, or as part of UpGuard, we have\r\ndone a large-scale report on the Trinidad-related files that are present. I\r\ndid confirm on Twitter that there is a fairly extensive Trinidad and Tobago\r\nproject on here that you will be very interested in reviewing, and there is\r\nprivate, what I would call PII—personally identifiable information—for a\r\nlarge number of people on this hard drive. Some questions will be\r\nanswered once a real analysis of that particular project is done.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ2602 Jo Stevens: When you say \"large number of people\", are you able to say\r\nroughly how much of the population of the country?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I wish I had spent more time looking into that one. My\r\ninitial feelings on looking into that project was that there is so much other\r\nstuff here. To me, it is hard to get people to care about foreign countries\r\nthat are not America and are not Brexit-related things. Usually when I\r\ndeal with large finds like this I will put the foreign countries off to the\r\nback burner and get to them later on, and I have not done a real good,\r\nhardcore analysis of the Trinidad files. I have looked through it but I\r\ncould not tell you exact numbers right now. That is not because I don't\r\ncare about other countries. It is just because it is hard to get the public\r\nto care about that stuff.\r\n\r\nQ2603 Jo Stevens: One other question on international influence campaigns\r\ninvolving these companies. Have you done any investigation into AIQ's\r\nrole in the current Irish referendum on whether or not the eighth\r\namendment will be repealed?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: There is a project in here for the campaign, Save the 8th,\r\nso AIQ has been involved to some degree. I am not sure to what degree\r\nbut it looks like at one point there was a website developed or they were\r\nworking on developing a website for a campaign called Save the 8th, so\r\nthere is some involvement there.\r\n\r\nQ2604 Jo Stevens: That is as far as you have gone with it and what you know\r\nabout it?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It is not an extensive project. It is the skeleton or maybe\r\nthe frame of a website. I have no idea what kind of relationship they\r\nhave with them or why they were related to that campaign or who is\r\nsetting up AIQ with these clients. I don't know.\r\n\r\nQ2605 Chair: On some of the other work, Brittany Kaiser told us that she was\r\nasked about whether she would be interested in working on some\r\nelections in other countries, which she declined to do. One was working\r\nwith Marine Le Pen or instructions with a view to working for Marine Le\r\nPen's party in France and also with AfD in Germany. Have you seen any\r\ninformation on the site that links AIQ or the other companies to those\r\nparties?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: No, I haven't. To be honest, I am not an expert in\r\nEuropean political situations, so there may be reference to those things\r\non here that I did not catch that just went over my head but no, I\r\nhaven't. To my knowledge, there is no French or other European\r\ncountries' projects related to them on here. When I say \"European\", I\r\nmean what we have mentioned already, other than what we have\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\nQ2606 Chair: We touched earlier on cryptocurrencies. Could you say a bit more\r\nabout the connections that you found between AIQ, Cambridge Analytica\r\nand SCL and cryptocurrencies and, in particular, the Midas token?\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: The Midas token is a little interesting. There is a project\r\nthat was present on the AIQ GitLab that had the Midas token website, the\r\ninitial coin offering website for it. The initial coin offering they like to think\r\nof it like an IPO, like a stock offering but it is for a cryptocurrency\r\ninstead. It was a site where you could buy tokens for the Midas token and\r\nthen, once it launches, you could have shares essentially of this Midas\r\nthing. It was interesting because on the site it had a $10,000 minimum\r\nbuy-in, so we are talking about large-scale investors here. The public-\r\nfacing live site disappeared shortly after I and UpGuard reported on the\r\nwhole AIQ situation.\r\n\r\nThe Midas token site had launched. I was confused by the AIQ response\r\nwhen they were asked about it. I believe in the Canadian Parliament they\r\nsaid that it had not actually launched and it was a client of theirs that was\r\nlooking into something. It had launched. The timer had gone down to\r\nzero, zero, zero, and I saw this on the live site and there is actually a\r\nlive, at this very moment, Amazon S3 bucket holding a script that will\r\nquery the Midas token status.\r\n\r\nI believe I have a screenshot to show you—not right now but in the\r\nprivate session—that shows there have been tokens sold and ethereum\r\ntransferred and cryptocurrencies are going through AIQ, at least the\r\nMidas token project. I don't know how far this extends or what other\r\ncryptocurrencies they may be involved in. I believe Cambridge Analytica\r\nhas admitted to being somewhat involved with something called Dragon\r\nCoin, which had to do with gambling and gaming on the other side of the\r\nplanet. Does that answer your question?\r\n\r\nThere was a comment in the GitLab in one of the areas where employees\r\ncan comment about making a specific badge for the Slack channel that\r\nwas talking about Midas token. I haven't seen the Slack channel but I\r\nknow that they had a channel on Slack that was talking about it.\r\n\r\nQ2607 Chair: Yes, I believe they have been asked—if it still exists—to provide\r\nchats from Slack to the Canadian Parliament.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Well, make sure that they provide all relevant Slack\r\nchannels. They may provide the AggregateIQ one, but this Midas one was\r\nseparate from the AggregateIQ one.\r\n\r\nQ2608 Chair: Yes. What do you think the interest is in cryptocurrency? Do you\r\nthink that is linked to their election work in any way?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: What their interest is in cryptocurrency?\r\n\r\nChair: Yes.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I don't want to speculate on their intent but I will go into\r\nwhat might be nice about cryptocurrency for groups like Cambridge\r\nAnalytica, SCL and AggregateIQ. There is the ability—and I am not saying\r\nthey did this—to transfer large amounts of funds very quickly in ways\r\nthat are completely unregulated. That is obviously a very attractive way\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nof operating with funds, if you are dealing with large amounts and you\r\ndon't want to pay taxes or transfer fees or anything like that. You can\r\nalso transfer data very easily, quickly and optionally in a permanent\r\nfashion. That way I believe Cambridge Analytica has said they were\r\nlooking to create a data information-based cryptocurrency at some point\r\ndown the road. There are a lot of different angles to the blockchain\r\ntechnology that would be very attractive, the money part being the most\r\nattractive probably.\r\n\r\nChair: Yes, indeed. We could all speculate as to why someone may want\r\nto do that.\r\n\r\nQ2609 Christian Matheson: Chris, I want to ask you a couple of questions\r\nabout Breitbart, if I may. I understand there is a reference within the\r\nGitLab files to Breitbart's scanning process and a reporting project. Does\r\nthis ring any bells with you?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Yes, there is a project in there that has to do with\r\nBreitbart and Breitbart's advertising, Breitbart's users, scanning and\r\nscraping Breitbart and I believe that will probably lead down a few rabbit\r\nholes in the future as more minds can look into this. It seems that\r\nBreitbart was part of some campaign of either gathering messaging for\r\nadvertisements or pulling messaging from Breitbart or giving it to\r\nBreitbart. I didn't see references to Breitbart UK but there is plenty of\r\ninteraction with the Breitbart US-based site.\r\n\r\nQ2610 Christian Matheson: You mention rabbit holes. What kind of\r\napplications might we see?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: If you wanted to automate the process or create a\r\nprocess of feeding imagery and phrases and advertising messages to the\r\nconservative alt-right movement in America or anywhere else, Breitbart\r\nwould be a wonderful provider of information, imagery, messaging that\r\nresonates with people. It would also give you the ability to pull\r\ncommentary and sentiment and further refine your messaging, see what\r\nworks and what doesn't. If you are working directly with Breitbart—\r\nCambridge Analytica I believe has claimed at one point they were a\r\ndistributor of Breitbart information—you have access to all the user\r\nanalytics, the visitation analytics, the interaction, the users themselves.\r\nYou have a wealth of information to pull from that resonates very quickly\r\nand easily with the alt-right movement.\r\n\r\nQ2611 Christian Matheson: Yes. There was an e-mail that Oczkowski, Head of\r\nProduct at Cambridge Analytica, sent in January stating that they were\r\nthe exclusive seller of Breitbart data.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Well, it may very well be the case that you will see the\r\nskeleton or basic framework of how that data is being gathered, or\r\ninteract with their process in the projects that are on this hard drive. I\r\nwould not be surprised if it turns out to be something that developed into\r\nwhat they are using today.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ2612 Christian Matheson: There was a reference in that email to DMP tags.\r\nDo you have any idea what they are, what that means?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Data management platform tags probably. That is\r\nprobably what it is, and tagging can be used in all sorts of ways but\r\ngenerally through track users, track topics, track key words, see who is\r\ninteracting with what and what sentiment and spreading it and what goes\r\nwhere. It is a very good way of figuring out what works and what does\r\nnot and who you should be targeting.\r\n\r\nQ2613 Giles Watling: One last little thing, and I know you have been travelling\r\nfor a couple of days and you have my sympathy. There is this article on\r\nRecode that Facebook will allow users to opt out of letting Facebook\r\ncollect their browsing history. It says it's \"arguably the company's biggest\r\nupdate since the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke\". It is sort of\r\nreactive, isn't it? If there is a history button you can say, \"I just want to\r\ndelete my history\". In your opinion, is there any way that you can make\r\nthat proactive so that you can opt out before, so as you post or whatever\r\nyou do on Facebook, it is deleted straightaway, so there is no way that\r\nthat data could be stored? Is that possible?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: Facebook could not gather it in the first place because\r\nthat is not something that, just by default, they have to have in order to\r\noperate just technically speaking. Then there is the option of you could\r\nhave browsers themselves somehow not hand that data over. By\r\nbrowsing history, do you mean specifically browsing through Facebook or\r\njust browsing, any history?\r\n\r\nQ2614 Giles Watling: I am using Facebook at this moment but browsing\r\ngenerally, yes.\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: In general, okay. Theoretically you could do it. There is\r\nno incentive for companies to do it, though, which is the biggest\r\nstumbling block because they gain great analytical understanding of user\r\nhabits, behaviours, opinions and learn how to hone their platform and be\r\nmore profitable off that data. I think the biggest block you will run into is\r\nthere being no incentive for companies to do that.\r\n\r\nQ2615 Giles Watling: Would it be fair to say you think that this much vaunted\r\nhistory delete button that Facebook is introducing, as of yesterday, is just\r\nshow casing, it has no value?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: It is kind of theatre in the way that you are describing it.\r\nI would say it would give people peace of mind and help some less tech\r\nsavvy people sleep better at night maybe, but as far as actual removing\r\nany sort of risk of personal information from getting further out there—\r\n\r\nGiles Watling: Someone like you coming along with—\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: I don't know if somebody like me would be able to take\r\nadvantage of it but advertisers and everybody. I still think there will be\r\nways that the data that advertisers want to pay Facebook for will\r\ncontinue to exist in one way or another.\r\n\r\nhouse of Commons\r\n\r\nQ2616 Jo Stevens: There was a huge data breach in 2016 from Uber. When you\r\nhave looked at this repository that you have described, have you ever\r\nseen any Uber data in there?\r\n\r\nChris Vickery: The only time I saw the word \"Uber\" exist in there—and I\r\nam not saying this is related to Uber itself—is reference to a script or\r\nsystem called \"Uber auth\". I don't know if they were experimenting with\r\nUber auth—I am assuming \"auth\" means authentication—for any\r\nparticular reason and I don't know if that is tied in any way to Uber the\r\ncompany. That is just the only time I saw the word \"Uber\" in any of the\r\nscripts, so that is the only little connection there.\r\n\r\nChair: That is great. Thank you very much for your public evidence. We\r\nare now going to move into a private session of the Committee, so I\r\nthank the people who have joined us but we now need to go into private\r\nsession.",

    "brochure_text": "Phase II\r\n\r\nRESEARCH PLAN (RP)\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\nA. Design\r\n\r\nThe project is designed in accordance with a proprietary research methodology, which utilizes a mixed qualitative and quantita-\r\ntive design. The data collection is emergent and iterative, moving from qualitative measures through to quantitative methods.\r\nThe typical research process can broadly be defined in three phases, each with its own aims and measures as detailed below:\r\n\r\n1.\tIdentification of Campaign Target Group(s)1: The initial phase focuses on identifying the groups that are most viable and\r\n\r\nrelevant to the Non-Desired Behavior (NDB) - in other words to reduce behaviors that support or are conducive to\r\nviolent Jihadist recruitment. This is done in part during the MSP (Phase I), but is confirmed with initial Field Research.\r\nThe outcome of this phase will be the identification of a number of potential Campaign Target Groups (CTGs).\r\n\r\n2.\tUnderstanding Campaign Target Group(s): The potential CTGs are investigated further in terms of their psychosocial\r\ncomposition and the environmental context in which they operate, using specifically targeted Field Research. The out-\r\ncome of this phase is a detailed description of a few highly relevant CTGs as well as emerging hypotheses on how to\r\ninfluence them in the most effective way. In addition, a baseline for Measures of Effectiveness (MOE) is established at\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n3.\tUnderstanding Target Audience(s)2: The final phase involves obtaining a detailed psychosocial understanding of the groups\r\n\r\nthat can be used to most effectively influence the CTGs - these groups are termed Target Audiences (TAs). Again, Field\r\nResearch is used to identify the psychosocial composition of the TAs and the environment in which they operate,\r\nthereby defining a clear influence path to the CTGs.\r\n\r\nB. Instruments\r\n\r\nTo ensure accuracy and validity, data on selected psychosocial research parameters are collected through a range of instru-\r\nments as follows:\r\n\r\nDesk-Based Research: Preliminary stage completed but ongoing throughout project lifetime\r\n\r\nSystematic remote research and data collection will be conducted from pre-existing available sources where appropriate,\r\nfor example, with relatively fixed, easily observable, and publicly available phenomena. This will also include obtaining locally\r\nproduced publications and other materials from the relevant areas. Priority will be given to trusted statistical sources, such as\r\nearlier studies, reports commissioned by NGOs, and official Government data (such as census information). The Desk-Based\r\nResearch will yield data which will then be used to establish basic Target Audience statistics and guide the subsequent research\r\ndesign and data collection. Strict standards of research will be adhered to, and where information is not available from depend-\r\nent sources, it will be derived from independent sources and critically evaluated.\r\n\r\nExpert Interviews: Preliminary stage completed but ongoing throughout project lifetime\r\n\r\nA series of Expert Interviews will be conducted with local, regional and topical experts on indigenous culture, tradition, history,\r\nand the current socio-political environment. Specifically, information will be obtained regarding Relevant Issues, Historic Con-\r\ntext, Language, Literacy, Channel Exposure, Channel Credibility, Noise, Values, Attitudes and Beliefs, Current Behavior, Common\r\nEnemies, Binary Opposition, and Motivations. The Interviews will be recorded, and subsequently transcribed.\r\n\r\nSemi-Structured Depth Interviews: To be commenced\r\n\r\nSemi-structured Depth Interviews will be used to develop a broader contextual understanding of the Non-Desired Behavior,\r\nthe various groups associated with the behavior and the influence pathways and groups. Each Interview will last between one\r\n\r\n6.\tCampaign Target Group refers to the group within the wider population that is closely linked or in some way contributing to the Project Objectives, and whose behavior\r\nthe campaign aims to change.\r\n\r\n7.\tCampaign Target Audience refers to the group within the wider population that has a direct influence over the Campaign Target Group, and towards whom the cam-\r\npaign ultimately is directed\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\nand two hours and they will be conducted by trained researchers in the local language.\r\n\r\nThe Interviews will be emergent and tailored to progress from the general to the specific; hence, they will be continuously\r\nrevised as recurrent themes emerge to refine and test specific hypotheses. In addition, the Interviews will yield data on a\r\nnumber of key parameters, including Channel Exposure, Source Credibility, Power Structures, Reward Structures, Motiva-\r\ntions, Values, Attitudes and Beliefs, Noise, Message Appeals, Decision Paths, Skills, Intent, Propensity for Change, Relevant\r\nIssues, Historic Context, Binary Oppositions, Language, and Literacy. The Interviews will be translated into English and\r\ntranscribed as summaries.\r\n\r\nQuestionnaire: To be commenced\r\n\r\nThe Questionnaire will be based on information obtained from initial semi-structured Depth Interviews and the Desk-\r\nBased Research. Responses will be recorded on either Likert scales or Semantic Differential scales. To prevent automated\r\nresponses, a number of the items will be reversed and the order of the questions relating to different parameters will\r\nbe alternated. Each Questionnaire is estimated to take approximately 30 minutes to complete and will be guided by the\r\nresearcher.\r\n\r\nThe Questionnaire will consist of 35 items, and questions will measure a range of psychosocial parameters including\r\nChannel Credibility, Channel Exposure, Source Credibility, Group Membership, Normative Affiliation, Values, Attitudes and\r\nBeliefs, Power Structures, Reward Structures, Motivations, Current Behavior, and Propensity for Change.\r\n\r\nThe Questionnaire also asks respondents to provide basic demographic information, including age, gender, location, level of\r\neducation, religious affiliation and ethnicity.\r\n\r\nRespondents and Recruitment: To be commenced\r\n\r\nThe research in each target location (i.e. Ma'rib and al-Mukalla) will include the three research phases described in Section\r\nA. For each of these phases, an independent stratified sampling technique representative of the known demographics of\r\nthe general and specific populations being examined will be employed. The total sample in each target location will include\r\n30 In-Depth Interviews and 300 guided interviews.\r\n\r\nNames will not be collected. All information collected will be categorized at the point of collection through pre-structured\r\nreporting methods. No association will be made between the respondent and answer sheets.\r\n\r\nAs stated in the research proposal, the series of target locations in each area reflect recent historical evidence of support\r\nfor, or membership of, Salafi-Jihadist organizations or their activities (e.g. Al-Qa'ida).\r\n\r\nTarget locations\r\nTarget Locations are:\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\nTarget Location\tGovernorate\tBrief Rationale\r\nMa’rib\tMa’rib\tMa’rib has been the location of recent terrorist attacks by Salafi-Jihadist networks and has a history of association with violent Jihadist activities.The Ma’rib foothills have been the focus of previous recruitment efforts by violent Jihadists.  Ma’rib has since mid-2006 been one of the main operating areas for Jund al-Yemen, an umbrella name for a number of overlapping Salafi-Jihadist networks who have carried out terrorist attacks in the area.This included the 2 July 2007 suicide VBIED attack on Spanish tourists at the Bilquis temple.This attack was attributed to the Khalid bin Walid Brigades, a group active in several locations in the Hadramout Governorate and the Ma’rib area in particular.\r\nAl-Mukalla\tHadramout\tAl-Mukalla has long been associated with Salafi-Jihadist activity. The area was a focus of operations for the Aden-Abyan Islamic Army in the late-1990’s, and thereafter the terrorist networks responsible for the attack on the oil tanker Limburg (2002) and the landside gates of Al-Mukalla’s main oil export terminals (2006).  The location has most recently been an area of operations for the Al-Qaqa’a bin Omar al- Tamimi Brigades, a militant group which open source reports suggest was led by veteran Jihadist Hamza al-Quayti until his death in a counterterrorism operation on 13 August 2008.AI-Quayti is understood to have had strong family ties to Al-Mukalla. Sporadic attacks on Yemeni security forces and oil infrastructure were reported in the Al-Mukalla area throughout 2008 and attributed to the al-Tamimi Brigades. Counterterrorist activities in and around Al-Mukalla during the same period suggest the area remains a violent Jihadist area of operations.  The al-Tamimi Brigades, which previously claimed responsibility for attacks under the umbrella name of Jund al-Yemen, is one of several semi-autonomous terrorist networks which reports suggest is now broadly aligned with the Shura council of Al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP),the recently declared Salafi Jihadist organization in Yemen.\r\n\r\nThe Research Leader, a local national with prior experience in research, will be responsible for recruiting, and managing\r\nresearch staff throughout the research phase of the project and ensuring the quality of the results. In addition, the local\r\nResearch Leader, an expert on the area and the community, will be responsible for recruiting the required number of re-\r\nspondents from a variety of locations, including schools, factories, etc.\r\n\r\nIn-Country Research Phases and Timeline\r\n\r\nThree phases of research will be completed in each target location:\r\n\r\nPhase I: Identification of Campaign Target Groups\r\n\r\nDuration: 5 days\r\n\r\nStart / Finish dates: 3rd-8th June 2009\r\n\r\nActivity: Respondents will be sourced from a range of different professions and socioeconomic groups. 33% will be 14-20\r\nyears old, 33% will be 21-30 years old, and 33% will be 31-55 years old; 60% of respondents will be male and 40% will be\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\nPhase 2: Investigation of Campaign Target Group(s)\r\n\r\nDuration: 22 days\r\n\r\nStart / Finish dates: 10th June - I st July 2009\r\n\r\nActivity:This phase will aim to further investigate and understand the Campaign Target Group(s).The research teams will\r\nconduct 15 semi-structured interviews and 300 guided questionnaires in each of the target locations.\r\n\r\nPhase 3: Investigation of Target Audience(s)\r\n\r\nDuration: 15 days\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\nStart / Finish dates: 2nd-7th July 2009\r\n\r\nActivity: The third phase will focus on understanding the Target Audience(s). The research teams will conduct nine further\r\ninterviews in each target location.\r\n\r\nNB;Timelines for each phase are approximate and are subject to change depending on circumstances in-theatre.\r\n\r\nC. Procedure\r\n\r\nResearch\r\n\r\nExperienced Research Leaders will be trained in the methodology over a five-day period. The Research Leaders will be\r\nsubsequently responsible for recruiting, training and managing their own teams of eight local researchers. The Research\r\nLeaders will receive ongoing guidance and feedback on their performance as and when required and no less than three\r\ntimes per week. In addition, the Research Leaders will be briefed over a two-day period at the end of the project.\r\n\r\nPreparation of Instruments\r\n\r\nAll research instruments will be translated into local languages by a qualified translator. To ensure accuracy of translation,\r\neach of the Research Leaders will subsequently provide a translation of the Questionnaire back to English. At this stage,\r\nany ambiguities in the translation will be addressed in the light of the feedback provided.\r\n\r\nField Research\r\n\r\nThe Field Research will take place between June 2009 and July 2009. A cover story will be used to explain the purpose of\r\nthe research to the researchers; the local researchers will not be informed of the objectives or sponsors of the study. The\r\nquestionnaire and interview protocol will be completely non-attributable to the original source.\r\n\r\nAll participation in the study will be entirely voluntary. Prior to completing the interview or the questionnaire, all partici-\r\npants will be given a rationale for the study (i.e., that the study is part of a university research programme or a market\r\nresearch programme) and they will be informed that their responses will be kept confidential. All personally identifiable\r\ninformation will be removed at the point of data recording. Moreover, respondents will be informed that they are not\r\nobliged to answer any questions that they did not feel comfortable with and that they could interrupt the study at any time\r\nwithout having to provide a reason or incur a penalty. Where applicable, explicit consent will be obtained by the researcher\r\nfor the audio-recording of interviews. Respondents will be debriefed afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe respondents will be allocated to either the Questionnaire group or the Depth-Interview group; no respondents will\r\ncomplete both. Respondents will be excluded if they do not match the demographic criteria.\r\n\r\nDepth Interviews\r\n\r\nExpert and Semi-Structured Interviews will be held in temporary field offices. Respondents will be given assurances that\r\nthey will not be able to be identified based on recorded data from the interviews. Prior to commencing the interview, the\r\ninterview format will be explained and informed consent will be obtained. Interviews will last on average 90 minutes (range\r\n60-120 minutes) and will be completed in one or two sittings. The interviews will follow a semi-structured format which\r\nwill be continuously revised in the light of emerging themes obtained from previous interviews to test and refine hypoth-\r\neses. Audio and video recording of interviews will be left to the discretion of the Research Leaders.\r\n\r\nQuestionnaires\r\n\r\nThe questionnaires will be completed individually in a temporary field office in the presence of the researcher who facili-\r\ntates the completion process. Where respondents are illiterate, the questionnaire will be conducted orally. The question-\r\nnaire will take around 30 minutes to complete and small incentives in the form of tea and snacks will be provided at the\r\nResearch Leaders' discretion.\r\n\r\nD.

Efforts will be made to ensure field work is completed as quickly as possible without compromising quality of research.\tTemporarily limit field work to unaffected areas or sus- pend field work as necessary. Recent kinetic CT operations by Yemeni security forces in and around target locations are generally of short dura- tion; field work could be re- sumed after a pause of a few days.

INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nProject Titania is a research and analysis study undertaken by Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) on behalf of\r\nArchimedes. The Target Country is the Republic of Yemen. Two Target Locations have been specified within Yemen:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe Governorate of Ma'rib (Ma'rib City).\r\n\r\n2.\tThe Governorate of Hadramout (Hadramout City).\r\n\r\nProject Titania consists of four phases, which also equate to the four deliverables due for submission:\r\n\r\nPhase I: MSP (Motivation and Segmentation Profile). The MSP summarizes the research done to date and is based on a\r\nnumber of Expert Interviews (EIs) and public domain Desk Based Research (DBR). The MSP details project progress and\r\nshould not be taken as a final deliverable - for example, DBR continues throughout the project lifetime.\r\n\r\nPhase II: RP (Research Plan). The RP provides logistical clarification on proposed field research, along with confirmation and\r\njustification of Target Locations. A Risk Register is also provided to help define how operational risks are mitigated to the\r\ngreatest degree possible.\r\n\r\nPhase III: Field. The field phase encapsulates all field research and preliminary analysis conducted on the various stages of\r\nfieldwork.\r\n\r\nPhase IV: Analysis & Report. The final phase involves secondary data analysis and its conversion into a final product.\r\n\r\nThis report consists of the deliverables due for Phase I: the MSP, and Phase II: the Research Plan.\r\n\r\nB. MSP OBJECTIVES\r\n\r\nThe aims of the MSP section are:\r\n\r\n1.\tTo confirm the objectives of Project Titania.\r\n\r\n2.\tTo identify the Non-Desired Behavior(s) (NDBs) underpinning the objectives of Project Titania.\r\n\r\n3.\tTo identify, through application of a unique behavioral methodology,1 which aspect of the NDB(s) can be best chal-\r\nlenged by Project Titania.\r\n\r\n4.\tTo identify factors which contribute to the existence and/or growth of the NDB(s), and provide initial explanations\r\nfor such factors.\r\n\r\n5.\tTo identify factors which contribute to the removal and/or challenging of the NDB(s), and provide initial explanations\r\nfor these.\r\n\r\nBy addressing these objectives, it is possible for Project Titania to enter Phase II of its lifetime: the production of a research\r\nplan (also included within this report).\r\n\r\nC. METHODOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe initial objective of any Strategic Communication Campaign is to develop a thorough understanding of the problem\r\nspace and the behavior that the Strategic Communication Campaign should aim to change. This will subsequently guide the\r\nselection of Campaign Target Groups (CTGs), Target Audiences (TAs) and Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs).\r\n\r\nI. Behavioral Status Quo (BSQ)\r\n\r\nThe BSQ is the first stage of the methodology and involves moving from the broader, unconstrained themes specified in\r\nthe Project Objectives, to more targeted and accomplishable Campaign Objectives.The successful outcome of the BSQ\r\ndepends on addressing two main criteria:\r\n\r\n1. The establishment of a working definition of the Non-Desired Behaviors (NDBs) - An NDB is a behavior closely\r\n\r\n1. The methodology implemented throughout this project has been created and refined by the Behavioral Dynamics Institute (BDi). The BDi is a body of\r\nbehavioral scientists whose work on behavioral methdologies is provided only to Strategc Communication Laboratories (SCL).\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nrelated to the Project Objectives, which can be targeted for change and, if changed, will have the highest likelihood of\r\nmeasurably contributing to the Project Objectives.\r\n\r\n2. The identification of more specific factors and behaviors that comprise the NDB, which can realistically be targeted\r\nvia a Strategic Communication Campaign.\r\n\r\n2. Method\r\n\r\nDetermining the BSQ involves a divergent thinking process that is underpinned by knowledge gathered from Desk Based\r\nResearch (DBR) and Expert Interviews (EIs). This information is analyzed using Behavioral Mapping Techniques (BMTs) and\r\nclustered into concepts and behaviors that make up the problem space surrounding the Project Objectives.\r\n\r\nDesk Based Research: Desk Based Research (DBR) refers to the systematic research and review of information from\r\nexisting open (and also often closed) sources that is relevant to the Project Objectives and NDB(s). DBR seeks to\r\nidentify, clarify and provide a theoretical understanding of the different factors that together make up the problem\r\nspace (i.e. factors, behaviors, groups, etc.) surrounding the NDB(s).\r\n\r\nPriority is given to official statistical sources such as National Censuses and Government Statistics. Where primary\r\nsources are unavailable, secondary sources are used. In these instances, efforts are made to cross-validate such\r\nsources of information and critically examine the content before inclusion into the DBR. The DBR is an ongoing\r\nprocess of refinement and informs all stages of the project.\r\n\r\nExpert Interviews: Expert Interviews (EIs) are conducted with local experts on indigenous culture, tradition, history\r\nand the current socio-political environment. The interviews are semi-structured and follow a loosely prescribed\r\nformat with open-ended questions around relevant topics. To date, a total of eight interviews have been conducted.\r\n\r\n3. Research Process and Results\r\n\r\nThe information gathered from DBR and Expert Interviews is summarized and converted into National and Regional MSPs\r\n(as included within this section of the report). Behavioral Mapping Techniques are used to analyze the findings in relation\r\nto the Project Objectives and to assist in the definition of the NDB(s).\r\n\r\nD. DEFINITION & EVALUATION OF NDB(s)\r\n\r\nAfter having considered the problem space surrounding the Project Objectives, one NDB was defined for Yemen: The\r\nsupport for, and engagement in, violent Jihadism.\r\n\r\nThe NDB, together its constituent behavioral factors and concepts, are displayed in Figure 1. Any Strategic Communication\r\nCampaign should aim to target the most relevant of these factors in order to achieve the Project Objectives.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nFigure 1. The Figure shows the basic Behavioral Mapping of the problem space, including the NDB,\r\nand key contributing factors.\r\n\r\nThe most realistic, relevant and measurable factors that contribute to the NDB were identified through the application of\r\na constrained set of research parameters. Each factor was analyzed against the following five research parameters:\r\n\r\n1.\tAccessibility: Accessibility refers to degree to which access can be gained to the groups implicated in the factor\r\nconsidered. For example, Yemeni Government policy-makers involved in funding violent Jihadism are substantially\r\nmore difficult to access than broad base community supporters who provide funding. Policy-making takes place\r\nbehind closed doors whereas the process of community support is more transparent.\r\n\r\n2.\tSalience of Impact: Salience of Impact is the magnitude of effect that a Strategic Communication Campaign is likely\r\nto have on the NDB. For example, attacking the logistical support provided to violent Jihadists might have a greater\r\nimpact on the NDB than changing people's opinion on the street.\r\n\r\n3.\tProblem Relevance: Problem Relevance is a measure of the degree to which the factor under consideration is\r\nrelevant to the Client's overall objectives. High impact or accessibility is of little importance if such levels are not\r\nconsistent with the prescribed aims and objectives.\r\n\r\n4.\tMeasurability: Measurability is the degree to which the factor, and any change in it, can be measured. For example,\r\nmeasuring the number of people attending a particular extremist mosque would be easier than measuring the\r\namount of funds donated from foreign charities in support of violent Jihadism.\r\n\r\n5.\tInfluenceability: Influenceability refers to the degree to which a Strategic Commuication Campaign is likely to have\r\na persuasive effect on the Target Audience's behavior.This takes into account a number of factors, such as the strength\r\nof belief and emotional involvement. For example, an Imam is likely to be less influenceable than a teenager when it\r\ncomes to religious matters.\r\n\r\nEach factor was rated in terms of its relative strength and weakness on a 5-point scale based on the information available.\r\nThe scale used reflects an assessment of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each research parameter. It should not\r\nbe regarded as an interval scale with equal intervals in between the points of the scale. The ratings are based on the DBR\r\nand Expert Interviews, and take into account:\r\n\r\nThe relationship of the concepts to the NDB;\r\n\r\nThe groups that are currently supportive of the NDB;\r\n\r\nExisting sentiments of opposition and the groups to which they belong;\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nBarriers to opposition.\r\n\r\nI. Community Support for, and Recruitment into violent Jihadism.\r\n\r\n\tRecruitment\tFunding\tTraining\tIdeological/Logistical Support\r\nAccessibility\t3.5\t1.5\t2\t3\r\nSalience of Impact\t4\t4\t3.5\t4\r\nProblem Relevance\t4\t4\t4\t3.5\r\nMeasurability\t3.5\t1\t3\t3\r\nInfluenceability\t4\t1.5\t3\t3\r\nTotal\t19\t12\t15.5\t16.5\r\nRank\t1\t4\t3\t2\r\n\r\nTable /.This table shows the ratings and aggregate ranks for each of the factors related to the NDB.\r\n\r\nThe analysis indicates that the most pragmatic, relevant and measureable factor underpinning the NDB (and so the opti-\r\nmal factor on which a Strategic Communication Campaign should be focused) is Recruitment into violent Jihadist groups.\r\nA second highly relevant factor in the case of Yemen is ideological/logistical support for violent Jihadism, as the research\r\nindicates that in many cases groups within the relevant regions provide safe havens for violent Jihadist operations.\r\n\r\nPotential Campaign Target Groups\r\n\r\nWhilst there are indications of sympathy for violent Jihadism within the tribal community, very little information is publicly\r\navailable about the psychosocial characteristics of these groups. It is anticipated that this will become clearer during the\r\nField Research. A number of relevant factors were identified within the population that were directly, or indirectly, related\r\nto recruitment into violent Jihadism and the provision of logistical/ideological support.\r\n\r\nSpecific attention was also given to factors that prevent recruitment into violent Jihadism.These factors and barriers are\r\noutlined in the National and Regional MSPs found later in this document.These factors will be researched further in the\r\nnext phase of the research methodology in order to determine the most suitable Campaign Target Group(s) (i.e. the\r\ngroups whose behavior the Strategic Communication Campaign aims to change).\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nNATIONAL MSP:Yemen\r\n\r\nYemen faces a host of domestic political and secu-\r\nrity challenges including Islamist militancy, sepa-\r\nratist conflict, civil, and tribal unrest, uncertainty\r\nsurrounding leadership succession, and potential\r\ninstability resulting from economic and social dep-\r\nrivation and a decline in the availability of natural\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nMany analysts view the decline of the Yemeni economy as the\r\nkey issue underpinning the country’s present and potential\r\nfuture security problems. Yemen is the poorest state in the\r\nArab World with inflation approaching 30% and unemployment\r\naround 40%.The country is heavily dependent on food imports,\r\nmaking it particularly vulnerable to sudden global rises in the\r\nprice of foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nThe sharp fell in oil revenues has placed enormous pressure on\r\nthe Yemeni economy, restricting the ability of the Government\r\nto control the country’s powerful tribal forces through tradi-\r\ntional patronage systems - President’s Saleh’s means of main-\r\ntaining a fragile stability in many ofYemen’s provinces.\r\n\r\nWhile the risk of state collapse is currently slim, central\r\nGovernment control over the country’s rural provinces is of-\r\nten minimal. Viewed through the lens of the ongoing global war against Al-Qa’ida and its affiliates, this is creating regional\r\nand international concern that lawless territories provide militant groups from the Gulf States with an ideal operational\r\nbase and sanctuary.\r\n\r\nSince 2006 Yemen has seen the re-emergence of an AI-Qa’ida-aligned terrorist network capable of carrying out a sus-\r\ntained and wide-ranging campaign against Yemeni security forces, energy sector targets, and foreign nationals. In January, an\r\namalgam of Salafi Jihadist networks coalesced with fugitive Saudi militants to form a new group with regional pretensions,\r\nAl-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).The group appears resilient and is able to recruit from a younger generation of\r\nwould-be Jihadists raised in the shadow of brutal terrorist tactics seen in theatres such as Iraq and Saudi Arabia.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Yemeni Government has been faced with growing dissent in the South. Demonstrations in 2007 by former\r\nSouth Yemen Army officers demanding higher pension payments were met by a heavy security force crackdown that served\r\nonly to inflame latent separatist tendencies among many Yemenis who have felt disenfranchised following the unification of\r\nthe country after the end of the civil war in 1994. Separatist sentiment has continued to rise this year with civil unrest and\r\nsome politicians have made open calls for independence for South Yemen.\r\n\r\nIn the Governorate of Sa’dah,a simmering four-year-old rebellion by members of the al-Houthi clan continues to drain pre-\r\ncious military resources. Although a cessation of hostilities is currently in place, the underlying grievances for the violence,\r\nnamely economic marginalization, a lack of infrastructure, and religious persecution (the al-Houthi’s are followers of the\r\nZaidi sect of Shia Islam), remain unresolved.This makes a return to open hostilities a strong possibility.\r\n\r\nThe development of fully-fledged democratic structures in Yemen has been curtailed by central Government meddling,\r\nnepotism, and corruption. President Ali Abdullah Saleh has consolidated his hold on power with the help of northern\r\ntribal connections and an informal patronage system, using oil revenues to win and placate powerful tribal leaders, radical\r\nIslamist Sheikhs, businessmen, and politicians.While this system has helped to ensure the regime’s survival, it has left many\r\nYemenis feeling politically disempowered. President Saleh is due to step down in 201 I,at which time elections are sched-\r\nuled. However, the regime’s clever manipulation of party politics has so far succeeded in preventing any potential strong\r\nsuccessors from emerging.\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n(\tADMINISTRATION\t^\t(\tDEMOGRAPHY\t^\tf\tCOMMUNICATIONS\t^\r\nCapital City: Sanaa, the largest city in Yemen with the largest population (1,972, Oil).  Head of State: President Ali Abdullah Saleh of the General Peoples Congress party (GPC) since May 1990 (former President of North Yemen).  Vice President: Maj.Gen.Abd al-Rab Mansur al-Hadi.  Head of Government: Prime Minister Ali Muhammed Mujawwar.  Administration Overview  The President, with input from the Prime Minister, chooses a Cabinet. All key Government post-holders are chosen by the President. There are two legislative houses: the Shura Council, appointed by the President;and the House of Representatives, chosen by popular vote.  There are a total of 19 Governorates in Yemen. For electoral and administrative purposes, Sana'a is treated as an additional Governorate.  Electoral Overview  Parliamentary elections scheduled for 2009 have been rescheduled for 2011. The official reasoning is that the coun- try needs time to reform its electoral system. The decision to postpone was made following an agreement between the General People's Congress (the rul- ing party) and the Joint Meeting Parties (one of the three major coalitions), and was a result of threats to boycott the elections by the main opposition parties due to perceptions that the preparations for voting were leading toward an unfair election process.  Following the 201 1 elections. President Saleh is constitutionally obliged to step down. However, at present, no clear suc- cessor has emerged. It is possible that power will pass to President Saleh's son Ahmed. Unconfirmed regional media reports have claimed that the President may seek a change in the constitution permitting him to serve another two five-year terms.\tPopulation Overview:  Yemen's Central Statistics Office (CSO) es- timated that the country's total population would be 22,880,000 by 2009 (the figure is based on the 2004 population census when the population was 19,685,000).  Half the population of Yemen is estimated by the CSO to be 16 years or under, with at least seven million people living below the poverty line. At least 5,726,081 people live in urban areas.  Population Statistics  •\tAnnual Average Population Growth Rate (%): 3.5.  •\tPopulation Density (Persons per sq. km.): 39.73.  •\tTotal Number of Households: 2,983,000 (2005), rising to an estimated 3,593,000 by 2010.  •\tAverage Household Size: 6.85 persons (2005),falling to an estimated  6.39 by 2010.  •\tGender ratio (No. males for every  100 females): 103.2.  •\tPopulation doubling time (yrs):23.  Life expectancy at birth (yrs):  •\tMale: 62.  •\tFemale: 63.8.  •\tBoth: 62.9.  Infant Mortality Rate per 1,000 live births:  •\tNewborn (less than 1 month): 37.3.  •\tInfants (up to lyr): 74.8.  •\tChildren (1 -4 yrs): 29.3.  •\tChildren (up to 5 yrs): 101.9.  Emigration  The most important contemporary de- mographic trend in Yemen has been the emigration of males between 15 and 45 years looking for work abroad. Pre-1990, Saudi Arabia was the most popular des- tination for the male workforce, but as a result of Yemen's lack of support for the US-led coalition in Iraq, Saudi Arabia blocked Yemenis' right to work in the country and most of this immigration now occurs illegally.\tThe Yemeni Ministry of Information administers all broadcasting through the Public Corporation for Radio and Television. It controls most of the writ- ten press and printing presses.  It is estimated that 5% of Yemenis read newspapers. Preliminary research dem- onstrates that Yemenis regard newspa- pers as non-credible sources.  Television and radio are potentially more important conduits especially since the literacy rate is so low, but further research is required in order to determine whether these are regarded by Yemenis as credible sources.  Anecdotal media reports suggest internet and blog sites are becom- ing more popular among educated Yemenis, but less than 1% of Yemen's population uses the Internet. Computer ownership equates to 1.5 computers per 100 citizens. Content is censored by the Government. Interestingly, many websites promoting violent Jihad are not among the websites subject to a Government ban.  The telephone network is outdated and the cost of running a landline or mobile is prohibitive for the majority ofYemen's poor population.  Example Points of Note  •\tThe\tbest-selling\tindependent  national newspaper in Yemen is al- Ayyam, whose offices are located in Aden. Best-selling state-controlled newspapers include Al-Jamhuriyah and  14 October.  •\tThere are a multitude of low- circulation official and semi-official newspapers, including at least 13 weekly publications by political and social groups.  •\tThe largest proportion of annual broadcast hours on Yemeni satellite TV concerns artistic and educational programming (25%),followed by drama (22%), politics and news (14.6%) (2004 data), and religious programming (9.9%) (2003).\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nf\tECONOMY\t^\tf RELIGION AND ETHNICITY V LANGUAGES AND LITERACY ^\t\r\nEconomy Overview  Yemen faces an impending economic cri- sis resulting from declining oil reserves. The economy is likely to be a driving force for future instability as the state budget is heavily reliant on revenue from oil supplies. The World Bank predicts that oil revenue will fall sharply within the next year and down to zero in 2017.  Agriculture  Agriculture: 33.59% agricultural land (2.9% arable). Key products include: fruit and vegetables, cereals and pulses, qat, coffee, cotton, dairy, live stock.  Trade and Industry  Trade has declined in Yemen since 2007. Export performance is one of the poor- est in recent years - down by 4.3% in 2007 and 5% in 2006. This is a direct consequence of declining oil production since 2000.  Key industries include: Crude oil pro- duction and petroleum refining. Other smaller scale industries include:Textiles, jewellery, building materials and glass making, handicrafts, commercial ship repair and small aluminum factories. Tea suppliers also occupy a significant por- tion of the market.  Key export commodities include: Crude oil, coffee, dried and salted fish, ores and minerals, and textiles and clothing. The exports of goods and services amount to 28% of the GDP and merchandise trade equates to 51% of the GDP. Important export destinations include East Asia, India and other Arab countries. Service exports amount to 7.3% of total exports.  Employment  Reports indicate that there were 188,000 graduates in 2006 and only 16,000 em- ployment opportunities.  •In 2005-06, 62.7% of the Yemeni workforce (citizens 15 yrs and over) were unemployed.  • The unemployment ratio for males was  1 1.9% and 46.4% for females.\tReligious Overview  There is a deep Muslim tradition in Yemen.The majority ofYemenis are Sunni Muslims from the Shafi school of Islamic Jurisprudence.There is a large Zaydi Shia group in the north of the country.  •\tMuslim (Sunni): 55%.  •\tMuslim (Shia):42%.  •\tChristian:\t3%.  Yemen also contains a very small number of Jews and Hindus.  Yemen is predominantly Arab but small populations of Afro-Arab, South Asians and Europeans are present.  Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs)  It is estimated that at any one time there are between 20,000 and 23,000 thousand displaced people in Yemen.This number recently peaked in 2008 when it was estimated that 180,000 persons had been internally displaced.  Factors cited as causing these high numbers include: Clashes between Government forces and Shia followers of the late Sheikh Badr Eddin al-Houth led to displacement in north Yemen at regu- lar intervals from 2004. An escalation of the fighting in 2007 along with the floods of 2008 added to the large increase in IDPs in 2008.\tMost Yemenis speak a dialect of Arabic as their first language. Modern Standard Arabic - the literary and cultural lan- guage of the Arab world is taught in schools. There are several main dia- lects, but small differences often occur depending on geographic areas. These include Hadrami Arabic, Sanaani Arabic, Ta’izzi-Adeni, Mehri and Soqoth, etc.  Literacy and Education  The official Yemeni Government illit- eracy rate for 2003 was 47%. (67.1 % fe- male). In 2007, male illiteracy was given as 23.7%.  There is a direct correlation between high rates of illiteracy and the lack of basic education. Although Yemen's laws provide for universal, compulsory, free education for children aged 6 to 15 years, the US Department of State re- ports that compulsory attendance is not enforced. One estimate places the cost of attendance as approximately US$10 per student per year - this equates to a significant proportion of a local man's annual salary. The high price can act as an additional deterrent.  School facilities and educational materi- als are of poor quality, classrooms are too few in number, and the teaching fac- ulty is inadequate. The World Bank has approved a series of education grants, including on rural education and girl schooling.  Yemen's government has in recent years increased spending on education—from 4.5% of GDP in 1995 to 9.6% of GDP in 2005.  Yemen has seven Government-funded universities, where the majority of stu- dents in higher education are enrolled. There are also 20 privately-funded universities, including the Al-lman University in Sana'a, founded by Salafist Cleric Abdul Majid Al-Zindani, who is classified by the US Treasury as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist as a result of his alleged support for Osama bin Laden.  A total of 188,343 students enrolled at Government universities in 2006-2007.  A further 45,000 people enrolled at privately-funded universities over the same period.\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n^FACTORS GENERATING SUPPORT FOR,AND RECRUITMENT INTO,VIOLENT JIHADISM\r\n\r\nPart of the initial Desk-Based Research (DBR) and Expert interview (El) phase of this Project was aimed at identify-\r\ning potential drivers and barriers to individuals’ engagement in violent Jihad in Yemen.The following are regarded as\r\npotential factors affecting radicalization and recruitment into violent Jihadist activities and may be subject to change\r\ndepending on further research findings:\r\n\r\nState policy of support for violent Jihadism\r\n\r\nYemen has had a difficult relationship with its domestic violent Jihadist constituency since large numbers of Yemenis\r\nvolunteered to travel to Afghanistan to join the Afghan Mujahideen fighting Soviet occupation forces between 1979-\r\n1989. At this time (and at several junctures since) the Government has actively encouraged its citizens, through both\r\nrhetoric and practical assistance, to participate in violent Jihadism in foreign conflict zones.To promote this policy, the\r\nstate has at times adopted a more relaxed approach to radical Islamist spiritual leaders in Yemen, providing clerical\r\nsanction for violent Jihadism abroad and publicly announcing such activities as a religious duty. A broad working\r\nhypothesis, therefore, is that over many years these state policies have conditioned some Yemenis to accept more\r\nreadily the conceptual notion that Jihad can be associated with theologically-sanctioned religious war.\r\n\r\nThere is a practical, as well as an ideological, legacy of such policies which might now serve as a continued driver of\r\nradicalization and support for violent Jihadism in a domestic setting. Anecdotal information suggests that contemporary\r\ncenters of recruitment for violent Jihadism in Yemen are closely linked to those previously associated with recruitment\r\nof volunteers for conflict in theatres such as Iraq and Afghanistan (e.g. certain mosques and religious schools which\r\nwere associated with certain radical Islamist spiritual leaders).\r\n\r\nEmergence of credible Jihadist leadership\r\n\r\nThe current leadership of Al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula revolves around a small cadre of experienced violent\r\nJihadists, many of them Political Security Organization prison escapees, former Guantanamo Bay inmates, or fugitive\r\nSaudi militants. In some cases these individuals are widely recognized and respected among the violent Jihadist fraternity,\r\nthus boosting the credibility of the organization and its attractiveness to potential recruits.\r\n\r\nPresence of Jihadist conflict veterans\r\n\r\nThe presence in Yemen of significant numbers of experienced veterans of violent Jihadism in theatres such as Iraq, Saudi\r\nArabia, Somalia, and Afghanistan provides young Yemenis with credible role models as well as individuals with whom\r\nthey can establish direct contact to further their developing extremist interests.\r\n\r\nGovernment policy of rewarding use of coercive force\r\n\r\nBoth tribal groups and violent Jihadists in Yemen have a history of coercive use of force against the Government\r\nin order to secure non-aggression pacts, prisoner releases, or largesse, among other concessions. Such beneficial\r\noutcomes of the use of tribal violence and protests reinforce the use of violence in the rural communities in general.\r\n\r\nIncrease of youth population\r\n\r\nResearch conducted by international aid and conflict resolution organizations has warned of the rapidly growing youth\r\npopulation in Yemen, specifically the large number of poorly-educated, socially excluded young men who might fall\r\nprey to violent Jihadist groups. Issues of concern cited by researchers have included: General social exclusion, a lack\r\nof understanding by parents and authorities of the needs of the youth, the increasing propensity of older generations\r\nto devalue and disrespect young people, a serious disconnect between the education system and the delivery of skills\r\nwhich might help youth to find jobs, and wider issues of falling living standards, power disparities, and oppressive\r\ntreatment by the state security apparatus. Such disenfranchised youth may be easy recruits for violent Jihadism.\r\n\r\nLinks between government and the United States\r\n\r\nSome Yemenis are suspicious about the nature of the Government’s relationship with the United States. Al-Qa’ida\r\npropagandists recently tried to play on this mistrust in statements alleging that the US was collaborating with the\r\nGovernment in a plan to occupy the country.The movement hopes that playing on such deeply entrenched opinions\r\nmight help it to secure local support and persuade more people to join their organization.\r\n\r\nTolerance for violence\r\n\r\nYemen is one of the most heavily armed societies in the world, with most adult males having ready access to firearms. It\r\nis not uncommon for tribal disputes to escalate to the use of armed force.The presence of weapons and the tolerance\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nof armed conflicts as a means to settle disputes make the violent aspect of violent Jihadism more acceptable.\r\n\r\nSocial Injustice in south Yemen\r\n\r\nDemonstrations in 2007 by former south Yemen Army officers demanding higher pension payments were met by a\r\nheavy security force crackdown which served only to inflame separatism amongst Yemenis who had felt disenfranchised\r\never since the unification of the country in 1990. Protests and public rallies have variously featured calls for equal rights\r\nfor south Yemenis, to outright calls for independence for the south. Many south Yemenis are aggrieved that northern\r\npatronage networks are receiving an unreasonably large share of oil revenues and business deals from the regime. The\r\ngrowing discontent is being directly exploited by Islamist extremist groups for recruitment and radicalization purposes.\r\n\r\nAnimosity toward official Government\r\n\r\nMany Yemenis in rural provinces demonstrate a much greater sense of local or tribal, rather than national, identity, and\r\nsee little connection between their national identity and the State, which proclaims itself to be a representative of that\r\nidentity. For many Yemenis the state is frequently viewed as another name for the political elite in Sana'a (who hold\r\nthe power in Yemen). Consequently, central Government activities in the country's more remote provinces are often\r\nviewed with mistrust and suspicion, and are sensitive to suggestions that central Government may be attempting to play\r\na more active role in their affairs.\r\n\r\nThe traditional system of state control through largesse has left many people feeling disempowered and distrustful of\r\ncentral Government. Many ordinary Yemenis regard central Government as weak and corrupt and of little relevance to\r\neveryday life, whilst others resent the selective patronage dealt out by the regime. Such unequal wealth distribution has\r\nbeen a significant driver of violent disorder in the south of the country in recent months. Growing southern separatist\r\nsentiment is being exploited by Al-Qa'ida in recent propaganda statements in which the group's leaders express their\r\nsupport for the growing southern separatist movement.\r\n\r\nLarge, poorly-governed territories\r\n\r\nYemeni central Government lacks a strong reach into many of the country's more remote tribal areas. Viewed\r\nthrough the lens of counterterrorism, this has raised concerns by regional and international powers that someYemeni\r\ntribal areas might offer safe havens for Al-Qa'ida, where the movement might pursue radicalization and recruitment\r\nactivities relatively free of serious interference from security forces.\r\n\r\nCultural Factors\r\n\r\nAnecdotal information suggests that tribal custom in Yemen places considerable emphasis on the importance of\r\nhospitality; if a person approaches a tribesman seeking shelter, the tribesman is duty bound to offer it even if the person\r\nhas committed a wrongdoing. Failure to do so is considered shameful. Several unnamed tribal leaders interviewed by\r\nregional media in recent weeks have been quoted as saying that they did not support an Al-Qa'ida presence in the\r\ncountry and would not actively support them, but that it would be a dishonorable act to actively notify the authorities\r\nof their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nTribal opportunism\r\n\r\nOutside the capital, Sana'a, tribalism is one of the dominant forces in everyday life, providing a much stronger informal\r\npower structure than that provided by officialdom. There is strong evidence that many tribes have long viewed\r\ntheir relations with central Government primarily in terms of economic benefit. In some cases, tribal leaders have\r\nshown little allegiance to central Government even though they may previously have been recipients of Government\r\nlargesse, considering it their right to broker deals which are first and foremost in the best interests of the tribe, even\r\nif this places them at odds with the wishes of central Government.\r\n\r\nWorsening economy\r\n\r\nYemen is the poorest state in the Arab world, yet uncertainty over the country's future prevents sustained integrated\r\ninvestment on a scale that would salvage its economy. Yemen relies heavily on oil and the sharp decrease in oil prices\r\nhas greatly damaged the Yemeni economy. Poverty in Yemen is extremely high, with four out of every ten people living\r\non less than $2 per day and at least seven million citizens living below the poverty line. This situation is aggravated by\r\nthe country's reliance on food imports, and so acute vulnerability to global price shocks. In the longer term, poverty is\r\npredicted to worsen as Yemen's oil reserves run dry. According to studies by the United Nations and USAID, growing\r\npoverty is contributing to an increase in social tension and instability.\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n^BARRIERSTO RECRUITMENT INTO VIOLENT JIHADISM\r\n\r\nTheological opposition to engagement in Jihad on home soil\r\n\r\nCounter-intuitive though it may initially seem, the beliefs of even some of the country’s most conservative Sunni\r\nIslamist constituencies may act as barriers to violent radicalization in Yemen.The country’s Islamic theological landscape\r\nis multi-faceted, with strong Sufi and Salafi currents being particularly prominent. However, it would be simplistic to\r\nsuggest that the presence of a large Salafi community would by its nature offer a potentially larger pool of would-be\r\nviolent Jihadists, much less act as a driver of radicalization. Many Sunni Muslims in Yemen follow branches of Salafism\r\nwhich, though they may share many of the fundamental theological underpinnings of the Salafi-Jihadist movement, are at\r\nodds with many Jihadists on exactly how this should be practiced. For example, while many Salafists in Yemen regard the\r\npresent Government as un-lslamic, they are fundamentally opposed on theological grounds to raising arms against it.\r\n\r\nThe daily struggle of survival detracts from the urge to fight against a far enemy\r\n\r\nSurveys of public opinion conducted by USAID and Yemen polling have demonstrated that issues such as terrorism and\r\nengagement in violent Jihadism are generally not high on the list of concerns of most Yemenis, who are typically more\r\nfocused on the day-to-day challenges of improving their living conditions, finding a job, and raising their income. Such\r\noverriding‘real-world’ concerns may act as a barrier to engagement of large numbers ofYemenis in violent Jihadism.\r\n\r\nPower of Government largesse\r\n\r\nA practice often resented by ordinary Yemenis, financial inducements have nevertheless proven an effective mechanism\r\nfor central Government to exercise at least some measure of influence over the more remote tribal regions of the\r\ncountry. Financial inducements or the promise of increased capital expenditure on local communities is one way in\r\nwhich the state has attempted to influence tribal leaders to encourage their communities to distance themselves from\r\nthe activities of extremists.\r\n\r\nIncreased state control over school curricula\r\n\r\nIn recent years the state has attempted to exercise a level of control over the curricula of the country’s more\r\nprominent Islamic schools and institutions. How far into the state religious education system this Government control\r\nextends, is not known.\r\n\r\nAnti-radicalization initiatives\r\n\r\nThe Government has attempted to dissuade the Yemeni public from involvement in extremism through public\r\ninformation broadcasts and even television dramas; a recent example was the 2008 film The Losing Bet’, which\r\nfocused on the radicalization and recruitment of a jobless Yemeni man into a violent Jihadist group and his ultimate\r\nparticipation in a suicide bombing.The success of such anti-radicalization initiatives is difficult to determine, though\r\nas a drama production the film proved popular.\r\n\r\n^POTENTIAL CAMPAIGN TARGET GROUPS (Potential CTGs)\r\n\r\nThe Potential Campaign Target Groups (Potential CTGs), also known as the Potential Target Audience List (PTAL)\r\nare a number of groups whose members may be selected as targets of a Strategic Communication Campaign in\r\norder to change a specific behavior.The targeted behavior must be clearly linked to the overarching project Non-\r\nDesired Behaviors (NDBs), and in many cases the behavior may be the same. Furthermore, Potential CTGs may be\r\nthe same or similar across a target country or region. For example, if the NDB was recruitment into violent Jihadist\r\norganizations in the FATA region of Pakistan, potential CTGs across all Tribal Agencies would feature the inclusion\r\nof young males.\r\n\r\nExamples of Potential CTGs are listed below. However, it should be noted that the SCL behavioral methodology\r\nallows for constant updating as data arrives. Consequently, a definitive Campaign Target Group can only be identified\r\nand confirmed once the first phase of Field Research has been completed.\r\n\r\nTarget  Locations\tPotential CTG\tExplanation\r\nMa rib & Hadramout\tYoung local tribesmen\tReports that the two attackers in the March suicide bombings were 18 and 20 years old suggest that violent Jihadist organizations have the ability to engage in at least some recruitment from local communities. Authorities are seeking 12 men in connection with the attacks whose ages range from 18-29, with all but one being between 18 and 25.\r\n\tMigrants\tMa’rib is a transit route for illegal immigration to Saudi Arabia from the Horn of Africa. Although the propensity of Yemen’s immigrant populations to involve themselves in violent Jihadism is not known at present, their social disenfran- chisement could make them susceptible to recruitment by violent Jihadist groups.\r\n\tReligious leaders/ Religious students\tInitial Desk-Based Research indicates that personal contact with radical Islamist spiritual leaders, in some cases through Islamic schools and study groups, is a particularly important element in the radicalization process in Yemen. Anecdotal reporting suggests that centers of potential violent Jihadist recruitment map closely to those already known to have a recent history of recruiting Yemenis for conflict abroad, such as Afghanistan.\r\n\tInfluential tribal figures\tGiven the importance of tribal affiliation to many Yemenis’ personal identity, as well as the prominent role often played by tribes in Yemeni society (particularly outside the capital), specific tribal authority figures should be considered a po- tential Campaign Target Group. Care must be taken when selecting potential candidates from among this group, however, as the seniority of a tribal figure does not necessarily always correlate directly with his degree of influence over fellow tribesmen, and the credibility of tribal figures of a given stratum will vary significantly between tribes.\r\n\r\nMa’rib Governate\r\nMA’RIB CITY\r\n\r\n‘The many levels of conflict operating in Ma’rib are complex, interlinked and multi-layered, and\r\nrooted in political, social and economic issues, internal and local, as well as external, regional and\r\ninternational.”1\r\n\r\nMa’rib Governate has a reputation for lawlessness, inter and in-\r\ntra-tribal violence and tribal resistance to central Government2,\r\nand Islamic militancy.Yemeni authorities describe Ma’rib as one\r\nof the three provinces which make up the so called Triangle of\r\nEvil’ (the other provinces being Shabwa and al-Jawf) - named\r\nbecause of the heavy militant presence3, whilst the murky world\r\nof tribal loyalties and militant Islamism has led some commen-\r\ntators to label Ma’rib as ‘Maribistan’. Ma’rib has the most heavily\r\narmed population in Yemen.\r\n\r\nNational and regional efforts aimed at political consolidation,\r\nsocial cohesion and economic development in Ma’rib have been\r\nundermined by a fragile security environment, characterized by\r\nweak governance (including corruption, general lawlessness,\r\nkidnappings, smuggling, people trafficking, etc.), continual tribal\r\nfeuding and governmental opposition, civil unrest (including\r\ndemonstrations by farmers, unemployed youth and tribes seek-\r\ning economic development assistance and a fair share in oil\r\nrevenues etc.), and sporadic attacks by local and foreign Islamist\r\nmilitants, loosely affiliated under the banner of Al-Qa’ida in\r\nYemen. The combination of geographic remoteness, the lack\r\nof effective state authority, lawlessness, inter-tribal conflict and\r\ngrievances between tribe and state, and the presence of multi-\r\nple oil and tourism targets, have made the Governate an ideal\r\noperating base for Al-Qa’ida.\r\n\r\nAl-Qa’ida is reported to use Ma’rib as an indoctrination, recruitment and training center, staging post for attacks in other\r\nGovernates (e.g. Sana’a), logistical hub (Ma’rib is known for the availability of arms and smuggling across the Yemen-Saudi\r\nArabia border), and safe haven for both local and international Islamic militants (e.g. militants from Saudi Arabia).\r\n\r\nCorruption and injustice are often cited as major driving factors behind recourse to extremism and radicalization. Politically\r\nmotivated tribal violence is often used as a means to extract central Government concessions. Political parties also use\r\nreligion as a means to gain support and strengthen their campaigns.\r\n\r\nSince the latter half of 2008, Ma’rib has witnessed a lull in Al-Qa’ida attacks, (although Al-Qa’ida cells have been notably\r\nactive in neighboring Hadramout Governorate), which has been attributed to Government efforts to arrest Al-Qa’ida\r\ncells, tribal mediation, and the deployment of extra security forces throughout the Governate instigated in the wake of the\r\n\r\n/.

Other important urban cent-\r\ners include:AI-Hosoun.\r\n\r\nOverview:\r\n\r\nMa’rib Governate is subdivided into 14\r\nDistricts and 15 Local Councils. The 14\r\nDistricts are: Al Abdiyah;AI Jubah; Bidbadah\r\nHarib; Harib Al Qaramsh; Jabal Murad\r\nMahliyah; Majzar; Ma’rib; Mar’ib City:\r\nMedghal; Raghwan; Rahabah; Sirwah.\r\n\r\nMa’rib is run by 288 Councillors (288 Male).\r\n\r\nGovernor of Ma’rib: Naji al-Zaidi.\r\n\r\nSecretary-General of the Local Council of\r\nMa’rib: Aber Ali Al-Shabwani.\r\n\r\nNumber of Societies, Unions, Syndicates\r\n(HQs) 2007: 9 (I Cultural Association,\r\n3 Social Associations and 5 Charity\r\nOrganizations).\r\n\r\nTraditional Informal Power\r\nStructures:\r\n\r\nPower in Ma'rib has traditionally been con-\r\ncentrated in the hands of the various tribal\r\ngroupings. Tribal Sheikhs are of paramount\r\nimportance. Many Sheikhs wield significant\r\ninfluence, whether independently or as\r\npart of the governmental structure (many\r\nSheikhs also belong to the governmental\r\nstructure, such as local councils).\r\n\r\nMa’rib Governate Total Population: 259,356,\r\n(Urban: 34,640, Rural: 224,716) (Male:\r\n138,515, Female: 120,841).\r\n\r\nTotal No. Households: 30,476 (Urban:4,227,\r\nRural: 26,250).\r\n\r\nThe population of Ma’rib is overwhelmingly\r\nrural and resides in densely populated set-\r\ntlements which are centered on traditional\r\nwater sources (e.g.Wadi Dahr.Wadi Sadd\r\nand Wadi Saba’).The population of Ma’rib is\r\npredominantly young.\r\n\r\nSex Ratio: (No. of Males per 100 Females)\r\n\r\nI 14.6.\r\n\r\nMigration\r\n\r\nMa’rib Governate is situated close to Saudi\r\nArabia and straddles traditional migration\r\nroutes (e.g. Al-Hosoun is well known as a\r\nstaging post for people trafficking of African\r\nmigrants into Saudi Arabia). Ma’rib is be-\r\nlieved to contain many illegal foreigners,\r\nsuch as Ethiopians.\r\n\r\nReports indicate that a significant number of\r\nlocals from Ma’rib have temporarily traveled\r\nabroad to partake in violent Jihadism and/\r\nor radicalization efforts in countries such as\r\nAfghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.\r\nSome violent Jihadists are believed to have\r\nresettled and/or sought safe haven in Ma’rib.\r\n\r\nAll forms of broadcasting (including audio-\r\nvisual and print media) are controlled by the\r\nMinistry of Information through the Public\r\nCorporation for Radio and Television. All\r\nforms of independent broadcasting are re-\r\nstricted and censorship is common.\r\n\r\nLanguages: Arabic (official). A variety of for-\r\neign languages are spoken by locals engaged\r\nin the tourist industry.\r\n\r\nLiteracy: Literacy rates in Ma’rib are\r\nextremely low compared to other\r\nGovernates. Approximately 30-40% of\r\nthe population is illiterate.\r\n\r\nTelevision: State-run Republic of Yemen\r\nTelevision operates two national channels\r\n(Channel One from Sana’a and Channel\r\nTwo from Aden). Access to Television is\r\nlimited and where available, often watched\r\nin communal settings.\r\n\r\nRadio: State-run Republic ofYemen Radio\r\noperates two national stations (General\r\nProgramme from Sana’a, and Second\r\nProgramme from Aden).\r\n\r\nNewsprint: Newsprint is heavily influ-\r\nenced by the Government (e.g. through\r\nthe control of printing presses, news-\r\npaper subsidies, licensing requirements\r\netc.). In addition to state-run publications\r\na number of political party-affiliated and\r\nindependent newspapers are also avail-\r\nable. Given that Ma’rib is predominantly\r\nrural and illiteracy rates are high, access\r\nto print media is particularly limited.\r\n\r\nInternet: Internet penetration in Ma’rib\r\nGovernate is virtually non-existent,\r\nparticularly in rural areas (although it is\r\navailable in Ma’rib city).\r\n\r\nNo. of Households who use a computer\r\nat home: 55 (Urban: 28, Rural: 27, outside\r\nhome: 146.\r\n\r\n64 Telecommunication Centers, 0\r\nInternet Cafes.\r\n\r\nWord of Mouth (WOM): Given\r\nthat Ma’rib is very poor, pre-\r\ndominantly remote and rural,\r\nhas high illiteracy rates, and lim-\r\nited access to all forms of me-\r\ndia, WOM remains the principle\r\nform of communication.\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nECONOMY\r\n\r\nVs\r\n\r\nRELIGION AND ETHNICITY\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL LANDSCAPE\r\n\r\nPoverty is widespread across Ma’rib.\r\nAlthough poverty rates have declined\r\nin recent years (mosdy due to oil-based\r\ngrowth), the poor, especially those in rural\r\nareas have not benefitted. 45.88% (Urban:\r\n17.95%, Rural: 50.05%) of people in Marib\r\nfall below the poverty line.\r\n\r\nAgriculture\r\n\r\nPeople in Marib are heavily dependent on\r\n(subsistence) irrigated agriculture (Marib is\r\none of Yemen's largest potato and tomato\r\nproducing regions). The agricultural sector\r\naccounts for more than 50% of employ-\r\nment. Agricultural production was mildly\r\naffected by the 2008 floods.\r\n\r\nOil and Gas\r\n\r\nThe oil and gas sector is an important\r\nsource of local revenue and employment.\r\nThe Manb-Jawf block oil field is Yemen's\r\nsecond most productive oil field after Masila\r\nin the Hadramout Governate. The bulk of\r\nYemen's gas reserves are concentrated in\r\nthe Ma'rib-Jawf fields. Marib is crossed by a\r\nnumber of key pipelines (e.g. Marib - Ra's Isa\r\npipeline). Ma'rib’s first gas power plant (341\r\nMW capacity) is expected to begin func-\r\ntioning by July 2009, with 2 more planned\r\n(totaling 800 MW).A new pipeline between\r\nMarib and Ma'abar, Dhamar Governate is\r\nalso planned.\r\n\r\nTourism\r\n\r\nThe tourism sector is a very important\r\nsource of local revenue and employment.\r\nMa’rib has a wealth of popular archaeo-\r\nlogical sites, including Mahram Bilqis, the\r\nMa’rib Dams, and Old Ma’rib City. However,\r\ntourism has been greatly affected by tribal\r\nkidnappings and Al-Qa'ida attacks.\r\n\r\nRemittances from workers abroad (e.g.\r\nSaudi Arabia) play a significant role in the\r\nlocal economy.\r\n\r\nYouth and adult unemployment and under-\r\nemployment are high.\r\n\r\nNumber of Beneficiaries of the Social\r\nWelfare Fund (2003-2007): 17,734.\r\n\r\nThe population of Ma’rib Governate is pre-\r\ndominantly Arab, with small minorities of\r\nimmigrant African Arabs. The vast majority\r\nfollow the Shafii school of Sunni Islam (fiqh).\r\n\r\nTribal Structures\r\n\r\nThe social, economic and political structure\r\nin Ma’rib is dominated by a highly strati-\r\nfied and segmented tribal system. Tribes\r\nare classified according to nobility, which\r\nis underpinned by genealogy, religious and\r\neducational status, knowledge, power and\r\nresponsibilities. Social stratification affects\r\nall aspects of social, political, economic, reli-\r\ngious, and kinship relationships. Each tribe\r\nis headed by a Sheikh. Tribal structures\r\nin Ma’rib pre-date Islam. Most tribes are\r\nrurally-based and engaged in (subsistence\r\nand commercial) agriculture having moved\r\nfrom nomadic to settled communities.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 powerful tribes in Ma'rib with\r\nover 70 different branches. The main two\r\nare theAbeideh and Al-Jalal.\r\n\r\nThe political climate in Ma’rib is under-\r\npinned by a fragile and distorted democracy,\r\nwhich is characterized by tension between\r\nlocal tribes and the central Government,\r\ndominated by the ruling General People’s\r\nCongress (GPC), headed by President Ali\r\nAbdullah Saleh. Traditional tribal power\r\nstructures remain strong in Ma’rib, and\r\nconsequently central Government control\r\nremains weak in all areas. Tribal leaders,\r\nmany of whom operate de facto semi-\r\nautonomous control over their respective\r\ntribal regions, routinely resist and/or fail\r\nto cooperate with central Government\r\ndictums.\r\n\r\nThe tribes of Ma’rib and the central\r\nGovernment have traditionally had a\r\nstrained relationship. Tribal elements\r\nhave often resorted to militancy, kidnap-\r\npings, extortion etc. in order to solve po-\r\nlitical disputes.Tribes routinely kidnap both\r\nYemenis and foreigners in order to extract\r\nGovernment concessions, and more re-\r\ncently have resorted to attacking oil instal-\r\nlations (e.g. Tribal elements have attacked\r\nthe oil pipeline near Safer.).\r\n\r\nLocal Sheiks are often members of the local\r\ncouncils. Distinctions between traditional\r\npower elites and Government bureaucracy\r\nare often weak at local levels.\r\n\r\nPolitical corruption and injustice is often\r\ncited as a major driving factor behind re-\r\ncourse to extremism and radicalization.\r\nPolitically-motivated violence is often used\r\nas a means to extract central Government\r\nconcessions. Political parties also use\r\nreligion as a means to gain support and\r\nstrengthen their campaigns.\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nf FACTORS GENERATING SUPPORT FOR,AND RECRUITMENT INTO,VIOLENT JIHADISM\r\n\r\nTribal identity / conflict\r\n\r\nMany tribes in Ma’rib often complain that the Government operates ‘a divide and rule’ policy with regard to Ma’rib.\r\nTribal elements assert that the Government tends to favor certain tribes who are ‘pro-Government’ and that many\r\ncentral Government officials often react negatively to the traditional tribal and social hierarchy and power structures\r\nin Ma’rib.This has been a cause of much resentment among tribesmen.\r\n\r\nViolence is widely acknowledged as a common recourse to settling inter-tribal disputes and as a means of voicing\r\ndissatisfaction with the state. It also hampers the development of proper democratic process, further isolating com-\r\nmunities from central Government, increasing feelings of disenfranchisement, and creating an environment in which\r\nextremist ideologies can take root.\r\n\r\nDisenfranchisement with the central Government\r\n\r\nTribal conflict is highly politicized in Ma’rib, as illustrated by local and parliamentary election results. Local leaders\r\nin Ma’rib have often expressed concern over central Government efforts to block the functioning of locally elected\r\nofficials - thereby preventing them from acting as agents of development and change in their communities. Such griev-\r\nances have fuelled local feelings of social exclusion, resentment, frustration and anger towards the Government, and in\r\nturn more conflict. Al-Qa’ida has been known to capitalize on this disenfranchisement with the central Government to\r\nsecure support from disaffected Tribesmen.4\r\n\r\nYouth unemployment, alienation and social exclusion\r\n\r\nIslamist extremism in Ma’rib, as elsewhere in Yemen, flourishes among alienated, disaffected, and disenfranchised youth.\r\nThe lack of access to, and poor quality of, state education facilities has meant that many children are enrolled in alter-\r\nnative forms of education, including religious institutes, some of which preach radical ideologies and act as breeding\r\ngrounds for radical Islamic terrorism.\r\n\r\nUnemployment in Ma’rib, particularly amongst the youth, is a significant contributing factor to youth alienation. Reports\r\nclaim that this has provided fertile ground for Islamic radicalization and militant recruitment (e.g. In September 2007\r\ndemonstrations demanding employment for at least half of the Ma’rib’s unemployed youth took place in a number of\r\nplaces in Ma’rib).5 Vulnerable youth lacking in life skills, education and self-esteem, are the primary target for Islamic\r\nradicalization and militant recruitment efforts. Many members of the youth face social exclusion and isolation both\r\nwithin their own families, tribes, and local communities and often feel a sense of hopelessness. Factors such as the lack\r\nof education, unemployment, poverty, lack of security and injustice, peer pressure etc. all contribute to the path to\r\nextremism, radicalization and militancy.\r\n\r\nPresence of foreign violent Jihadist militants\r\n\r\nMa’rib has a reputation for harboring foreign Islamist militants. Ma’rib (along with the Governates of Hadramout and\r\nAl-Jawf) is a transhipment point in people smuggling routes that operate across the porous Yemen-Saudi Arabia\r\nborder.6 Some Islamist militants from Saudi Arabia have reportedly crossed the border in order to escape authorities\r\nor join local terrorist networks in Ma’rib. According to the Combating Terrorism Centre at West Point, the latest Saudi\r\nGovernment list of 85 wanted terrorist suspects includes 26 of whom have reportedly fled to Yemen following comple-\r\ntion of Saudi rehabilitation programmes. I I of the 26 are former Saudi detainees of Guantanamo Bay\r\n\r\nImmigrants\r\n\r\nMa’rib is a transit route for illegal immigration to Saudi Arabia from the Horn of Africa. Although their propensity for\r\ninvolvement in violent Jihadism is not known at present, their social disenfranchisement could make them susceptible\r\nto recruitment by violent Jihadist groups.\r\n\r\nAvailability of arms\r\n\r\nMa’rib is the most heavily armed Governate in Yemen with an average of three weapons per male.The open carrying\r\nof weapons is standard practice in many areas.The availability of weapons has made it easier for tribal elements and\r\nradicals to translate their extremist views into militant activity.Yemen is also reportedly a major supplier of weapons\r\nto militant Jihadist groups operating throughout the region, including Israel, Sudan and Egypt.7\r\n\r\nf BARRIERSTO RECRUITMENT INTO VIOLENT JIHADISM\r\n\r\nDomestic living concerns\r\n\r\nA survey conducted by the Yemen Polling Centre in seven Governates (including Ma’rib) in 2008 found that respond-\r\nents considered the cost of living as the top problem facing Yemen, followed by poverty, the economy, unemployment,\r\nsecurity/terrorism, corruption and the spread of weapons. Most citizens remain preoccupied with local concerns such\r\nas employment, the economy, and harsh living conditions - these more immediate concerns, whilst they may breed\r\ndissatisfaction and act as drivers for radicalization, might equally distract many ordinary Yemenis from involvement in\r\nIslamist militancy.8\r\n\r\nCommunity reconciliation programmes\r\n\r\nThe inability of the Government to effectively address tribal conflict has led to local initiatives at tribal reconciliation.\r\nFor example, in 2003, a group of tribal leaders and influential social figures from the Governorates of Ma’rib, Al-Jawf\r\nand Shabwah, established the Yemen Organization for Development and Social Peace (YODSP), in an independently-led\r\neffort to end revenge killings and promote development in their respective Governorates. Such programmes suggest a\r\nstrong element of grassroots support for local conflict resolution.\r\n\r\nViews on Terrorism\r\n\r\nMost citizens of Ma’rib hold strong negative views concerning the notion of terrorist attacks carried out on Yemeni soil.\r\nIn 2008, a survey conducted by the Yemen Polling Centre in seven Governates (including Ma’rib) found that respondents\r\noverwhelmingly associated terrorism with murder/subversion/targeting of innocent/explosions/assassination/violence.9\r\n\r\nNGO Activity\r\n\r\nMa’rib appears a relatively permissive operating environment for NGO’s.There are a number of international and local\r\norganizations operating across Ma’rib, including those focused on working with Yemeni youth and other segments of\r\nthe population potentially vulnerable to radicalization. Examples of local civil society organizations operating in the\r\nMa’rib Governate include:\r\n\r\nthe US National Democratic Institution have also operated extensively in Ma’rib.\r\n\r\n'\"militant groups\r\n\r\n‘The (Al-Qa’ida) attacks... illustrate some of the problems the Yemeni government must navigate as it attempts to dismember\r\nAl-Qa’ida.This is not simply a two-sided battle between the government and Al-Qa’ida in Yemen, but rather one of multiple and\r\nshifting alliances among a variety of different actors.”10\r\n\r\nLocal and foreign Islamic militants affiliated in varying degrees to the resurgent Al-Qa’ida network are believed to\r\noperate across Ma’rib Governate. In recent years, Al-Qa’ida has attacked both Yemeni and Western targets in Ma’rib,\r\nmost notably foreign tourists, local security forces, and oil infrastructure (including oil pipelines, refineries and power\r\nstations). Al-Qa’ida has utilized a variety of planned attack methodologies in Ma’rib, including armed gun attacks, suicide\r\nbombs, and Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devise (VBIEDs), which indicate an increasing level of training, coordi-\r\nnation, sophistication and leadership.The attack on the Spanish tourists in July 2007,for example, was symbolic not just\r\nof the resurgence of Al-Qa’ida in Yemen, but also of the new power of younger, more assertive militants.\r\n\r\n‘The new generation is not the generation of Osama Bin Laden, it is the generation of Abu Musaeb al-Zarqawi, which is different\r\nfrom Al-Qa’ida, although the word Al-Qa’ida is used by some groups... It is the Iraq generation; they are young people who went\r\nthere for Jihad.They are inexperienced, misguided and wrongly mobilized.They think that the old generation has become unable\r\nto confront, and they (the old generation) are cowards and just agents or eyes against them.”11\r\n\r\nAl-Qa’ida is believed to use Ma’rib as a recruitment and training ground, as well as a ‘transit point’ and a ‘safe haven’\r\nfor militants operating across the region. For example, it has been reported by authorities that Abdeh Ruhaiqa from\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nMakal village, Raima, who was responsible for the killing of the Spanish tourists, was recruited by Hamza Ali Saleh al-\r\nDhayani and trained in the Wadi Abida area in Ma'rib. Other cell members included Nasser al-Wahishi, Qassim Al-Raimi,\r\nHamza Al-Qaeti, Ali Bin Ali Nasser Douha, Imad Al-Waeli, and Saudi national Naif Mohammed Al-Qahtani. The cell was\r\nsheltered by Naji Ali Saleh Jardan and Ali bin Ali Nasser Douha, who were later accused of killing Ma'rib's CID chief.\r\n\r\nThere are indications that Al-Qa'ida elements have utilized tribal customs, local grievances and frustrations in an effort\r\nto find safe haven and ferment tribal conflict in Ma'rib. Even tribesmen who are not sympathetic to Al-Qa'ida are often\r\nreluctant to hand over militants because of traditional tribal customs related to hospitality and generosity towards\r\nguests. There are reports that tribes disgruntled with the Government have been paid to provide havens for militants.\r\nMoreover, security forces are reluctant to move strongly against the tribes because, as one Government advisor put\r\nit, “...it becomes a war between the state and the tribes, which is not advisable.”'2 The Alliance Council of Ma'rib and\r\nAl-Jawf Tribes has indicated that any foreign attack on tribes may lead to attacks on U.S. and other foreign interests\r\nin the country. Analysts have suggested that geographic isolation, tribal nature, poverty, illiteracy, social and economic\r\nmarginalization and Government mismanagement all contribute to why tribes in Ma'rib give shelter to militants.\r\n\r\nAl-Qa'ida militants, including fighters returning from foreign Jihad (e.g. Afghanistan and Iraq etc.), and members fleeing\r\nsecurity crackdowns (e.g. Saudi Arabia), are believed to have established sanctuaries among a number of Yemeni tribes\r\nin Ma'rib. As a geographically remote and isolated Governate, strategically located astride (illegal) transit routes across\r\nthe Yemen - Saudi Arabia border, Ma'rib has been described as belonging to the “triangle of evil”'3 because of the heavy\r\nmilitant presence.\r\n\r\nDespite initial hesitancy by the Yemeni government to deal with Al-Qa'ida, Yemeni security forces have detained and/or\r\nkilled a number of Al-Qa'ida members in Ma'rib involved in planning and perpetrating terrorist attacks against Yemeni\r\nand Western targets, both in Yemen and abroad. Following the attack on the Spanish tourists in July 2007, security has\r\nbeen greatly increased across Ma'rib, which has led to a recent down turn in Al-Qa'ida attacks. President Ali Abdullah\r\nSaleh has made numerous appeals to Ma'rib tribesmen to stop supporting and harboring Al-Qa'ida. For example, in\r\nFebruary 2009, the president told tribal leaders in Ma'rib that: “Terrorism is a plague which hurts the people and develop-\r\nment...There will be no development as long as terrorism, sabotage and violence continue\"'4\r\n\r\nExamples of Al-Qa'ida Activity in Ma'rib:\r\n\r\nAl-Qa'ida activity in Ma'rib has centered on a number of geographic areas, most notably the Safer oil refinery. In addition\r\nto planned high profile ‘spectacular' attacks (such as those on foreign tourists), Al-Qa'ida groups have also engaged in\r\nlocalized skirmishes with Yemeni security forces. Al-Qa'ida have utilized a number of operational methodologies.\r\n\r\nJune 25, 2008 - An armed group, allegedly affiliated with Al-Qa'ida, claimed responsibility for an attack on the Safer Oil\r\nrefinery in Ma'rib. In a press release attributed to the so-called ‘Yemen Warriors Battalions', the group stated the goal\r\nof the attack as: “Rupturing the artery of Zionist - Crusader supply\" ' 5\r\n\r\nApril 16, 2008 - A suspected Al-Qa'ida remotely-controlled landmine killed three soldiers in the City of Ma'rib.According\r\nto local Government sources, the attack followed a series of attacks targeting a local military Commander (gunmen\r\nreportedly fired at the military Commander's car on 13th April, killing his driver and wounding four people).'6\r\n\r\nApril 12, 2008 - Two rockets were fired at the military headquarters of Ma'rib province by suspected Al-Qa'ida ele-\r\nments. '7\r\n\r\nFebruary 2008 - An Al-Qa'ida attack targeting an oil pipeline in Wadi Anshar was apparently foiled according to the\r\nMinistry of the Interior. Several sources cited Al-Qa'ida as responsible for the attacks. '8\r\n\r\nAugust 18, 2007 - Authorities announced uncovering a suicide attack plot by suspected returnee Iraqi Jihadists. The cell\r\nleader was Mohammad Yaqot (also known as Al-Lahji), suspected of involvement in the July 2 Ma'rib suicide attack on\r\nSpanish tourists. '9\r\n\r\nAugust 6, 2007 - Al-Qa'ida attacked a power station and a Government building in Ma'rib, causing a major power\r\noutage.20\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nAugust 5, 2007 - Security forces raided Al-Qa'ida hideouts in Ma'rib, which resulted in the killing of four Al-Qa'ida\r\nsuspects. Three of those killed were wanted by Yemeni authorities in relation to assassination of Ali Mahmoud Qasaylah,\r\nthe chief criminal investigator in Ma'rib, as well as the July 2nd attack on Spanish tourists.2'\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 2007 - Col. Ali Mahmoud Qusailah, head of Criminal Investigation Division (CID) in Ma'rib was ambushed and\r\nkilled. December 10, 2007 Security services apprehended a wanted member of Al-Qa'ida.22\r\n\r\nJuly 2, 2007 - Eight Spanish and two Yemeni nationals were killed, and a number of others injured, in an Al-Qa'ida suicide\r\nbomb attack in Ma'rib. Al-Qa'ida issued a warning that these attacks were: “Only the first spark”, and that future opera-\r\ntions would be: “Severe and bitter”.23\r\n\r\nSeptember 15, 2006 - Four Al-Qa'ida suicide bombers attacked the Safer oil refinery in Ma'rib, two of whom (Shafeq\r\nAhmed Omar Zaed and Omar Said Hassan Jar Allah) were among 23 Al-Qa'ida members who escaped from the\r\nPolitical Security Organization prison in Sana'a in February 2006.24\r\n\r\nNB:All statistical data unless otherwise indicated is given for Ma’rib Governate, is the most current available, and is derived from Yemen’s Central Statistical\r\nOrganization (e.g Statistical Yearbook 2007, National Census 2004, Household Budget Survey 2004,Transport and Communication Survey Report 2005,\r\nBuilding and Construction Survey 2006 etc.).

In recent years, a new generation of\r\nyounger, more radicalized homegrown Islamic militants, borne\r\nfrom the pool of disaffected, disenfranchised and vulnerable\r\n(often unemployed) youth, have stepped up attacks against\r\nPresident AN Abdullah Saleh’s regime and Western targets in\r\nthe country, including Hadramout.6\r\n\r\nIn recent years Hadramout has witnessed a notable increase\r\nin activity from local Al-Qa’ida cells, boosted by the February 2006 escape of 23 Al-Qa’ida members from the Political\r\nSecurity Organization prison in Sana’a, Jihadist returnees, and Al-Qa’ida fugitives from other international theaters.7 Al-\r\nQa’ida is reported to use Hadramout as a recruitment and training center, logistical hub, operations base, and safe haven.8\r\nAl-Qa’ida has also mounted a number of attacks in Hadramout, which have targeted foreign tourists (e.g. March 15,2009,\r\na suicide bomber killed four South Korean tourists in Shibam, and January 18, 2008 gunmen killed two Belgian tourists\r\nin Hajreen), Yemeni security forces (e.g. July 25, 2008, a suicide bomber attacked a Central Security Force compound in\r\nSayoun), and oil installations (e.g. September 15,2006, suicide bombers attacked theAl-Dhaba oil facility).9There is mount-\r\ning evidence that Al-Qa’ida members, including leadership elements, in Hadramout are becoming younger, increasingly\r\nradicalized and more coordinated.\r\n\r\nDespite initial hesitancy by the Yemeni Government to deal with AI-Qa’ida/0, Yemeni security forces have detained and/\r\nor killed a number of Al-Qa’ida members in Hadramout involved in planning and perpetrating terrorist attacks against\r\nYemeni and Western targets, both in Yemen and abroad. Although such successes have weakened Al-Qa’ida in Hadramout,\r\nthey are also likely to provoke further Al-Qa’ida retaliation, along the lines of the attack on the US Embassy in Sana’a on\r\nSeptember 17,2008. Given the lack of effective state authority and control in many areas of Hadramout, particularly rural\r\nareas, the abundance of‘soft’ oil and tourism targets, the pool of disaffected youth, and the presence of Al-Qa’ida including\r\nleadership elements, the potential remains for Al-Qa’ida to regroup and step up its campaign of radicalization and militancy\r\nin Hadramout.\r\n\r\nI. http://www.stratfor.com/memberships/120537/analysis/yemen_vbied_attack_first_hadramout\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nDEMOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nCOMMUNICATIONS\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Capital of Hadramout\r\nGovernate is Al Mukalla City.

Regarded as da’if (weak), Masakin are unarmed and scattered and have no territory or villages of their own.They are politically weak and exist under the protection of other groups.  •\tAbids ( or slaves) - Individuals who are descendants of former slaves, mainly from Africa.  •\tFamily Structures - Nuclear and Extended Family units play a central role in Hadhrami society. Men head, protect, provide, and speak for their families. Women generally perform traditional household, labor, and childcare roles.\tThe political climate in Yemen is underpinned by a fragile and distorted democracy, dominated at all levels by the ruling General People's Congress (GPC), headed by President Ali Abdullah Saleh.  •\tIslah Party, the main Islamist party, is the main opposition party in Hadramout. Although Islah has been accused of having connections to Islamic militants it has generally played a mediating role between the state and Yemen’s more conservative religious elements. Some analysts claim that Islah, far from encouraging radicalization has in fact blunted more extreme forms of Islam and militancy in Yemen.25  •\tThe Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) is also a significant local political force, although it has been increasingly supplanted by the more religious and tribally-orientated Islah Party. Secretary of the Yemeni Socialist Party in Hadramout: Mohamed Abdullah Al- Hammid.  •\tPolitical corruption and injustice is  often cited as a major driving factor behind recourse to extremism and radicalization.\tPolitically-motivated  violence is often used as a means to extract central Government concessions.26 Political parties also use religion as a means to gain support and strengthen their campaigns.\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nGenerating support forand recruitment into violent jihadism\r\n\r\nSouthern political / social grievances\r\n\r\nMany southern Yemenis harbor resentment of the northern counterparts. Grievances include; perceived subjugation\r\nof the south following national unification in 1990 and the civil war in 1994; injustice, corruption, and the perceived\r\ntheft of both public and private land by northern officials; embezzlement and unequal distribution of Government\r\nlargesse between the north and south of the country; economic mismanagement, and deterioration of living conditions\r\nfollowing Government mishandling of cleanup efforts in the wake of the 2008 flash floods which caused widespread\r\ndamage to the province. Such grievances, particularly those relating to perceived central Government interference in\r\nlocal affairs, are being directly exploited by Al-Qa’ida propagandists in order to secure local support.\r\n\r\nYouth alienation and social exclusion\r\n\r\nIslamist extremism in Hadramout,as elsewhere in Yemen, flourishes among alienated, disaffected, disenfranchised youth.\r\nEducation in Hadramout suffers from limited accessibility, poor attendance, high drop-out rates, and large educational\r\ndisparities between rich and poor.The lack of access to, and poor quality of, state education facilities has meant that\r\nmany children are enrolled in alternative forms of education, including religious institutes, some of which preach radical\r\nideologies and act as breeding grounds for radical Islamic terrorism.\r\n\r\nVulnerable (often unemployed) youth lacking in life skills and self-esteem, are the primary target for Islamist radicaliza-\r\ntion and militant recruitment efforts.Youth face social exclusion and isolation both within their own families, tribes, and\r\nlocal communities and often feel a sense of hopelessness. Factors such as the lack of education, unemployment, poverty,\r\nlack of security and injustice, peer pressure etc. all contribute to the path to extremism, radicalization and militancy.\r\n\r\nPresence of foreign Jihadist militants\r\n\r\nHadramout province has long been a bolt-hole for Islamist militants both foreign and domestic, and there are pock-\r\nets of sympathy for organizations such as Al-Qa’ida (Osama bin Laden’s fourth wife is the daughter of a prominent\r\nHadramout Sheikh), and in the early-mid-1990’s Al-Qa’ida reportedly made significant efforts to recruit fighters from\r\namong the province’s more religiously conservative communities. This cadre may act as a driver of radicalization\r\nbecause of the opportunities they afford those disposed toward involvement in militancy to make contact with com-\r\nmitted and experienced violent Jihadists.\r\n\r\nLoose state control\r\n\r\nMany areas of Hadramout are remote, rural expanses where central Government reach is poor. This has created a\r\npermissive environment in which violent Jihadist groups such as Al-Qa’ida can establish a presence relatively free of\r\nharassment from security forces.\r\n\r\nGarriersto recruitment into violent jihadism\r\n\r\nDomestic living concerns:\r\n\r\nA survey conducted by the Yemen Polling Centre in seven Governates (including Ma’rib) in 2008 found that respond-\r\nents considered the cost of living as the top problem facing Yemen, followed by poverty, the economy, unemployment,\r\nsecurity/ terrorism, corruption and the spread of weapons. Most citizens remain preoccupied with local concerns such\r\nas employment, the economy, and harsh living conditions - these more immediate concerns, whilst they may breed\r\ndissatisfaction and act as drivers for radicalization, might equally distract many ordinary Yemenis from involvement in\r\nIslamist militancy.\r\n\r\nViews on Terrorism\r\n\r\nLike Ma’rib, public opinion polling suggests most Hadramis hold strong negative views concerning the notion of ter-\r\nrorist attacks carried out on Yemeni soil.The 2008 Yemen Polling Centre survey in Hadramout found that terrorism\r\nwas an activity generally disliked by citizens and associated closely with murder and the targeting of innocent civilians.\r\n\r\nAnti-radicalization initiatives\r\n\r\nThere are a number of well-known religious schools in Hadramout, several of which have run their own study pro-\r\ngrammes aimed at countering the spread of radical Islamist ideologies.\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\n^MILITANT GROUPS\r\nAl-Qa’ida in Hadramout\r\n\r\nLocal and foreign Islamic militants affiliated in varying degrees to the country’s resurgent Al-Qa’ida network are be-\r\nlieved to operate across Hadramout Governate, including in Al Mukalla city. In recent years,Al-Qa’ida has attacked both\r\nYemeni and Western targets in Hadramout, most notably foreign tourists, the security forces, and oil installations. Al-\r\nQa’ida has used a variety of planned attack methodologies in Hadramout, including armed gun attacks, mortar attacks,\r\nthe use of suicide vests, and Improvised Explosive Devices (lEDs) and Vehicle Borne Improvised Explosive Devices\r\n(VBIEDs), which indicate an increasing level of training, coordination, sophistication and leadership.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Al-Qa’ida in Hadramout is engaged in a sophisticated online Information Campaign consisting of ideo-\r\nlogically framed propaganda, including videos, audio recordings and written communiques that include, for example,\r\ndemands for the release of prisoners, the expulsion of non-Muslims from the Arabian Peninsula, and the claiming of\r\nresponsibility for attacks. Al-Qa’ida’s ideology, demands and operations are chronicled in its online magazine, Sada Al-\r\nMalahim (the Echo of Battles).\r\n\r\nAs the ancestral homeland of Al-Qa’ida leader Osama bin Laden, Hadramout has a long association with Islamic\r\nradicalization and militancy, particularly among youth, returnee Jihadists (from Iraq and Afghanistan etc.) and alienated\r\nstrands of local social society. In recent years, a‘new generation’ of more radicalized homegrown militants, borne from\r\nthe pool of alienated, disaffected, disenfranchised and vulnerable (often unemployed) youth, have stepped up attacks\r\nagainst President Ali Abdullah Saleh’s regime and Western targets in Hadramout.This new generation, some of whom\r\nhave fought in current international theaters of armed Jihad (e.g. Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan etc.) reportedly reject\r\nwhat has been described by some commentators as the tacit non-aggression pact between the Yemeni government\r\nand ‘older’Yemeni mujahedeen who returned home after the Afghan-Soviet conflict and who agreed not to engage in\r\nmilitant actions within Yemen.This younger generation advocate for confrontation with both the ‘Near’ (hostile Arab\r\nregimes) and ‘Far’ (US / the West) enemies, and therefore consider both Government and foreign targets in Yemen as\r\nlegitimate targets.\r\n\r\nAl-Qa’ida in Hadramout consists of a number of independent, loosely-affiliated groups and/or cells of militant Islamists\r\noperating under different names (but all named after companions of the Prophet Muhammad), with differing levels of\r\ngeographic space (both within and outside Hadramout), operational capacity, and different (sometimes) prominent\r\nAl-Qa’ida leaders.While such groups previously shared a minimal organizational overlap, the emergence of Al-Qa’ida in\r\nthe Arabian Peninsula, the new Yemen-based regional Jihadist umbrella group, may now result in greater coordination\r\nof their activities.\r\n\r\nExamples of Al-Qa’ida cells active in the Hadramout area in 2008 included:\r\n\r\nThe Khalid Bin Al-Waleed brigade; believed to be closely affiliated with prominent Al-Qa’ida leader Qassim Al-Raimi,\r\nwho escaped jail in Sana’a in February 2006 and remains at large. The group is believed to operate across Yemen,\r\nincluding Sana’a and Hadramout. It was reportedly responsible for most of the high profile attacks on Westerners in\r\nHadramout since 2006, such as the January 18,2008 killing of two Belgian tourists and two Yemeni drivers near Hajreen,\r\nDaw’an District.\r\n\r\nTheAl-Qaqaa Bin Omar Al-Tamimi brigade; thought to be closely associated with (now deceased) prominent Al-Qa’ida\r\nleader Hamza Al-Quwaiti.The group is believed to operate from Aden to Mukalla and along the Wadi Douan / Sayoun\r\n/Tarim corridor. It was reportedly responsible for the 25,July 2008 suicide bomb attack on a central security forces\r\ncompound in Sayoun.\r\n\r\nThe Al-Muthanna Harith Al-Shibani brigade; active around Shibam and is believed to be responsible for a spate of\r\nskirmishes with, and attacks on,Yemeni security forces in Wadi Hadramout around Shibam.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of recent propaganda videos and the January edition of Sada al-Malahim suggest these networks, in particular\r\nthe Khalid Bin Al-Walid Brigades, are now closely affiliated with Al-Qa’ida.\r\n\r\nDespite a Government crackdown and a number of high profile arrests, in recent years Hadramout has witnessed a\r\nnotable increase in activity from local Al-Qa’ida cells, boosted by the February 2006 escape of 23 Al-Qa’ida members\r\nfrom the Political Security Organization prison in Sana’a, Jihadist returnees, and Al-Qa’ida fugitives from other inter-\r\nnational theaters, most notably Saudi Arabia. Al-Qa’ida is reported to use Hadramout as a recruitment and training\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\ncenter, logistical hub, operations base, and safe haven. Al-Qa'ida has mounted a number of attacks in Hadramout, which\r\nhave targeted foreign tourists (e.g. March 15, 2009, a suicide bomber killed four South Korean tourists in Shibam, and\r\nJanuary 18, 2008 gunmen killed two Belgian tourists in Hajreen), Yemeni security forces (e.g. July 25, 2008, a suicide\r\nbomber attacked a central security forces compound in Sayoun), and oil installations (e.g. September 15, 2006, suicide\r\nbombers attacked the Al-Dhaba oil facility). In addition to such high profile attacks Al-Qa'ida has been involved in minor\r\ngun battles and skirmishes with Yemeni security forces in a number of areas in Hadramout, including Al Mukalla city and\r\nWadi Hadramout, west of Shibam.\r\n\r\nDespite initial hesitancy by the Yemeni Government to deal with Al-Qa'ida, Yemeni security forces have detained\r\nand/or killed a number of Al-Qa'ida members in Hadramout involved in planning and perpetrating terrorist attacks\r\nagainst Yemeni and Western targets, both in Yemen and abroad. Although such successes have weakened Al-Qa'ida in\r\nHadramout, they are also likely to provoke further Al-Qa'ida retaliation, along the lines of the sophisticated attack on\r\nthe US Embassy in Sana'a on September 17, 2008. Given the lack of effective state authority and control in many areas\r\nof Hadramout, particularly rural areas, the abundance of ‘soft' oil and tourism targets, the pool of disaffected youth, and\r\nthe presence of Al-Qa'ida, including leadership elements, the potential remains for Al-Qa'ida to regroup and step up its\r\ncampaign of radicalization and militancy in Hadramout.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Al-Qa'ida a number of foreign Islamic militant groups, such as Egyptian Islamic Jihad, are believed to be\r\nactive in, or have links to, Yemen, although the extent to which they operate in Hadramout is unknown.\r\n\r\nExamples of Al-Qa'ida Activity in Hadramout:28\r\n\r\nAl-Qa'ida activity in Hadramout has centered on a number of geographic areas, most notably Al Mukalla and Shibam.\r\nIn addition to planned high profile ‘spectacular' attacks (such as those on foreign tourists), Al-Qa'ida groups have also\r\nengaged in localized skirmishes with Yemeni security forces.\r\n\r\nMarch 15, 2009 - A suicide bomber killed four South Korean tourists and injured a number of Yemenis in Shibam.\r\n\r\nAugust 19, 2008 - Five members of Al-Qa'ida were arrested in Al Qatn District and one in Al Mukalla city. Security\r\nforces reportedly uncovered weapons, explosives, military uniforms and a workshop for assembling car bombs.\r\n\r\nAugust 11,2008 - Hamza Al-Quwaiti, an ALQ leader who escaped jail in Sana'a in February 2006 was killed by security\r\nforces along with four other Al-Qa'ida members near Tarim._Security forces reportedly uncovered weapons, explosives,\r\nand materials to build car bombs.\r\n\r\nJuly 25, 2008 - Ahmed Bin Said Omar Al-Masjari, carried out a suicide VBIED attack on a Central Security Force com-\r\npound in Sayoun, killing eight. Al-Masjari, who was born in Saudi Arabia, was a medical student at Hadramout University.\r\n\r\nApril 26, 2008 - Al-Qa'ida fired mortars at a Yemeni Army compound north of Al-Mukalla City.\r\n\r\nApril 22, 2008 - Al-Qa'ida fired mortars at a central security force compound in Sayoun.\r\n\r\nMarch 29, 2008 - Al-Qa'ida fired mortars on a Calvalley Petroleum site in Wadi Hadramout (Block 9).\r\n\r\nMarch 27, 2008 - Al-Qa'ida launched an IED attack on the Total pipeline (Block 10) south-east of Shibam.\r\n\r\nMarch 1,2008 - Al-Qa'ida skirmished with police near Al-Mukalla city stadium.\r\n\r\nJanuary 18, 2008 - Al-Qa'ida gunmen killed two Belgian tourists and two Yemeni drivers in a small arms ambush near\r\nHajreen, Daw'an District.\r\n\r\nDecember 13, 2007 - A number of security force personnel were injured in two bomb explosions in Hadramout\r\nreportedly linked to Al-Qa'ida.\r\n\r\nSeptember 15, 2006 - Al-Qa'ida attacked the Al-Dhaba oil facility. in a double suicide VBIED attack.\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\nNB:All statistical data unless otherwise indicated is given for Hadramout Governate, is the most current available, and is derived from Yemen’s Central\r\nStatistical Organization (e.g. Statistical Yearbook 2007, National Census 2004, Household Budget Survey 2004, Transport and Communication Survey\r\nReport 2005, Building and Construction Survey 2006 etc.).

Al-Qa’ida advocates for confrontation with both the ‘Near’ (hostile Arab reg'mes) and ‘Far’ (US / the West) enemies. Ai-Qa’ida’s ideology,\r\ndemands and operations are chronicled in its online magazine, Sada Al-Malahim (SM) (the Echo of Battles).\r\n\r\n6.\tA new generation of younger Al-Qa’ida radicals, such as Hamza Al-Quyat (killed in Hadramout in August 2008) has recently emerged in Hadramout. The\r\nnew generation reportedly rejects what has been described by some commentators as the tacit non-aggression pact between the Yemeni government and\r\n‘older’Yemeni mujahedeen who returned home after the Afghan-Soviet conflict and under which such fighters agreed not to engage in militant actions\r\nwithin Yemen. Unlike their forebears, this younger more radicalized generation consider both government and foreign targets in Yemen as legitimate targets.\r\n\r\n7.\tReports indicate that crackdowns on Al-Qa’ida in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere have forced a number of Al-Qa’ida operatives to relocate\r\nto Yemen, some of whom are believed to operate in Hadramout Governate. Despite increased international border security, fugitive Islamist militants from\r\nthroughout the Gulf region are reported to (regularly) cross what is still considered a porous border between Saudi Arabia and Yemen, including Hadramout\r\nGovernate (e.g. NayifAl-Qahtani, an Al-Qa’ida leader in Saudi Arabia has reputedly called for Al-Qa’ida to leave Saudi Arabia and relocate inYemen). Militant\r\nIslamists from Somalia, some of whom are reportedly associated with the Islamic Courts Union and/or operate thiroughi Somali refugees, are also believed to\r\nbe present in Hadramout - Al Mukalla, as a major shipping port, straddles traditional seaborne smuggling routes (which include arms shipments) between\r\nEast Africa and the Middle East. In addition, a number of Yemenis are known to be engaged in radicalization and militant Jihadist operations in other\r\ncountries, such as Iraq and Afghanistan, some of whom have returned to Yemen where they have continued radicalization and/or militant jihadist activities.\r\n\r\n8.\tYemen is reportedly considered a safe haven due in part to the lack of effective state authority and control, and in part due to the lack of counterterrorism\r\nlegislation which criminalizes those engaged in planning, facilitating, and/or carrying out acts of terrorism, both in Yemen and abroad. Participation in jihad\r\nabroad, such as Afghanistan, resonates well with many Yemenis.\r\n\r\n9.\tAl-Qa’ida attacks have often been preceded by demands for the release of detained Al-Qa’ida members. Al-Qa’ida has announced its intention to attack\r\nforeigners (tourists) and oil and gas infrastructure, the lifeblood of the Yemeni economy, which has raised concerns regarding economic growthi and invest-\r\nment, the security of shipping routes, and the transit of oil through the Suez Canal. Such attacks are specifically designed to damage Yemen’s economic\r\nfoundations, thwart inward investment and job creation.\r\n\r\n10.\tYemeni authorities stand accused of failing to effectively tackle Al-Qa’ida (e.g. the early release of convicted terrorists, prisoner escapes, deal making etc.),\r\nand even of having links with Al-Qa’ida (Yemeni authorities stand accused of allowingAl-Qa’ida members to train pro-government paramilitaries engaged in\r\nconflict with Houthi Shia rebels in Saada Governate, North Yemen). In addition analysts point out the debt of gratitude that exists between the government\r\nand Islamic militants who fought with the government in the 1994 Civil War. Such hesitancy / complicity has damaged Yemen’s international relations with\r\na number of countries, including the US. Although the crackdown on Al-Qa’ida has been met with broader international approval, many remain sceptical\r\nof government motives and intentions.\r\n\r\n11.\tHadramout Governate roughly incorporates the former territory of the Qu’aiti and Kathiri Sultanates, both of which were British protectorates in the Aden\r\nProtectorate until their abolition upon the independence of South Yemen in 1967.\r\n\r\n12.2007 Census projection.\r\n\r\n13.2004\r\n\r\n14.\tSource:Yemen Poverty Assessment 2007 (http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTYEMEN/Resources/3i0077-ll9720677l664/VolumeJ_Main_Report.\r\npdf).\r\n\r\n15.\tOil production in Yemen has peaked and is expected to be depleted in the coming years.

Perceptions of what constitutes a tribe, sub-tribe etc. vary.\r\n\r\n19.\tA basic example of such stratification is the divide that exists between Sadah, who are reputed to be descendants of the Prophet Muhammad and gener-\r\nally have more power and status in society, as opposed to non-Sadah, who have a significantly lower status. Hadhrami society has traditionally been divided\r\nbetween two basic but contradictory forces - those who stand for the status quo (often Sadah) and those who advocate for social change and reform (often\r\nMasakin). Such social divisions have been particularly evident during times of conflict and social upheaval, such as the Yemeni Revolution which pitted pro\r\nand anti-Republican groups against each other.\r\n\r\n20.\tSocial stratification is exhibited in many forms, such as forms of address (e.g. Sadah are often referred to as habib meaning beloved), in shaking hands, in\r\nseating arrangements, in marriage - males cannot marry females who belong to higher social groups etc. Note that political developments, socio-economic\r\n\r\nmodernization, and a deeper participation in the ideology and economy of the wider Arab world, are undermining traditional tribal and social power\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\n21.\tA sheikh is a leader of a tribal unit.

    "brochure_text": "How to Win Back the Mexican Election\n\nThe Mexican presidential election is set to take place this July and all signs point to a victory for veteran politician Andrés Manuel López Obrador. However, this election is not really one for Obrador to win—it is for the other candidates to lose. By using ineffective campaign techniques and strategies, opposition candidates and their parties are contributing to both Obrador’s success and their own demise. With some quick action and modifications to their strategies, campaigns still have a chance to turn things around.\n\nThe major political parties wield massive political hammers meant to shape Mexican voters’ perceptions. They try to influence voters through colorful campaign slogans, micro-targeting, and trendy commercials. The 2018 Mexican elections, however, are quite different. Mexican voters are politically motivated, very sophisticated, and not fooled by traditional campaign activities. They are actively engaged in political discussions and frequently leverage social media to share their own messages and shape online conversations.\n\nThe official campaign has not yet begun but Mexico’s behemoth political machines are already employing traditional political maneuvers. Alliance-building, digital marketing, and negative advertisements are already in full swing. The National Action Party (PAN), Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), and Citizens’ Movement (MC) recently formed a political alliance. The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Partido Verde Ecologista de México (PVEM), and New Alliance Party (PANAL) followed suit and will announce in the next couple weeks that independent candidate Margarita Zavala will also join their coalition.\n\nUnfortunately, alliance-building has proven to be ineffective in this campaign. Rather than increasing popularity for individual candidates and influence for the political parties, it is having the opposite effect. Negative public perception of PVEM grew from 38% in October 2017 to 76% in January 2018 based on the PVEM alliance with PRI. It increased again when PANAL joined the coalition, climbing to 88% in mid-January.\n\nIn the 2018 elections, political campaigns that rely on traditional techniques to win votes will not succeed. Campaigns need a new approach that starts with a different strategy. Campaigns that want to shape voter beliefs and perceptions, should view voters as screws that require finesse to persuade, not nails that are pounded into submission. Campaign strategies that incorporate a two-way dialogue and personalized engagements are critical to ensure support at the ballot.\n\nUnfortunately, candidates continue to rely on political experts and campaign teams as their primary source of information for decision-making. They spend millions of dollars to convince voters that their approach, policies, and actions would be the best for the country. However, it’s not campaign teams who are shaping the political discourse and the electorate’s perceptions on the candidates, political parties, and key topics (e.g., corruption, economy, and security). It is individuals.\n\n“The #PRI plays dirty even to their own party #TodosPorMexico is a coalition equal to #RoboPorMexico and no longer has a solution #NiUnVotoAlPRI.”\n\nA philosophical shift away from traditional strategies of continuously forcing political messages from campaign team to voters is required to win elections. Campaigns need to get out of their own “echo chambers,” made up of out-of-touch elites and self-proclaimed political experts, who tell candidates only what they want to hear. Instead, campaigns should turn the microphone away from their own “circle of friends” and face it toward the voices that really matter: the people.\n\nA campaign strategy based on the will of the people and not political will is the change needed, not only to find electoral success, but to build trust. It provides candidates a way to listen to the population and better understand constituents’ concerns, grievances, and hope for the future. It enables candidates to directly engage with voters on a personal level concerning issues that people care about most. And when they are elected, it allows them to stay connected with constituents in order to remain effective public stewards.\n\nThe 2018 Mexican election is not about having the loudest sound bite, the most expensive campaign, or the biggest alliance. It is about how well candidates listen to peoples’ voices, address their concerns, and deliver on the promise of a better future. In this election, as in all elections, the campaign that wins will be the one that connects with the people, not in the ways campaign teams advise, but in the ways the people themselves demand.",

Check out our white paper.What is SurveyExtender?The basic idea behind surveys is 120 years old: To get a response, a person has to answer your questions. This is both expensive and time consuming. Not surprisingly, most surveys don't have many respondents. And those that do, are astronomically expensive.Yet we know that surveys with few respondents usually do not accurately reflect the population. So survey researchers are typically left with poor quality data and poor quality answers. To date, this has been acceptable because no better alternative existed. SurveyExtender changes this. It's built on the idea that we can forecast how hundreds of thousands of people would respond to a survey without actually needing them to take the survey. This idea is provocative and a major shift in how we think about doing survey research. We have spent the last few years figuring out how to do it, and building a rigorous science to validate the method and give us the confidence that this is the way to do survey research.The result: We take your survey of 1,000 respondents and give you back responses for over 100,000 anonymous respondents across the United States. Survey Extender works by using state-of-the-art machine learning technology that automatically builds models predicting responses to your survey questions using people's a special survey of demographic and psychological questions.The rest of this page shares in detail the scientific validation of SurveyExtender and the basic principles of how it functions. We are ultimately skeptical scientists and have worked hard to convince ourselves that survey forecasting works. We hope you find our evidence convincing. But the best way to actually see if it works is to test it yourself. Run a survey, have it extended, and play with the results.Basics Behind Survey ForecastingSurveyExtender works by (a) taking a sample of participants (at least 1000) who have answered your survey and a special \"Rosetta Stone\" survey of ours, (b) uses machine learning to build models of how the \"Rosetta Stone\" survey maps onto your responses, and then (c) feeds through the \"Rosetta Stone\" survey responses of 100,000+ anonymous people through these models to generate forecasts for how they might answer your survey.  Below we discuss each step in detail.Step 1: Your Survey + Social Media from 1000 respondentsFor SurveyExtender to work, it will need data to build its machine learning models. This data has two parts: (a) Responses to your survey (which will be used as the output), and (b) A special all of our participants take which we call the \"Rosetta Stone\" survey (which will be used as the input).  Philometrics makes it easy to get both parts of the data. Simply build your survey using our survey engine and then turn SurveyExtender on in the study settings (or when creating the study). We will automatically add the necessary questions to the beginning of your study to collect the \"Rosetta Stone\" survey. Once you have your survey ready, simply recruit at least 1000 people to do your survey. We need at least 1000 people to answer each question to ensure the models have high enough accuracy rates. For best results, we recommend recruiting even more--1500 to 2000 respondents.Step 2: Automatically Building ModelsOnce you have collected at least 1000 participants who have both (a) Responses to your survey and (b) the \"Rosetta Stone\" survey, SurveyExtender applies machine learning algorithms to build a model for every question that is either continuous (likert, slider) or categorical (multiple choice, drop down, checkbox) in nature. The models take the \"Rosetta Stone\" survey responses  as inputs--the Xs in a regression. Then they set each survey question as the output--the Y in a regression.Step 3: ForecastOnce the models are ready, we feed the \"Rosetta Stone\" survey data of  over 100,000 anonymous people through the models. This generates a forecast for each person how they might respond to each survey question. This forecast is based on each person's psychology and demographics behavior.To learn more about the logic behind why this works--and why it provides better results than just surveys--keep reading!The Need for Large SamplesResearch is about generalizing: We want to take something we've learned about our participants and generalize the insight to the broader population. This has been historically difficult to do without a very large number of participants. Let’s take an example: Imagine you want to conduct a political poll. You recruit 1000 Americans and ask them their political preferences. In the best case scenario, this sample is nationally representative.What you can confidently learn from these 1000 people is how on average, Americans are leaning in their political preferences. However, this is a national level snapshot, and misses much of the rich differences that exist between states. So now let’s imagine you want to go deeper and ask what are people's political preferences in each state. The 1000 participants provide poor answers to this question because you have very few people from each state - smaller states, such as Vermont, may not even have a single person represented in your 1000 participants. You quickly run into the small N problem: Too few participant data points on the population (each state's voters) you are trying to generalize about.To get a good estimate by state, you would need to go out and get 1000 participants in each state, quickly ballooning the sample size to 50,000. The problem only escalates further as you zoom in deeper (say to the district level) or start comparing different groups within states (say men versus women, or younger versus older voters).We've never had a good solution to this problem other than to go recruit massive samples - something that has been prohibitively expensive and thus rarely done. For the most part, we've simply been unable to explore the rich variability we know is there, but simply cannot access.This problem stems from us being bound by a simple rule: The only way we can access how people respond to surveys is by asking them, and so our sample size is equal to how many people we recruit. Philometrics aims to change this through SurveyExtender.How Survey Forecasting WorksLet's start with a relatively uncontroversial (we hope!) claim: All of human behavior is driven by what's going on in our heads and the social environments we live in. If we could understand perfectly how a person thinks and the environment they are in, then we should be able to predict how they would answer a survey (which is just a form of behavior).Survey forecasting is based on this principle - but it’s far more approximate than the ideal case. We first say let’s ignore the social environment and just figure out how a person thinks. This would get us quite far as it would remove some of the situational biases that often occur in our surveys (though potentially limit our ability to understand the role of situational forces in shaping behavior). Then, we try to figure out an approximation of what’s going on in their heads by using a questionnaire designed to estimate their personal psychology.But people are extremely complex and our \"Rosetta Stone\" survey is unlikely to capture this richness fully. So the information we extract os imperfect: It is only a rough approximation of a person. At the same time, the information does carry some level of insight about the person.What we would expect then is for the \"Rosetta Stone\" survey data to be able to provide us rough approximations of how people think - and in turn, how they answer surveys. These should be rough with lots of noise.Accuracy of Forecasted DataHow do we know our models and forecasts are any good? To answer this, we test all the models using people who were not part of the training process (so their data in no way shaped what the model looks like), but have both actual survey responses and our \"Rosetta Stone\" survey responses. We take these people's \"Rosetta Stone\" survey responses, feed them into our models, and generate forecasted survey responses. We then compare these forecasted survey responses to their actual responses.There are two typical accuracy metrics. For continuous variables (e.g., Likert responses, slider responses, age), we simply correlate the forecasted response with the actual response. For categorical variables, we use Area Under the Curve (or AUC), which is a measure of the percentage of time you would accurately classify a person as being part of a category assuming that you had equal number of folks part of that category and not part of that category (so complete guessing should lead to a 50% success rate). The AUC number ranges from 0 to 1, with .5 being the chance guessing level and 1 meaning you classified every person correctly.In our system, we do the training and testing using the participants that actually complete your survey. For all these participants, we collect the \"Rosetta Stone\" survey responses behind the scenes. Since the sample sizes are relatively small, we use resampling techniques to generate the test group. The ultimate result though is a model for every question you asked that can be used to forecast. For each model, we tell you the accuracy rates using either R (correlation for continuous variables) or AUC (for categorical variables).The building model part is only step 1. The really exciting bit happens next: We take 100,000+ real people, we feed their \"Rosetta Stone\" survey responses through the models to forecast the best guess of how they would have answered your survey. These scores are noisy - in no way are they actually spot on in forecasting how a particular individual would actually respond. But they are better than chance, and far more importantly, they have several properties that make using them to generalize to the original population extremely powerful - in fact, far more powerful than using the self-report! Keep reading to find out how this happens and how we validate this claim.How Do Biased Samples Affect Forecasted Scores?In working with survey forecasting, we discovered two very important properties of forecasted scores. First, we found that even though the scores had a lot of noise, they were unbiased: Our models are just as likely to over-predict as under-predict a person's score.The mean of the errors is nearly 0 and there's roughly a normal distribution around the 0 point. This is extremely important as it tells us our models are not making systematically wrong forecasts. Now this is where the power of a large sample comes in. If these were actual survey responses, and we were attempting to get an average for the population they came from, we would average the survey responses and get a pretty great estimate of the true population average: This is because with a large sample, and assuming there is no systematic bias in people's scores, the average across all people is close to the true average. In the case of forecasted scores, if we take a large group of people with forecasted scores and average them together, our average error becomes nearly 0 and we get a population average that should be very close to the truth.What is amazing here is that since we can forecast for many more people than in our original training sample, we can get far better population averages from the forecasted data than the actual survey responses we collected! Think back to our political poll example. If we had surveyed 1000 people, there would be too few data points per state to say anything meaningful about the average in the smaller states. But through forecasting, we now have estimates for 100,000+ anonymous people - plenty of data points per state. And since the forecasts are unbiased, when averaging them together, we should get pretty close to the true state average (e.g., what we would have found if we had surveyed everyone in each state).The second important property of forecasted responses is that they tend to correlate with each other sensibly. If you take a correlation matrix of actual survey responses and compare it to a correlational matrix of the same variables, but forecasted, the correlation matrixes are often quite similar. The directions of the correlations are almost always the same, with the only difference being magnitude. We are continuing to work on making the models even better and making the correlation matrixes as similar to the self-report as possible, but already it’s quite good. Why this is important is that ultimately, we often care about two things in our surveys: Population averages and how variables covary with one another. We've already covered the high accuracy at the population average from the forecasted responses; the correlation matrix similarity property provides shows us that forecasted data is also highly useful for understanding relationships.IntroductionBasics Behind Survey ForecastingThe Need for Large SamplesHow Survey Forecasting WorksAccuracy of Forecasted DataHow Do Biased Samples Affect Forecasted Scores?2015-2017 Philometrics Inc.

Cambridge Analytica comScore’s Television Information to Achieve Better Television Buying for Political and Commercial Clients RESTON, VA, October 12, 2016 – comScore (NASDAQ: SCOR) today announced an agreement with Cambridge Analytica, which will use comScore’s television information as a component of TV campaign strategies for political and commercial advertising clients.With the new agreement, Cambridge Analytica will merge its behavioral psychology and data analytics platform with comScore’s television measurement for media planning, buying and return on media investment research. comScore’s Advanced Demographics will provide Cambridge Analytica with insights into which programs, stations and dayparts deliver the highest densities of the targeted audiences that the company’s clients seek to influence.By utilizing comScore’s television service, Cambridge Analytica’s clients will be able to send the right commercial messages, to the right people, in the right place at the right time, making TV advertising campaigns more efficient and effective.“For years, the television industry used advertising targets that comprised demographics instead of actual product purchase or voter registration information because it was not available, resulting in wasted advertising dollars and imprecise ad targeting,” said Cambridge Analytica’s Head of TV, Ed DeNicola. “Our alliance with comScore takes television ad-targeting to a new level, which not only includes better targeting, but also messaging.” \nAbout Cambridge AnalyticaCambridge Analytica, the U.S. affiliate of SCL Group,

In August 2017, Salesforce announced that it had breached the $10 billion revenue run rate becoming the first enterprise cloud company to do so.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thttps://www.salesforce.com/\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n        \n                                                        \n\t\t\n        \t\t\t\n            \n\n   \n\t\t\t\n            \n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tRelated Products \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalidated Campaign Essentials\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t                    \n\t\t\t\t                     \n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSegment\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nSegment is the infrastructure for customer data.

Ahí dio 42.7% a AMLO --que sube ligeramente contra la medición de marzo-- y 28.8% a Anaya, que es quien más ascendió.\nConcedió 21% a Meade (el candidato que más descendió) y ubicó en 4.9% a Zavala, que bajó considerablemente. El Bronco tiene 2.6%, con un ligero descenso.\n\nSi observamos la tendencia, AMLO mantiene su ventaja sobre Anaya, quien evidentemente se vio afectado por el caso que expuso la PGR, lo que detuvo su crecimiento. También vemos a  Meade con una evidente tendencia a la baja; el mismo caso que Margarita y en cuanto al Bronco su inclusión en la boleta no causó ningún efecto evidente.\nAhora bien, en la actividad pública en redes sociales tomamos como fuente a metrics.digital que reporta las conversaciones relacionadas con los candidatos en tiempo real. Para el efecto de este análisis hicimos el corte de una semana, el cual se hizo el viernes (20 de abril) por la noche. En las mediciones AMLO tiene 34.5% de las conversaciones, Anaya el 14.7%, Meade el 30.6%, Zavala el 10.7% y El Bronco 9.5%.\nEs importante mencionar que esto se refiere solo a la actividad relacionada con la opinión pública, eliminamos todo el “ruido digital”, lo que significa que quitamos el impacto de la conversación elaborada con bots, trolls y medios, que representan aproximadamente el 35% de la actividad social.\n\nLos candidatos con más negativos son Meade, con 18.4% y AMLO con 15.9% que es casi el doble de sus positivos; los que tienen más positivos son Anaya con 11.5%, y Zavala con 9.5%, siendo esta última la que tiene una mayor proporción de positivos contra negativos. Es importante acotar que entre más actividad social registran los candidatos la probabilidad de que tenga más negativos es mayor, ya que la conversación se relaciona con hechos coyunturales que generan discusión en redes sociales.\nEn los resultados de google.com/trends, que reporta las búsquedas que realizaron los usuarios en Google durante la última semana, AMLO se lleva el 63.5%, Anaya el 9.5%, Meade el 18.9%, Zavala el 5.4% y El Bronco 2.7%. En un análisis más profundo establecimos las principales búsquedas relacionadas con cada candidato.\n\nLa gente está investigando sobre temas como la avioneta que usó AMLO, la encuesta que publicó Reforma en la semana y la tendencia que comenzó en Twitter #UniversitariosConAMLO en apoyo al tabasqueño. Los usuarios con interés en Anaya están buscando información de encuestas y aparentemente quieren saber cuál es la diferencia porcentual entre AMLO y Anaya. \nLas búsquedas relacionadas con Meade se enfocan principalmente en los rumores relacionados con su renuncia y la anexión de Ríos Piter a su campaña. En el caso de Zavala, los usuarios se concentran en el tropezón que tuvo cuando habló sobre la gasolina. Al Bronco solo lo buscan en relación con los otros candidatos.\nEstamos acostumbrados a que durante y después del debate todos los candidatos muevan sus ejércitos digitales y analógicos para declararse ganadores. No sabemos qué sucederá, pero hay gran expectativa, ya que es el debate más importante de la historia para AMLO. Aunque cada candidato presentará su propia estrategia, de este evento depende el futuro de las cinco campañas: todos intentarán hacer lo necesario para bajar a López Obrador.\nEn el caso de Anaya buscará que la carrera sea claramente entre dos; Meade se juega su última carta para escalar al segundo lugar y en el caso de los independientes es su oportunidad para que la gente los considere como candidatos viables. \nLa realidad es que las campañas están hechas de coyunturas y ocurrencias que aprovechan o no los candidatos. Veremos quién sale mejor librado. La próxima semana estaremos midiendo el impacto de debate usando las mismas herramientas, índices y métricas.\nJavier Murillo Acuña\nFundador y Presidente del Consejo de Metrics\nhttps://www.twitter.com/JavierMurillo\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/javiermurilloacuna/\nwww.metrics.digital\n \n                    \n                \t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tÚltimas publicaciones\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tSección de Ximena Céspedes #ControlDeCrisis Por El Financiero 1/06/18\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tLeer Mas »\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tJavier Murillo en la sección #YoBot por El Financiero 29/05/18\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tJavier Murillo con María Scherer con el tema: Análisis Digital de las Elecciones en México.

While traditional survey methods are plagued by high costs and low response rates, Pinpoint offers campaigns a better option. The tool inserts a horserace question or a Likert Scale into a 30 second video ad targeted to the exact universe of desired respondents. If a user opts to answer the question, they are able to skip the 30 second ad slot and return to their content. This immediate benefit to the users allows us to achieve response rates upwards of 10% at a small marginal increase to the cost of running the ad campaign itself.",

We dreamt of it and we did it with “En Marche !” in spring 2016.\n\nThe stakes were high, we had to :\n\nRecruit an army of volunteers and train them in doorknocking techniques\n\nIdentify key neighbourhoods to make sure that the responses gained were representative\n\nEquip activists with a mobile app so that they could input responses to the questionnaire\n\nProcess the tens of thousands of reponses and summarise them through natural language processing methods\n\nThe Grande Marche provided the momentum for Emmanuel Macron’s movement “En Marche !” It made it possible for them to recruit a team of passionate activists who then became essential during the presidential election. In numbers the Grande Marche consisted of 10,000 activists, 300,000 doors knocked, and 25,000 questionnaires filled.",

ElectionBase is an essential campaign planning and budgeting tool as well as a key targeting resource for political professionals. ElectionBase reveals what it takes to win and provides powerful insights into the electorate.\n\nElectionBase is the most refined election history database on the market, with detailed election results available at the precinct level for elections dating back to 2010.\n\nElectionBase provides insight into previous elections, helping campaigns and organizations analyze trends and guide their decision-making process when targeting particular voters or geographies.\n\nElectionBase serves as a great tool for companies and academic institutions that strive to better understand voting trends in the United States.\n\nElectionBase is entirely matched to VoterBase at the individual level, making it unique in its ability to provide a level of targeting previously unavailable to many campaigns.\n\nMore Info About ElectionBase\n\nSourcing\n\nTargetSmart sources its election results data directly from state and county election authorities, and then matches those results to VoterBase, our national voter file. The merger of voter and election result data creates a vital campaign tool.\n\nBy the numbers:\n\n170,000 – Number of precincts reporting for the 2012 & 2014 elections.\n\n30 – Number of different types of candidate election results collected at the presidential, statewide, congressional, state legislative, and local level.\n\n160 – Number of different ballot initiatives, referendums, and amendment elections collected and standardized at the precinct level nationwide.\n\n7,000,000 – Number of census blocks the election results in which ElectionBase has intelligently disaggregated the votes to provide a highly accurate snapshot of past elections, even as political geographies and the electorate change over time.\n\n8,000,000 – Number of ‘drop-off’ voters* *Voters who vote at the top of the ballot (i.e. – presidential election) but do not vote on state or local candidates or issues.\n\nData Quality\n\nPrecincts change. Voters move around the country. These are two key challenges in building an accurate snapshot of election results over time. But TargetSmart’s unique process establishes a clear and consistent view of election outcomes and overcomes these challenges.\n\nPrecinct Changes – By integrating the election results with our voter database build process, we are able to monitor and maintain accurate precinct results, even as precincts change and new precincts are established.\n\nMovers – With more than 45 million residential address changes each year, the electorate looks vastly different today than it did in the past. By tracking these movers and connecting their votes to their records, we are able to create a more accurate view of how they will vote in the next election. Because we maintain a current address for the vast majority of those voters, we are also able to also carry along their election results.\n\nTargeting\n\nElection results are published at the precinct level, but elections are held at different geographic levels. TargetSmart ‘s revolutionary process disaggregates precinct-level election results and assigns votes cast at an individual voter level. This approach allows us to create highly accurate aggregates of election results – at any geography.\n\nElectionBase is the only geographic election database presented on current electoral geographies. That means we can take historic election results and match them to our clients’ current precinct boundaries.\n\nVisualizations\n\nOften times, the best way to present data is visually. With our data visualization toolset, we’ve combined our election base, voter base and other geographic data sets into interactive custom dashboards. Clients are able to view election results at all kinds of geographic levels around the country.\n\nRedistricting\n\nElectionBase data is critical for redistricting and reapportionment. It is more accurate and more comprehensive than any data ever used for this process. ElectionBase is disaggregated to the census block level and ready-made for census data. As soon as the Census Bureau publishes the next PL94 dataset, we are able to match historic election results with new boundaries nearly instantaneously.",

This single, consistent, consumer view enables us to:\n\nRecognize people over time, even as they move around the country, change their last name, or use a nickname.\n\nOvercome significant issues with data quality, including misspellings and missing data.\n\nMatch people from disparate data sources (lists) with a high degree of confidence and accuracy.\n\nAddress Enhancement\n\nIn addition to being an invaluable tool for list matching within and across data sets, ExactTrack also enables address enhancement by comparing the accuracy of the address that was input to the system against the address that exists in the ExactTrack database. If the ExactTrack address for a matched record is more complete or more deliverable (according to the postal service), then ExactTrack will return the address from its database and augment the accuracy of the address submitted.\n\nFor example, assume that Bill Smith at 123 Main Street was matched from an input list. ExactTrack also has a Bill Smith at 123 Main Street; however, we have Bill Smith at 123 Main Street, Apartment A3. This slight change in detail can impact the ability to effectively communicate with Bill Smith, and the ability to match his record to other databases.\n\nChange of Address\n\nIn addition to enhancing existing addresses, ExactTrack also provides more current addresses by leveraging a ‘move-in’ date on its historic occupant database. National Change of Address is still the preferred change of address source. However, ExactTrack also provides a powerful, supplemental change of address service to identify changes of address. It can be used for a variety of purposes, including the reactivation of lapsed clients or inquirers, identifying potential new addresses for individuals whose addresses appear undeliverable, and many others.",

    "brochure_title": "March for Racial Justice",
    "brochure_text": "Background The March for Racial Justice (M4RJ) came to us with a story of love, loss, and grassroots resistance. We were convinced this was a story that would enrich the national dialogue on race relations and mobilize the masses to take action-- all they needed was the right messaging strategy. We started our work with just over a month until the march and sixteen sister marches. The M4RJ’s dedicated leaders had managed some preview coverage, but were at capacity working full time jobs in addition to planning the march. We were happy to dive in and support their efforts with a comprehensive storytelling strategy to effectively communicate their mission, spark engagement across their social media channels, and contribute to the success of their crowdfunding campaign.\n\nThe March for Racial Justice called for all hands on deck. We were excited to engage multiple departments and provide full-service support for M4RJ. With every variable of our comprehensive digital storytelling strategy — from social media to mobile to public relations — we asked ourselves: How does this help tell the story of the march?\n\nIn our exploratory conversation with the organizers, we established the importance of this story being told by black and indigenous voices leading the charge and were able to cement the march’s vision into consistent topline messaging. After an extensive surveying of the media landscape, we helped identify press targets and social media influencers who would help amplify the march and stay true to its narrative.\n\nWe worked to position the M4RJ organizers as thought leaders through a series of op-eds that shared their firsthand testimony in response to relevant headlines and offered original content to share across social media channels. With placements in VICE Impact and Essence, we were able to speak to audiences that would be receptive to march’s call to action and engage in more targeted press outreach for a week by week build-up to the big day. Using the public relations team’s rolodexes and databases — and good old fashioned cold call pitches — we coordinated with major press outlets, securing preview interviews with the Washington Post, C-SPAN, CNN, The Progressive, and Al Jazeera. Additionally, we worked closely with principals to book interviews onsite always working to ensure they felt prepared and polished.\n\nAuthentic storytelling and message development\n\nWhile our work on M4RJ was rooted in digital strategy, developing messaging and tools for distributed organizing was essential in bringing the event to life. Using the original messaging and content, we developed a press kit which packaged together media logistics and materials offering context for the march’s mission and founding. We turned the national press kit into a template for sister march organizers and community partners to adapt for their local press needs. Beyond establishing a consistent narrative, it offered reporters enough content for preliminary coverage of the march and supported organizers in their local press outreach.\n\nLeading up to the actual march, we coordinated with vendors to develop a comprehensive plan for our on-site logistical support. From registering press and accommodating their day-of needs to working with high profile guest speakers, our team became an extension of the organizers and volunteers. Our staff was briefed and trained for rapid response, provided experienced advance support throughout the set up on the National Mall, and coordinated social media coverage throughout the day. We were proud to have ten of our staff at various stations and even more joining the marchers.\n\nTapping into mobile organizing technology\n\nM4RJ asked for a way to continue communicating with its audience long after the marches were over. We devised a mobile texting program to capture names, zip codes and emails for future engagement as well as garner donations to help offset the costs of the march.\n\nWe encouraged people to text the keyword JUSTICE to the shortcode, 228466, in radio and television interviews, on social media and through the speakers at the march itself. 781 people texted JUSTICE and 544 of them gave us their email – a 69.2% rate. 61.3% of the subscribers clicked on link to donate – a very high action rate!\n\nCommunity engagement on social media\n\nThe social media strategy for the M4RJ relied heavily on storytelling to educate its audience. Each week leading up to the march followed a theme including awareness, reflection, radical love and inspiration. The social media posts aimed at acknowledging past and present racial injustice issues from the perspective of various racial and ethnic groups.\n\nOn the day of the march, we turned over the storytelling reins to the attendees. Our team did on-site mini interviews with attendees asking one simple question: “Why are you marching?” The messages from the attendees reflected and underscored the messaging we’d been promoting in the weeks leading up to the march. With a personal face on the message, these posts garnered the most engagement.",

    "brochure_title": "Daily Action Case Study",
    "brochure_text": "Background In the wake of the election, millions of stunned Americans felt impotence and despair. One was Laura Moser, a thirty nine-year-old mom who decided to turn those feelings of frustration into Daily Action.\n\nThe idea is simple: every day, subscribers to Daily Action receive a brief text message telling them about one quick action. They press the phone number in the SMS text, listen to a short message about the action they’ll be taking, and from there are routed to their member of Congress, a government agency, a business or someone we think needs to hear from Daily Action. It’s quick, it’s easy, it’s effective—and it’s growing exponentially.\n\nDaily Action follows the news cycles closely to determine where we can collectively make the greatest impact, and organize one action every workday to make our voices heard loud and clear. The point is to remove the hurdles from civic engagement.\n\nThe movement is powered by Revolution Messaging’s Revere Platform, using Calling, Mobile, Direction and Landing technology to mobilize progressive activists against Trump and the extreme Republican Congress. Our creative team developed the logo and brand to exemplify the urgency and efficacy of the movement.\n\nDaily Action has emerged as a source for people to learn—in quick, easily digestible talking points—about the daily news cycle. Before being connected to the day’s target contact, callers listen to a brief recorded message describing that day’s issue.

    "brochure_title": "Bernie 2016 Case Study - Revolution Messaging",
    "brochure_text": "Background Building a movement online In the spring of 2015, before the campaign launched, we knew Bernie Sanders was a leader who stood on the right side of history. But Bernie was polling around 3 percent, had no establishment support, little name recognition and was running against a popular and “inevitable” Democratic primary opponent. We had our work cut out for us. With no offline fundraising team, no Super PAC, and no Wall Street money, we would have to raise almost all of the campaign’s money from small-dollar donations.\n\n\n\nWe were up for the challenge, because we knew this had the potential to be a historic campaign. We had just 72 hours to create a digital and branding strategy for the launch, including a website, email and fundraising program and digital advertising strategy. Within 24 hours of Bernie‘s announcement, we raised over $1.5 million. More than 100,000 people signed up to join the campaign and 35,000 of those people made donations.\n\nRecord-Breaking Online Fundraising\n\nWhen we started working on Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, we didn’t know how much money we could raise online from small-dollar donors. About a week before the campaign launched, we projected somewhere between $30 to $50 million online if he ran a credible campaign that lasted through Iowa. But after 30,000 people contributed almost $1.5 million in the first 24 hours, we knew the campaign had a chance to make history.\n\nFrom the start, Senator Sanders told us he wanted his campaign to be about the issues, and that the digital fundraising effort should reflect that. He made it clear that our job was to inspire people to participate because of the values we share, not scare them into giving because of an opponent they fear.\n\nThroughout the campaign, we were creative and timely with our approach and data-driven with our decisions. From emails to ads, to the homepage to contribution pages and everything in-between, we rigorously tested and optimized to maximize our returns. But the common thread was a focus on substance and the goal of connecting with supporters directly about the issues.\n\nThe campaign raised $218 million online, almost exclusively from small-dollar donors giving an average of $27 at a time.\n\nThe Sanders campaign received more contributions in a presidential primary than any candidate ever, and more than Obama received in 2008 in full. Senator Sanders’ message inspired record-breaking participation from small-dollar donors. Every single team within Revolution Messaging — email, ads, development, creative, and mobile — had a hand in proving that if you are willing to speak to the issues important to the American people and put forth a solid digital effort, you can run a competitive campaign for any office in the country.\n\nA Revolution in Campaign Art and Culture\n\nBehind our work with the Sanders campaign is a commitment to powerful political graphics and video. Behind-the-scenes video releases comprise an archive of gritty humanity to followers who hunger for authenticity. Photography that opts out of digital sleekness in the iPhone age sends a message about a new kind of politics; one that breaks with “best practices” to embrace the flaws of reality and tells the true story of a 74-year-old Jewish democratic socialist from Vermont challenging history’s most powerful non-incumbent opponent for the nomination.\n\nThe distinct visual identity of our graphic design, videos, banner ads, and shareables allowed us to hold a microphone to Bernie’s message across increasingly horizontal and democratized social media platforms. The Senator himself favored an engaging narrative style that won us over with 8-minute videos and lengthy emails that saw engagement rates go through the roof. This includes a nearly 2,500-word fundraising email and a long direct-to-camera video on income inequality, which received more than 7 million views on Facebook.\n\nOur embedded video team created more than 550 unique videos for the campaign. By June 2016, Sanders’ 557 videos had reached over 42 million views on Facebook alone.\n\nRevolution Messaging co-founded Artists for Bernie, an organization for musicians and artists who #FeelTheBern. These celebrities and opinion leaders signed an online endorsement letter and contributed their time by doing event appearances, knocking on doors in battleground states, filming videos for the campaign to use, tweeting their support, and even making ice cream for us to raffle off (thanks Ben and Jerry!). Our team produced concerts, earned media events and unannounced live acoustic performances for over a dozen members of Artists for Bernie looking to share their support of the senator. Artists for Bernie recruited more than 200 critically acclaimed artists and musicians who pitched in to give voice to the revolution.\n\nRewriting the Advertising Playbook\n\nThe Sanders campaign spent more on digital advertising than all federal races combined in 2008. And with good reason. Since Bernie had never run for office nationally, he started at a significant disadvantage in terms of name recognition, familiarity with his positions and the size of his supporter list. With Bernie‘s digital advertising placements, we were able to quickly and cost-effectively assist in record-breaking fundraising, grow Bernie‘s base, persuade key targets, and turn out voters. Our strategy was to focus our early advertising efforts on digital, connect with voters early and often, mobilize online quickly during key moments, experiment frequently, and not overcomplicate our message or tactics.\n\nThe key, especially in the first months of our campaign, was focusing on what worked best. For example, in the early days of Bernie’s candidacy, many journalists and insiders were quick to write him off. The press argued that Bernie’s attempt to put the focus on certain issues was futile. So, we targeted the millions of progressives who cared about those issues most. Those same people were targeted with ads encouraging them to join Bernie‘s rallies, which built the foundation for what would become a political phenomenon.\n\nThe campaign raised more than $61 million and acquired more than three million email addresses from digital ads.\n\nThe campaign was marked by many firsts in the political advertising space. We were the first Presidential campaign to employ Facebook Canvas ads, Twitter conversational video ads and YouTube bumper ads. The campaign ran the first-ever political takeover on the homepage of the New York Times. Bernie Sanders was also the first presidential candidate to employ sponsored content with publishers like Buzzfeed, The Hill and Politico.\n\nWe placed a series of Snapchat filter ads for the nine days leading up to, and including, the Iowa caucus. It was the first Snapchat ad placement for a Democratic candidate ever, and the first time Snapchat ran a geotargeted campaign for that many consecutive days. The series of filters featured a cartoon Bernie counting down the days to the caucus and asking Iowans if they were ready to “Feel the Bern.” The ads were viewed more than 3 million times.\n\nLeveraging Powerful Technology and Development\n\nWe were tasked with building the first iteration of BernieSanders.com just 72 hours before the launch of the campaign. And over the course of the next 15 months, the site was optimized and evolved into a hub that helped the campaign build an email list, drive contributions, empower supporters to organize as part of a massive distributed field effort, and educate voters about the senator’s decades of progressive work, driving the enthusiasm behind his campaign.\n\nThe homepage, BernieSanders.com, was constantly tested and optimized to maximize the number of people signing up to join the campaign. We adapted the site for high-leverage moments by creating a unique “splash contribute” homepage. The feature helped the campaign raise more than $7 million in 24 hours when Bernie held a “National Fundraiser” during his New Hampshire victory speech. Before the first debate, we built a splash “signup to contribute” page that raised $337 PER SECOND in the first 30 minutes after the debate.\n\nRevolution Messaging built an online store that stayed true to Senator Sanders’ vision for America. Every item was made in America, and came with a guarantee that every printer and fulfillment worker received a liveable wage. By designing the merchandise in-house, controlling the online store web interface and working with our own ads team, we were able to quickly produce small batches of limited-edition merchandise – and quickly sell out of each item. We sold more than $15 million of online merchandise in just a few short months.\n\n42% of all contributions came from a mobile phone.\n\nThe Bernie 2016 mobile program, powered by Revere Mobile, took off with enormous and rapid list growth from day one. The first large event was Bernie’s Organizing Kickoff, where more than 3,000 house parties and more than 100,000 attendees across the country tuned in to a livestream in which the digital organizing director told everyone to text WORK to 82623 to join an organizing team and volunteer. Within a few hours almost half of the attendees of the house parties had joined the Bernie 2016 mobile list. Throughout the campaign, the average monthly list growth was 77 percent with significant spikes during pushes for voter outreach.\n\nWe launched the first ever text-to-donate technology to leverage donor support during big moments. First, our team launched an integration with ActBlue Express, empowering individuals to text a keyword to donate $20 using their ActBlue account. Three weeks later we announced seamless donations via a user’s phone bill.\n\nContact Us to Start Your Revolution",

    "brochure_title": "UltraViolet Case Study - Revolution Messaging",
    "brochure_text": "Outcome UltraViolet sees big wins year after year\n\nUltraViolet’s success is not the result of a fluke, a supposed viral marketing campaign, or a high budget corporate rollout. It is the product of a small group of people working together to thoroughly craft visual messaging for millions with a tight budget and demanding timeline.\n\nWhen UltraViolet and their supporters were outraged by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell’s apathy toward domestic abuse cases, Revolution Messaging helped the public zero in on the commissioner’s failure to take domestic violence seriously. The subsequent #GoodellMustGo campaign deployed Revolution Messaging’s full arsenal, from creative graphics and video production to advertising and web development. A 15-second web clip at the campaign’s center garnered national attention as it depicted a uniformed football player tackling a standing woman without protective gear, sending a powerful message on the NFL’s domestic violence problem. The video sparked a firestorm of scrutiny and attention that led Sports Illustrated to play the ad on their website, helping to change the dominant narrative of domestic violence ahead of Super Bowl XLIX.\n\nUltraViolet also campaigned to support pop musician Kesha’s fight to be legally released from contractual obligations with a sexually and emotionally abusive producer. Revolution Messaging encouraged the public scrutiny of Sony and Dr. Luke to help the pop star by launching a geotargeted Snapchat filter, fenced around Sony’s headquarters in Manhattan during a “Free Kesha” rally. Despite the short run time and small area, this filter resulted in almost 10,000 views and received attention on other social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter.\n\nMarking the 40th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, Revolution Messaging produced a video with the help of comedian Lizz Winstead to highlight ongoing challenges women face as legislatures across the country ramp up restrictions on healthcare access. Up to bat once more, Lizz and the hilarious use of puppets helped us further UltraViolet’s message to the Supreme Court amidst the decision to conflate restrictions on contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act with an employer’s “personal religious freedom.”\n\nUltraViolet’s other campaigns to leverage social pressure against malevolent actors have been met with similar success, like their push for Reebok to drop Rick Ross following his pro-date-rape lyrics, and the removal of the Komen Foundation’s CEO Karen Handel over her role in defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nUltraViolet has found messaging applications both online and offline. A strong social media presence has catapulted the group since its inception in 2012, and the offline work has built a grassroots network of devoted members across the country. With a membership of nearly 750,000 and a Facebook following of more than 100,000, the group has blazed a new creative trail for online nonprofits to follow.\n\nLet’s Work Together",

    "brochure_title": "Know Your Charter Case Study - Revolution Messaging",
    "brochure_text": "Background Digital data hub demands accountability and transparency for a broken charter school system Even the biggest proponents of charter schools know Ohio’s charter schools are grossly underperforming, due largely to a lack of oversight. In 2013, Ohio public schools lost $900,500,253 in funding to charter schools. Nearly 400 charter schools operate in Ohio, but with less accountability than traditional public schools. Parents, educators and policymakers need to be able to see the comparative performance of charters, as well as their cost to local school districts.\n\nIn 2014, Ohio Education Association created Know Your Charter to combat misinformation and present the facts on charter schools across the state. Revolution Messaging became the digital partner for the project, providing web development, data analysis, digital advertising and email.\n\nThe heart of Know Your Charter is a data-rich website, KnowYourCharter.com. This responsive site was designed and developed to help Ohioans better understand how publicly funded charter schools are faring and how they compare to traditional public schools. KnowYourCharter.com provides analysis from a bevy of Ohio Department of Education school data. We provided an open-sourced library of scripts that parse, compile and prepare data for SQL import that can be viewed on GitHub for added credibility.\n\nVisitors to the site are invited to enter either their school district or a specific charter school to see the data. The resulting information can be staggering, revealing how often charter schools underperform despite receiving so much tax-payer funding at the expense of public schools.\n\nOur team developed a full digital strategy to promote the website, including email, digital advertising and creative for online display and mobile promotion. The message of all ads – targeted primarily to parents of young children – urged individuals to visit the site and compare the schools. The facts speak for themselves. Social media and high impact advertising played a prominent role in launching the site, featuring a series of local newspaper homepage takeovers. As a result, the shocking disparities between performance and funding were brought to light.\n\nLet’s Work Together",

    "brochure_text": "Background While Hollywood was celebrating its breathtakingly terrible track record of inclusion and diversity during the 88th Academy Awards ceremony on Sunday, February 28, another star-studded event focused on bringing justice to a community in crisis.\n\nBlackout for Human Rights teamed up with Revolution Messaging, ActBlue Charities and The Tides Foundation to organize a concert fundraiser to benefit those affected by the water contamination crisis in Flint, Michigan. The event was live streamed online via Revolt TV to thousands of viewers and included performances by Janelle Monae and Stevie Wonder.\n\nRevolution Messaging was honored to provide our SMS broadcast technology to the cause. Our Revere Mobile platform empowered attendees and viewers to effortlessly donate to the #JusticeForFlint Fund. We also provided digital strategy to maximize visibility and boost fundraising, such as promoting the shortcode and keyword during the #JusticeForFlint event and on social media.\n\nTo donate, viewers simply texted JUSTICE to 83224 from their mobile phone and clicked on a link to donate.\n\nIn just one day, Blackout for Human Rights built a membership base of 10,000 new SMS subscribers and the #JusticeForFlint fund received 4,000 contributions totaling over $150,000. Forty percent of people who joined the SMS list also made a contribution – an exceptional action rate. The hashtag #JusticeForFlint was the second-highest organic trending hashtag on Twitter nationally, topped only by the Academy Awards Oscars hashtag.\n\nLet’s Work Together",

    "brochure_title": "Teamsters Case Study - Revolution Messaging",
    "brochure_text": "Outcome Leveraging a successful long-term digital partnership\n\nSince the first project in 2012, we have established a long-term digital partnership with Teamsters. Revolution Messaging has been able to join the Teamsters almost as if we were part of their day-to-day staff. Today they have an award-winning website, one of the largest social followings of any other union, and an organizing department that is using mobile in the most segmented and tactical way of any Revolution Messaging clients. And, more importantly, we have a client that is self-sufficient in all of those spaces because we were able to grow together and learn from each other on the best ways to take on new challenges in the digital space. Our long-term partnership has resulted in many successful digital campaigns.\n\nThe Teamsters have driven thousands of calls to Congress and the White House about Fast Track and the Trans Pacific Partnership.\n\nDangerous trade deals or measures that limit Congress’ constitutionally mandated oversight allow other entities to decide what is best for America. When good-paying U.S. jobs and safe food and products are at risk, the Teamsters organize.\n\nWhen Fast Track legislation loomed, the Teamsters created a splash page to fight back. The page pushes members and activists to call Congress using Revere Calling. The Teamsters moved swiftly on this by promoting the splash page and texting members with a hotline number to a Revere Calling instance. This campaign generated thousands of calls to Congress. As the legislation moved from the House to the Senate, we were able to follow it with targeted calls, in addition to calls to the White House.\n\nWe have been involved in helping the Teamsters build an election center to make sure their members have the information they need to get to the polls on Election Day.\n\nDigital tactics amplified the Teamsters’ election center communications tenfold. In 2014, our team was tasked with building members-only endorsement pages. We built these unique web pages that displayed top lines from endorsed candidates and top opposition lines to their opponents. Each page had links to custom PDFs for downloading and sharing. We also drove a membership-matched advertising campaign for these targeted races, raising awareness of the Teamsters’ endorsements in each state. This direct membership match ensured that only members would view the ads, thus cutting costs and increasing saturation.\n\nThe Teamsters successfully implemented several hypertargeted advertising campaigns, including one urging bus drivers in Silicon Valley to organize.\n\nThe workers who drive buses for the well-paid employees of Facebook work from dawn until dusk, but were barely getting by. They don’t work for Facebook, but for a transportation company. A majority of the drivers wanted to join the union, so Teamsters used online targeting to ask Facebook to encourage the transportation company to recognize the union. Using hyper-local mobile ads to the Facebook employee’s bus routes and bus stops, as well as Facebook ads targeting Facebook employees at the Silicon Valley HQ, our team successfully advocated for the drivers. They voted to join the Teamsters, sparking an effort across the area to organize other drivers just like them.\n\nWe turned the Teamsters’ website into a user–friendly, modern site, that was built in responsive design to work on all mobile phones and tablets.\n\nWe sought to build upon the Teamster brand and popularity by approaching the design and features differently than any other existing union site. The resulting website, built in 2013, takes advantage of the modern functionality available at the time. In fact, it was the first union website built completely using responsive design. Because of the redesign, members can more easily navigate through the organization, discover its distinct divisions and help find their local’s info with a mapping feature using Google Maps. The website has smart share functionality on each page and unique sign up forms.\n\nWithin one month of the site launching, traffic increased by over 25,000 visitors. Visitors stayed on the site an average of 2 ½ minutes longer than the previous month. Users viewed more pages in the site at a ratio of 3:1.\n\nThe mobile program has organized several bargaining agreements as well as pushing out breaking news to members.\n\nSince the Teamsters mobile program started in 2012, it has primarily been used by their team to organize around bargaining agreements and engage potential members across the country. From freight to airline to dairy, the mobile program has been the go-to organizing tool for collecting mobile numbers and delivering breaking news around contract negotiations, elections and union news. The data collected through Revere Mobile has helped the Teamsters run smarter ads to their members around issues that are important to them. The mobile program has also leveraged its operational flexibility at international conferences, delivering news on specific event reminders or promotions.",

    "brochure_title": "YouGov | \nPanel Methodology\n",
    "brochure_text": "Panel Methodology\n\nYouGov Public Opinion research is conducted according to Market Research Society guidelines, providing national studies for commercial clients and the media.\n\nHow does YouGov conduct Public Opinion research?\n\nYouGov conducts its public opinion surveys online using something called Active Sampling for the overwhelming majority of its commercial work, including all nationally and regionally representative research. The emphasis is always on the quality of the sample, rather than the quantity of respondents.\n\nWhen using Active Sampling, restrictions are put in place to ensure that only the people contacted are allowed to participate. This means that all the respondents who complete YouGov surveys will have been selected by YouGov, from our panel of registered users, and only those who are selected from this panel are allowed to take part in the survey.\n\nWho takes part in Public Opinion research?\n\nOver the last ten years, YouGov has carefully recruited a panel of over 800,000 British adults to take part in our surveys. Panel members are recruited from a host of different sources, including via standard advertising, and strategic partnerships with a broad range of websites.\n\nWhen a new panel member is recruited, a host of socio-demographic information is recorded. For nationally representative samples, YouGov draws a sub-sample of the panel that is representative of British adults in terms of age, gender, social class and education, and invites this sub-sample to complete a survey.\n\nTo reiterate, with Active Sampling only this sub-sample has access to the questionnaire via their username and password, and respondents can only ever answer each survey once.\n\nHow is the data analysed?\n\nOnce the survey is complete, the final data are then statistically weighted to the national profile of all adults aged 18+ (including people without internet access). All reputable research agencies weight data as a fine-tuning measure and at YouGov we weight by age, gender, social class, region, level of education, how respondents voted at the previous election, how respondents voted at the EU referendum and their level of political interest. Targets for the weighted data are derived from four sources:\n\nThe census Large scale random probability surveys, such as the Labour Force Survey, The National Readership survey and the British Election Study The results of the 2015 general election. Offical ONS population estimates\n\nActive Sampling ensures that the right people are invited in the right proportions. In combination with our statistical weighting, this ensures that our results are representative of the country as a whole. Not just those with internet access, but everyone. While it is true that not everyone does have access to the internet, independent academic research shows that its widespread uptake means the views of those with access to the internet and now mostly indistinguishable from those without. Obtaining good-quality samples is a challenge for all methodologies. Response rates for telephone polls for example, have been declining in recent years - to typically below 10% - and often much lower in inner city areas. The ability to extrapolate from the under 10% of telephone respondents that pollsters can get hold of, to the 90% that they cannot, is clearly a challenge - leading to concerns over the quality of achieved samples, whether telephone or face-to-face. There are, of course, some areas where an online approach is inappropriate, and we would always alert our clients to this. However, it would be unfair to say that online is ‘biased’ in a way that offline is not. The fact is, there are different biases for which all approaches have to account.\n\nFor Scottish polls we additionally weight by country of birth and vote at the 2014 referendum on Independence. For polls of Greater London we additionally weight by ethnicity.\n\nFor information as to how our methodology has been adapted for Wales please see our commentary by Laurence Janta-Lipinski.\n\nHow YouGov prompts for voting intention\n\nWhen we ask voting intention for Westminster elections we prompt people with the names of the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, the SNP and Plaid Cymru or \"some other party\". People selecting some other party are then shown a second screen offering the choice of other smaller political parties or \"other\".\n\nThe selection of which parties we prompt for is based purely upon what past research and comparison with election results has produced the most accurate results; there is no formal criteria or level of support at which a party is prompted for. Past experience has shown us that prompting for smaller parties in the main question overestimates their level of support when compared to actual elections, while our method has consistently accurately measured levels of support for minor parties (even in cases, like European elections, when they have broken through to win widespread support).\n\nRespondents are asked to say how likely they are to vote on a scale of zero to ten and their answers to voting intention questions are additionally weighted based on their answer. Respondents who did not vote at the previous general election are additionally weighted down by 50%.\n\nIn designing our methodology, for Westminster, regional and European elections, our priority is always what our experience and research leads us to believe will produce the most accurate results.\n\nHow accurate are your results?\n\nYouGov has a strong history of accurately predicting actual outcomes across a wide range of different subjects, including national and regional elections, political party leadership contests and even the results of ITV talent show The X Factor.\n\nPanel privacy\n\nYouGov abides by the Market Research Society’s strict guidelines on confidentiality. We never divulge anything that might identify the views of individual respondents. YouGov is also a founder member of the British Polling Council and we abide by its rules.\n\nYouGov is also part of ESOMAR - you can view full details of the YouGov answers to the ESOMAR 28 questions here\n\nFor additional information on YouGov’s methodology see the research Q&A’s here.",

En el siglo XX y hasta principios del XXI se seguían utilizando herramientas tradicionales como grupos de enfoque o encuestas. Fue con la consolidación de plataformas como Google o Facebook que la situación cambió.\nCada herramienta de investigación cuenta con ventajas y problemáticas. Las encuestas se enfrentan a la mentira en las respuestas de las personas, mientras que los grupos de enfoque a su representatividad. El Big Data Político cuenta con la ventaja de conocer gustos y hábitos fieles a la realidad, pues nadie engaña a su historial de navegación, pero su problema depende del porcentaje de penetración de internet. En todo caso, es una herramienta que ha llegado para sumarse a los mecanismos de investigación.\nEl sector comercial ha desarrollado software especializados en recopilar toda esta información. La política, como usualmente sucede, se ha montado en este tren tecnológico adaptándolo a sus propósitos.\nQue lo comercial marque el camino a lo político implica dificultades. Primero, los términos, conceptos y variables que se utilizan en estos programas no son necesariamente los mismos que se requieren para campañas de gobierno o electorales.\nUn segundo problema es que esta información no está al alcance de todas las campañas por su complejidad: los datos ahí están, los software recopilan la información, pero ésta sin interpretación es inútil.\nLa última dificultad es la barrera del idioma. Como en México y en Latinoamérica se desarrolla muy poca tecnología, es necesario importarla de países desarrollados como Estados Unidos. La mayoría de estos programas sólo cuentan con su versión en inglés, lo que dificulta su uso para campañas políticas locales.\nDatametrix fue desarrollado por la consultora Acciones Estratégicas en México, como respuesta a estos desafíos. Datametrix es una herramienta que provee información, conversación y escucha en tiempo real que además permite a los equipos de campaña la toma de decisiones estratégicas.\nLa herramienta permite generar datos con los cuales la campaña podrá:\n\nConocer a tus electores\nIdentificar áreas de oportunidad\nLos puntos débiles de los adversario\nConocer la micro-segmentación de los electores\nMejorar el conocimiento de la marca política\nIdentificar la intención de voto\nControl de daños, identificación y gestión de crisis\nConocimiento de la estrategia digital de los rivales políticos\n\n¿Cómo lo hace?\nLa investigación de mercado digital se realiza mediante el procesamiento y análisis en tiempo real del 100% de las conversaciones de Facebook, Twitter, Foros, Blogs y noticias.\nLas campañas políticas de todos los niveles en Hispanoamérica ahora tienen la posibilidad de tomar decisiones más acertadas. No sólo se recopila información, sino que se clasifica y se analiza con base en el contexto regional en cuestión. El futuro de una campaña política que quiere triunfar está en entender la conversación de los usuarios, según su creador, Andrés Elías.\nLos objetivos de Datametrix son claros: \n1.- Acceso al Big Data para campañas presidenciales, sí, pero también a regionales y locales en Latinoamérica.\n2.- Análisis útil para la toma de decisiones, y no sólo grandes volúmenes de información.\nLa dependencia hacia Estados Unidos tiene que quebrantarse para dar paso a desarrollos propios de la región; Datametrix es un paso hacia adelante.\n*Datametrix fue elegida innovación digital del año por los prestigiosos premios Reed Awards, Napolitans y ALACOP.\n Jorge Parada\nConsultor\nPara más información contactarse al 3319715574\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompartir:\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnterior\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7 preguntas sobre DATAMETRIX que debes conocer\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebrero 14, 2018\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSiguiente\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDATAMETRIX obtuvo un reconocimiento por su desarrollo tecnológico en los premios “ALACOP”\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebrero 15, 2018\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n         \n\n\n    \t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSOBRE ANDRÉS ELÍAS\nSpeaker, Coach y Asesor de Comunicación Política Digital\nParte de EP Group:\nFacultad\nAcciones Estratégicas\nCANVAS\n\n\n\n\tSUSCRÍBETE\n\n\n\t\t.widget_mailchimpsf_widget .widget-title {\n\t\tline-height: 1.4em;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.75em;\n\t}\n\t#mc_subheader {\n\t\tline-height: 1.25em;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 18px;\n\t}\n\t.mc_merge_var {\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 1.0em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_var_label,\n\t.mc_interest_label {\n\t\tdisplay: block;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_input {\n\t\t-moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n\t\t-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\n\t\tbox-sizing: border-box;\n\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t}\n\t.mc_input.mc_phone {\n\t\twidth: auto;\n\t}\n\tselect.mc_select {\n\t\tmargin-top: 0.5em;\n\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t}\n\t.mc_address_label {\n\t\tmargin-top: 1.0em;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.5em;\n\t\tdisplay: block;\n\t}\n\t.mc_address_label ~ select {\n\t\twidth: 100%;\t\t\n\t}\n\t.mc_list li {\n\t\tlist-style: none;\n\t\tbackground: none !important;\n\t}\n\t.mc_interests_header {\n\t\tmargin-top: 1.0em;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_interest label,\n\t.mc_interest input {\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.4em;\n\t}\n\t#mc_signup_submit {\n\t\tmargin-top: 1.5em;\n\t\twidth: 80%;\n\t}\n\t#mc_unsub_link a {\n\t\tfont-size: 0.75em;\n\t}\n\t#mc_unsub_link {\n\t\tmargin-top: 1.0em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_header_address,\n\t.mc_email_format {\n\t\tdisplay: block;\n\t\tfont-weight: bold;\n\t\tmargin-top: 1.0em;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_email_options {\n\t\tmargin-top: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_email_type {\n\t\tpadding-left: 4px;\n\t}\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\tEmail Address\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\tSíguenos\t\n\t\t\t\nÚLTIMOS TWEETS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRT @HistoriaEnFotos: Hombre con su perro en brazos logró salvarlo de la tragedia del volcán de fuego en Guatemala.

Esta información proviene de varias fuentes: de tus compras, de tus interacciones en redes sociales, es decir, cada actividad que deje una estela de datos, las plataformas de Big Data la analizan y la procesan. Esta información sirve para tomar decisiones como lo veremos más adelante.\nPara que nos demos una idea, un iPhone hoy en día tiene más capacidad de cómputo que la NASA cuando el hombre llegó a la luna.\nPara mí es Big Data\nPara mí el Social Listening es Big Data. Para Daniel no lo es, para él, el Social Listening recoge información de una sola fuente: las redes sociales. No toma información de otras fuentes que pueden ser determinantes para realizar modelos predictivos.\nPara mí, el Social Listening es Big Data, debido a que si partimos del criterio que las redes sociales son una sola fuente, así tiene lógica lo que dice Daniel, pero si lo enfocamos desde la perspectiva de que las redes sociales son diferentes plataformas y cada una es una fuente diferente, porque reciben al día millones de datos, la cosa cambia. Es cuestión de perspectiva.\nSuperando esta discusión, el Big Data me ha funcionado a mí en todas campañas políticas que he realizado. ¿Por qué? Porque funciona y así lo delatan estos hechos.\nCasos Prácticos\nLos datos nos han ayudado a predecir tormentas, huracanes, terremotos, erupciones volcánicas o tsunamis. Para monitorear la evolución del cambio climático. Para conocer el estado de nuestros mares, discernir el comportamiento de los animales o realizar el seguimiento de especies amenazadas… Y por qué no para ganar elecciones.\nA menudo, en las escuchas que abro para los clientes que me contratan puedo inclusive identificar no solo patrones de comportamiento sino hasta intención de voto.\nCuando entrego los informes, en su mayoría les desgloso el perfil de ese votante potencial, sus necesidades y el sentir que tiene con respecto a lo que espera del candidato. De esa manera, su equipo puede orientar la comunicación hacia lo que el votante quiere escuchar.\nComo no puedo mencionar a mis clientes, voy a poner dos casos dónde los datos predijeron con exactitud los comportamientos del consumidor:\nCaso Facebook\nUn grupo de investigadores de las universidades de Cambridge y Stanford con un estudio realizado apoyaron la tesis de que “Facebook te conoce mejor que tu mismo”. La investigación llegó a la conclusión que Facebook podía predecir mucho mejor la personalidad humana que su familia y sus amigos a través de los likes que las personas estudiadas le daban a ciertas publicaciones y páginas. Los investigadores también demostraron que podían predecir su color de piel (con 95% de precisión), su orientación sexual (88% de precisión) y su afiliación al Partido Demócrata o Republicano (85%).\nEs decir, Facebook te conoce mejor que tú mismo.\nCaso Walmart\nLa cadena Walmart descubrió, a partir del cruce de sus informes de ventas con los datos meteorológicos, que las galletas Pop-Tarts se vendían muchísimo tras la alerta de un huracán, ya  que la gente hacía acopio de provisiones. Esa información inesperada provocó que la multinacional posicionara esas galletas de forma destacada cada vez que el hombre del tiempo alertaba de un fuerte temporal, lo que ha redundado en un importante aumento de las ventas.\nCaso Target\nHace un par de años la cadena Target envió a una adolescente de Minneapolis cupones de descuento para productos premamá y de bebé. El padre acudió al centro hecho una furia. Pero a los pocos días la chica confesó que, efectivamente, estaba embarazada. Había comprado complementos vitamínicos, toallitas sin perfume y otro tipo de productos que llevaron al programa informático de la tienda a considerarla una madre en potencia.\nCaso La Cueva\nLa Cueva era una sala secreta del cuartel general de campaña en Chicago de Barack Obama donde se ponía en marcha toda la maquinaria de análisis, prospectiva, simulación y estrategia. El uso de Big Data ayudó al equipo de Obama a diseñar un mensaje específico, centrado y dirigido a cierto segmento de la población.\nAsí descubrieron cosas interesantes, como que por ejemplo una cena con George Clooney (y Obama, claro) era uno de los elementos que mejor servían para recaudar fondos entre las mujeres de 40 a 49 años.\nDescubrieron que anunciarse en las pausas publicitarias de Walking Dead o en Reddit era una gran inversión, ya que ahí se encontraban los segmentos a los que tenían que convencer.\nEl análisis de los datos permitió descubrir que Michelle Obama era un gran reclamo para conseguir financiación en primavera o que a veces el nombre del responsable de campaña, el propio Messina, era más efectivo que el vicepresidente Joe Biden en una campaña de mailing.\nCaso Trump\nSu campaña creó casi 250 millones de perfiles. Y una vez que clasificaron a cada individuo, lo empezaron a atacar. Por ejemplo, en el tercer debate con Clinton, Trump planteó un argumento, y los algoritmos crearon 175 mil versiones de este mensaje –con variaciones en la imagen, el subtítulo, el color, la explicación, etc.– y lo mandaron de manera personalizada.\nCuando Trump dijo “estoy por el derecho a tener armas”, algunos recibieron esa frase con la imagen de un criminal que entra a una casa, porque era gente más miedosa, y otros que eran más patriotas la recibieron con la imagen de un tipo que va a cazar con su hijo.\nSocial Listening y política\nLa magia del Social Listening es que permite detectar a los electores más “persuadibles” para cierto candidato y enviarles comunicaciones directas y personalizadas, sin malgastar recursos en votantes que ya decidieron su voto o que no lo respaldarían bajo ningún concepto.\nLa relevancia de la segmentación es crear mensajes dirigidos a estos grupos, para así reclutar votantes que, de otra forma, no se hubieran identificado nunca con el candidato o para activar a aquellos que están de acuerdo en una temática concreta, pero no tanto con el resto de temas.\nY por último…\nEl Social Listening:\nPredice el comportamiento electoral porque ayuda a conocer el sentir del votante.\nPotencia la comunicación y la interacción digital porque hay una mejora en la escucha del ciudadano y por lo tanto se personaliza el mensaje.\n*En el tiempo que

Todo lo anterior no sin antes proporcionar orientación teórica por parte de los mejores expertos en el área.\nSe propició una gran química entre los asistentes, quienes compartieron experiencia, conocimiento e historias. Entre ellos nos acompañaron consultores políticos, mercadólogos, líderes juveniles e incluso directores de uno de los medios de comunicación más importantes del país. Esto se añadió a nuestra lista de valores agregados pues no sólo es un ambiente de aprendizaje sino de socialización y relaciones públicas.\n*INSCRÍBETE.\nEl objetivo propuesto al inicio del bootcamp se cumplió de principio a fin e incluso, superó las expectativas ya que con nuestro profesional equipo se superaron todas las pruebas que surgían de último momento.\nAl final del día y acompañados de una sonrisa; retroalimentamos las técnicas y tácticas empleadas de cada equipo así como su gestión de recursos comunicativos en redes sociales que llevaron a los equipos perdedores o victoriosos. Todo con la finalidad de que cada participante se llevara un arma infalible de experiencia y conocimiento de acción real con los recursos y necesidades profesionales que se requieren para llevar a cabo una acción comunicativa eficiente en el mundo digital.\n¡Es tu turno de vivir la inolvidable experiencia!\n\nPróxima fecha: 14 y 15 de febrero en Guadalajara,\n\n \n¿Lo quieres en tu ciudad? INSCRÍBETE\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompartir:\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAnterior\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t¡Los expertos te aconsejan como ganar las siguientes elecciones!\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnero 4, 2018\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSiguiente\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSocial Listening: Tecnología de punta para estas elecciones\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEnero 22, 2018\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n         \n\n\n    \t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\tSOBRE ANDRÉS ELÍAS\nSpeaker, Coach y Asesor de Comunicación Política Digital\nParte de EP Group:\nFacultad\nAcciones Estratégicas\nCANVAS\n\n\n\n\tSUSCRÍBETE\n\n\n\t\t.widget_mailchimpsf_widget .widget-title {\n\t\tline-height: 1.4em;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.75em;\n\t}\n\t#mc_subheader {\n\t\tline-height: 1.25em;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 18px;\n\t}\n\t.mc_merge_var {\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 1.0em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_var_label,\n\t.mc_interest_label {\n\t\tdisplay: block;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_input {\n\t\t-moz-box-sizing: border-box;\n\t\t-webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\n\t\tbox-sizing: border-box;\n\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t}\n\t.mc_input.mc_phone {\n\t\twidth: auto;\n\t}\n\tselect.mc_select {\n\t\tmargin-top: 0.5em;\n\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t}\n\t.mc_address_label {\n\t\tmargin-top: 1.0em;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.5em;\n\t\tdisplay: block;\n\t}\n\t.mc_address_label ~ select {\n\t\twidth: 100%;\t\t\n\t}\n\t.mc_list li {\n\t\tlist-style: none;\n\t\tbackground: none !important;\n\t}\n\t.mc_interests_header {\n\t\tmargin-top: 1.0em;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_interest label,\n\t.mc_interest input {\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.4em;\n\t}\n\t#mc_signup_submit {\n\t\tmargin-top: 1.5em;\n\t\twidth: 80%;\n\t}\n\t#mc_unsub_link a {\n\t\tfont-size: 0.75em;\n\t}\n\t#mc_unsub_link {\n\t\tmargin-top: 1.0em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_header_address,\n\t.mc_email_format {\n\t\tdisplay: block;\n\t\tfont-weight: bold;\n\t\tmargin-top: 1.0em;\n\t\tmargin-bottom: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_email_options {\n\t\tmargin-top: 0.5em;\n\t}\n\t.mc_email_type {\n\t\tpadding-left: 4px;\n\t}\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\tEmail Address\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\tSíguenos\t\n\t\t\t\nÚLTIMOS TWEETS\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRT @HistoriaEnFotos: Hombre con su perro en brazos logró salvarlo de la tragedia del volcán de fuego en Guatemala.

    "brochure_text": "Combination Data Analytics Data analytics has made significant advances in using ‘big data’ to provide insight into human behavior. However, the behavioral models are limited by the type of data recorded. SCL adds another dimension to big data analytics by incorporating social and psychological models to the analysis process. This allows the analysts to use not only inductive data (pattern recognition from the database) but also deductive data (hypothetical social science modelling).\n\nData Driven Program Assessments There is significant pressure on military and government agencies to provide ‘effectiveness metrics’ for projects and campaigns. SCL provides credible and quantifiable assessments that measures the actual changes achieved within the audience group. Our Audience Based Measures of Effectiveness provides key leaders and financial decision makers with an accountable return on investment metrics for budget investment.\n\nDecision Support One of the most challenging planning tasks a commander faces is a reliable understanding of the information environment. SCL offers a real time planning platform that allows planners and commanders to fully assess the information environment using behavioral profiling data from the field, combined with a variety of digital feeds from the target location. Precise information about the groups operating in the area of responsibility, allows for strategic approaches to be tailored to ensure success in advance of any operation.\n\nCounter Radicalization & Recruitment Counter radicalization examines the propaganda and recruiting messages emanating from terrorist and radical groups to recruit vulnerable targets. SCL employs social science models to understand how radical messages are appealing and uses powerful counter narrative strategies to neutralize misinformation. SCL has an impressive history of reducing radical recruitment over the last decade and is currently supporting this effort for elements of the US government.\n\nMilitary Recruiting Recruiting, sustaining, and deploying the world’s most advance military requires deep insights to resource the military services reflecting the diversity and talent of the Nation’s eligible population. SCL employs advanced data analytics to understand both the macro and micro targeting of the eligible population informing precise modeling to fulfill the broadest and niche military occupations specialties. Precision modeling paired with tailored media engagement reduces acquisition cost, enhances talent quality, and increases contract efficiency.\n\nCounter State Influence The information environment has become the new modern battlefield where state and non-state actors employ sophisticated propaganda and disinformation against the US and its allies. SCL is at the vanguard of this fight employing advanced data analytics to identify the misleading campaigns and incorporating our behavioral tools to counter their messaging. Our deep understanding of how maligned propaganda is circulated and consumed allows us to provide alternative narratives and credible perspectives.",

SCL’s data and analytics revealed that the Ukrainian government’s credibility was extremely low with target audiences. Willingness to consider the case for a united Ukraine did not translate into support for Kiev. Further, the dispute was highly localized in nature, so any countrywide, Kiev-centered communication campaign was likely to fail. These findings were applied to design localized communications campaigns to erode and weaken the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR). The final project report was delivered to the President of Ukraine for his Cabinet’s assessment and shared with the UK MOD.

This meant that the client's scheduled programs to reduce violence would instead have increased it. The client redesigned their programs to accurately align with their objective, and further used the data to justify their resource request.",

All of L2’s email databases originate from opt-in sources and all addresses are tested for deliverability, making our product compliant and effective with nationwide coverage. With L2 email you can:Emails sold by L2 come from matches we perform to multiple national email databases. Through complex processing our team is able to match those emails back to the L2 voter file or a private file. The typical email match rate to selections made from the L2 voter file is between 20% and 35%. Match rates against private files you provide to us will vary greatly depending on the age, source and cleanliness of your file. We also run our emails through multiple verification and cleaning processes including performing an SMTP “handshake” which confirms that the email has been found in the directory for its domain. (For example that a Gmail email address is listed on the Gmail address servers.) Email addresses verified in this industry-standard way should have a delivery rate of 90% or better. We also perform a wide variety of email hygiene processes including weeding out unlikely matches, spam traps and formatting errors. Commercially-appended email addresses will not be accepted by many of the most well known email deployment firms including Mail Chimp, Constant Contact and others. These firms prohibit the uploading of commercially-acquired email addresses and will reject such files if they show more than a percentage point or two of undeliverable addresses—a standard no commercially-appended email file will ever be able to meet. They limit their services to email deployment of small lists of organically-acquired email addresses sourced from organizational and customer business files. The good news is that there are many email deployment firms that don’t have these limitations and that specialize in commercial deployments. Please contact us for recommendations.",

But whether the message was a dirty trickster’s attempt to undermine the system or just an ill-informed public service effort, the anger and uncertainty it generated represented an early skirmish in the battle over disinformation in this year’s fiercely contested election season.\n\n“What candidates do on social media will be decisive,” said Carlos Merlo, managing partner of Victory Lab, a marketing firm dedicated to spreading viral claims, saying they must respond quicker than ever to combat disinformation.\n\nThere is a lot at stake in the July 1 vote: over 3,400 elected positions at the local, state and federal levels, more than in any other election in Mexican history. The biggest prize is the presidency, with five candidates on the ballot competing to succeed President Enrique Peña Nieto for a six-year term.",
