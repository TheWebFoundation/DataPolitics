    "article_text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Xaxis, the world’s largest programmatic media and technology platform, announced today the launch of Xaxis Politics, the industry’s first targeted political advertising solution for reaching U.S. voters across all digital channels without utilizing personally identifiable information. Developed with Haystaq DNA, Xaxis Politics is the first programmatic product that enables advertisers to leverage offline voter data to inform their digital campaigns. This means that political advertisers can reach their most relevant voters across display, mobile, online video, digital radio, connected TV and social media.\n\nXaxis Politics incorporates the Haystaq National Voter Database – the nation’s largest and most accurate source of voter data, representing 166 million voters – into Xaxis’s proprietary Turbine data management platform (DMP), enabling advertisers to engage voters across a multitude of hot button issues, political affiliations and other demographic information. This offering utilizes Haystaq DNA data to understand which audiences are most interested in which issues, while also leveraging Turbine’s real-time audience data to more effectively direct advertisers’ messaging. Campaigns can be locally focused or nationally scaled across Xaxis’s industry leading portfolio of premium digital inventory.\n\n“Voter data is the lifeblood of political advertising, with a lengthy pedigree as the engine of successful direct voter marketing,” said Brian Gleason, the newly named global CEO of Xaxis. “By bringing this data into the digital space, we’re opening up an entirely new level of sophistication for political marketers competing to have their voices heard in a crowded and fragmented market.”\n\nWith Xaxis Politics, advertisers can segment audiences by hundreds of hot button issues as well as by party affiliation, demographic information and likelihood of turnout. Advertisers can also easily run real-time campaigns tied to specific real-world events, such as running a digital ad campaign synced to a statement that a candidate says during a televised political debate. In addition, Xaxis Politics provides campaigns with unprecedented capability in reaching younger voters on their mobile devices, empowering them to connect with an audience that is notoriously difficult to reach by traditional means such as TV ads.\n\nHaystaq DNA CEO Ken Strasma called the partnership with Xaxis “truly revolutionary.” “Political marketers have come to expect the accuracy of individual-level targeting models for direct mail, phones and door-to-door canvasing. Until now, using those models to target voters online has been a time-consuming and expensive custom process. With more than 20 pre-built models predicting turnout, partisanship, ideology and positions on hot-button issues, now it is easy for online campaigns to target the right voters with the right message at the right time.”\n\nAbout Xaxis\n\nXaxis is a global digital media platform that programmatically connects advertisers to audiences across all addressable channels. Through the expert use of proprietary data and advertising technology along with unparalleled media relationships, Xaxis delivers results for over 2,800 clients in 42 markets across North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East. Advertisers working with Xaxis achieve exceptionally high return on advertising spend through the company’s proprietary media products, as well as through its specialist companies, Light Reaction, Bannerconnect, and ActionX.

    "article_text": "PHILIPPINES, 16 February 2016 - Xaxis, the world’s largest programmatic media and technology platform, announced today the launch of Xaxis Politics to coincide with the Philippines Presidential Elections due to take place in May 2016.\n\nXaxis Politics will be the first programmatic product in APAC that enables political advertisers to leverage on real time anonymous voter data to inform their digital campaigns in real time. This means that political candidates can reach their most relevant voters across display, mobile, online video, digital radio, connected TV and social media.\n\n“Powered by Xaxis’s proprietary data management platform (DMP),Turbine, Xaxis Politics is a market leading product innovation that enables advertisers to engage with voters across a multitude of hot button issues, political affiliations and other demographic information,” said Arshan Saha, Vice President of Xaxis SEA.\n\nKnowing someone’s political affiliation is crucial for campaigns looking to reach reliable or persuadable voters. Xaxis Politics provides that critical advantage to political advertisers to target voters in real time; which is a dream for any politician. Political advertisers will also be able to know which audiences are most interested in which issues.\n\nAll these while leveraging Turbine’s real-time audience data to more effectively direct their messaging. Campaigns can be locally focused or nationally scaled across Xaxis’s industry leading portfolio of premium digital inventory.\n\n“Knowing where, how, why and what your voters are talking and getting concerned about is the crux of every politicians’ campaign. These insights not only help them communicate their messages effectively, but to also craft the right message to the right demographic in a crowded digital space”, said Laurent Goirand, Head of Digital at GroupM Philippines.\n\nThe insights and data exclusive only to Xaxis and GroupM were collated during a joint research in Philippines to identify and analyse the different segments in demographics that were skewed to each presidential candidate. Besides using proprietary Turbine data, a survey targeting both in-country and overseas working Filipinos was conducted to further understand voter sentiments and behaviors.\n\n“GroupM and Xaxis are the market leads in media investment and programmatic respectively in Philippines. With the combined industry and technological advantage and scale that we have as a group, we are able to present a product that is fitting for the biggest event that is set to take place in Philippines this year”, said Puneet Arora, GroupM’s Singapore CEO and Chairman for the Philippines and Thailand.\n\nIn addition, Xaxis Politics provides campaigns with unprecedented capability in reaching voters on various mediums, empowering them to connect with suburban audiences who may not be digitally connected. This was an evident success in the U.S when on the flipside political advertisers were able to reach the mobile savvy demographic who were otherwise hard to reach via traditional media.\n\n“Xaxis Politics was first launched in the U.S for the 2016 Presidential Elections as the industry’s first targeted political advertising solution to reach voters across all digital channels without utilizing personally identifiable information, and we have seen some very good results from campaigns that have ran. We have taken that success and learnings and adapted it for the Philippines Presidential Elections, and we cannot wait to see the results”, added Saha.\n\nAbout Xaxis\n\nXaxis is a global digital media platform that programmatically connects advertisers to audiences across all addressable channels.

    "article_text": "WPP-owned ad network-slash-tech shop Xaxis has its first-ever Latin America CEO. Lucas Mentasti was promoted from the unit’s Latin America managing director to its chief. It’s a big step up from where he started in 2013, moving from Publicis-owned Starcom to head up Xaxis’ Latin America business. At that time, “head up” meant doing everything, from selling to counting all the I/Os. Such are the glories of being the only employee. Xaxis’ Latin America unit has grown significantly since then. It doubled from 15 employees in 2014 to 30 in 2015 as Mentasti expanded the business from Mexico to Brazil, Argentina and Colombia. (Its Miami office manages Puerto Rico.) Later this year, Xaxis will open offices in Chile, Peru and Uruguay and, by the year’s end, Mentasti anticipates 60 Xaxis staffers in his unit. While Mentasti wouldn’t say precisely how much of Xaxis’ revenue comes from the region – where it has 250 clients – he noted that Latin America, without Brazil, represents 5% of global GDP, which is more or less in line with Xaxis’ geographic revenue splits. Mentasti sat down with AdExchanger to talk about the complexities of doing business in a region with vastly different cultures and why Brazil has no true media agencies.\n\n\n\nAdExchanger: How much total programmatic spend in Latin America spend flows through Xaxis?\n\nLUCAS MENTASTI: If programmatic is platform-based, I’d say 70-80% of budgets in Latin America is programmatic, because of [digital platforms like] Google, Facebook and Twitter. And traditional publishers like the newspapers and the magazines are venturing into programmatic platforms.\n\nAround 15% of that goes through Xaxis. I’d expect that to be 30-35% in three years.\n\nI’m guessing Google and Facebook are eating up most of it?\n\nYes. We historically have Google, Facebook and maybe Yahoo and the global players. And then there are the local publishing companies with their own websites. Those publishers have a local sales force, which charges high CPMs and rely mostly on their brand.\n\nWhen programmatic buying started to appear, the publishers didn’t know how to compensate the direct sales people and make the commission structure. That held back the progression of the traditional publishers in LatAm. Until last year, they hadn’t developed technology to keep up with the global publishers.\n\nXaxis hopes to change these markets by bringing in media products.\n\nHow does Xaxis compete with establishments like Google and Facebook?\n\nWe are smaller so we can be faster. We are first in market to sell some of the technology we have. We have developed the very first Latin America platform. By the time the big monsters catch up, we’ll be developing the next piece of technology.\n\nAre there other shops you compete with that are also nimbler than the big guys?\n\nThere are some. But in Latin America, instead of investing in technology, they just whitelabel something and concentrate all resources on distribution channels. Our competitors focus on opening offices everywhere in LatAm and agency relationships. Headway Digital has been there for a while.\n\nBut Latin America is a very specific market with specific rules, and we’ve seen some important global players try to get in and fail.\n\nWhat mistakes do others make?\n\nThe culture is one. We’re Latin so relations are important. The second thing is assuming the market will move at the same speed as more developed countries so they overinvest, but once they see the returns, they pull out.\n\nWhen Xaxis entered Latin America, it did so through Mexico and not Brazil. Why was that?\n\nInternational companies usually start in Brazil, which is a very different market from the rest of Latin America. It’s very hard. My decision was to start in Mexico, which is a little smaller than Brazil, but they’re close to the US and are more advanced. Some areas like travel and financial services are really advanced and have the scale. Mexico is big enough for global teams to look.\n\nWhat makes Brazil hard?\n\nTwo things: There are no media agencies in Brazil. When I started out in advertising around the early 2000s, it had one creative agency that was doing both the creative and the planning and buying of media.\n\nThey focus more on the creative side than the media side, and they’re all still ruled by the creative side. Media departments tend to be less advanced since they don’t specialize and don’t know how much to sell to the suppliers or how to take advantage of all the things that programmatic buying allows.\n\nOn the publisher side, Brazilian media conglomerates want to do big, shiny things and don’t want to do much on measurement.\n\nLet’s talk Argentina.\n\nArgentina has a very strong entrepreneurial spirit, which makes it very advanced, and there are a lot of online travel agencies from Argentina. Clients are more advanced and there’s talent, which is easy to recruit. And it’s the opposite of Mexico. It’s so far away, Argentina isn’t observed by the global teams, so they do what they want.\n\nThey’re more willing to try new things. They’re not scared the global team will come to them and tell them something. What does scare me a little is Puerto Rico, which is a special case, as it’s between the US and Latin America. They need to follow the US on lots of things.\n\nHow advanced is Puerto Rico?\n\nNot really. It’s related to how much we can capture data. The Spanish version of a website is usually the simplified version of the US site. They’re not allowed to implement their own pixels.\n\nWhy not take the Mexico version of the site to Puerto Rico?\n\nIt’s hard to explain how much difference there is between Latin American countries. Even though we all speak Spanish, our Spanish is very different. The cultures are very different, and Mexico is too Mexican for the rest of Latin America.\n\nIs it common for a brand’s localized website to have that problem?\n\nFor the moment, we’re in the big countries where they have scale to manage their website. Once we get to the smaller countries like Paraguay and Ecuador, we’ll be having that problem.\n\nWhy are you going to Chile, Peru and Uruguay?\n\nBasically scale. Our source of business comes from two places: the migration of offline dollars online and the migration from traditional media buying to programmatic buying. We’ve reached the tipping point where the numbers make sense.",

We’re going places and you’ll go places with us.’\n\nBut how, I wondered, will this person find a role working with Peter Saville, who is one of the world’s leading psychometricians, a serial successful entrepreneur and author of over 100 tests. After the success of SHL and Saville Consulting, surely Peter can create a new company’s products without help. ‘No. We want new blood. Work is rapidly changing and we’re looking for younger people with new ideas who can meet new needs. It would be good to find someone who is chartered but I’m agnostic about precise qualifications. We need someone numerate and with real job knowledge; who understands multivariate statistics, R, IRT, people analytics – the new wave of tools that psychometricians use. Then we need someone who is creative. And finally, our new director must have business nous – if someone comes up with a great idea I’ll say, “Come back with a worked-through plan to make it happen” – so we’re looking for project skills and financial discipline. This is a great opportunity to get out from under a glass ceiling.’\n\nI can imagine Peter’s reputation might inhibit younger psychometricians but, as he says, ‘they’ll work for a new CEO who we’ll appoint. In any case I’m not a micro-manager. Working in a start-up you get a lot of freedom – this person will have smart targets but how he/she gets there is up to them. We’re looking for someone who likes working with other people and is prepared to contribute ideas and effort to get to team goals. They’ll not mind working or playing hard.’\n\nPeter obviously sees their new offices as a plus. ‘We’re in the Surrey Research Park, Guildford. This puts us close to the university as well as offering great facilities, like a superb gym.’ He also stresses that the company has already made huge progress over the last six months. ‘We have some key staff in place and we’ve developed our platform very quickly.’\n\nYou would have thought that, given his track record, Peter would be content to sit back, play tennis and golf and listen to the soul music he loves. But he’s enthusiastic about the future of 10x Psychometrics. ‘We’ll grow internationally. We’ll pioneer new ways of doing things. And we’ll have fun doing it.’\n\n- Find out more on our Jobs in Psychology website.",

    "article_text": "This past Wednesday, ComScore raised $82 million in an IPO that jumped 42% in its first day of trading. Some investors clearly like ComScore’s business, but I wonder whether they fully understand ComScore’s business model, privacy implications, and poor track record of nonconsensual installations.\n\nComScore’s tracking software is remarkably invasive. The privacy policy for ComScore’s RelevantKnowledge tracking program purports to grant ComScore the right to track users’ name and address, browsing, shopping, and even \"online accounts … includ[ing] personal financial [and] health information.\" Based on these privacy concerns, well-respected security researchers have long warned about ComScore’s software. For example, in 2004 Cornell University began blocking all communications with ComScore’s MarketScore tracking servers. Multiple other universities (including Columbia University and Indiana University) followed up with special warnings to their users.\n\nAt least as serious are ComScore’s installation practices. ComScore pays independent distributors to install ComScore software onto users’ computers. Predictably, some of these distributors install ComScore software without getting user consent. Some specific examples:\n\nOn Wednesday (June 27, 2007), I browsed ExitExchange, a well-known banner farm widely loaded in popups and popunders by various sites (as well as some spyware programs). ExitExchange showed several ads, one of which performed a security exploit that installed ComScore’s RelevantKnowledge. See video proof. Notice the exploit beginning at 0:12. When I ran a HijackThis scan to check for infections (0:29), I found RelevantKnowledge’s \"rk.exe\" already running (1:10), even though I had not granted permission for it to install. Packet log analysis indicates that the installation was performed by Topinstalls and by Searchclickads. The installation was predicated on two simultaneous attempted exploits — one using a Java vulnerability, another using a Microsoft MSXML vulnerability. Also installed (all without my consent): Deskwizz/Searchingbooth, Look2me, and WebBuying, among others not yet identified.\n\nI previously observed and recorded a substantially similar nonconsensual installation of RelevantKnowledge (by these same distributors) on April 26, 2007.\n\nSpyware researchers at Sunbelt Software observed a nonconsensual installation of RelevantKnowledge, seemingly by these same distributors, earlier in June 2007. Sunbelt staff browsed FirstStolz and received an exploit that installed TopInstalls and Searchclickads, which in turn installed RelevantKnowledge.\n\nIn August-September 2006, I repeatedly observed RelevantKnowledge installed by DollarRevenue, a notorious spyware bundler (subsequently shut down by Dutch law enforcement). In my testing, DollarRevenue installed RelevantKnowledge software without users’ consent. ComScore staff later admitted they had \"engaged in partnership negotiations with DollarRevenue.\" ComScore claims it never paid DollarRevenue — but I personally observed and recorded DollarRevenue installing ComScore software onto my testing systems.\n\nIn November 2005, I observed ComScore’s MarketScore software installed by PacerD, a notorious spyware bundler that installed through widespread exploits syndicated through ad networks. PacerD installed RelevantKnowledge without user consent.\n\nIn April 2007, I observed ComScore’s MarketScore software installed when users request and install a media converter program. The inclusion of MarketScore was disclosed only if users scrolled to page four of a box simply labeled \"License Agreement.\" No on-screen label indicated that multiple documents were concatenated into that single scroll box, nor did any short notice or other prominent text make any mention of RelevantKnowledge’s presence or effects. These omissions stand in stark contrast to recent FTC precedent requiring \"clear and prominent disclosure of material terms prior to and separate from any end user license agreement.\"\n\nComScore’s nonconsensual installations are particularly notable because TRUSTe’s Trusted Download program recently granted a certification (albeit \"provisional\") to ComScore’s RelevantKnowledge software. I’ve previously criticized other TRUSTe certifications — concerned that TRUSTe-certified sites may be no safer than other sites, and arguably less safe. That said, to TRUSTe’s credit, Integrated Search Technologies’ Vomba is no longer on TRUSTe’s Trusted Download list — albeit a result that TRUSTe attributes to Vomba’s financial concerns rather than to security researchers‘ critique of Vomba’s practices and lineage. Whatever the reasons for IST’s removal, perhaps ComScore’s MarketScorecould stand for an equally thorough review.\n\nComScore also boasts a \"WebTrust\" seal from Ernst & Young. See the associated Audit Report. Ernst & Young indicates that it \"test[ed] and evaluat[ed] the operating effectiveness\" of ComSCore’s internal controls but concedes that \"error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\"\n\nUpdate – TRUSTe’s Response (July 26, 2007)\n\nOn Friday July 20 — well after the close of the East Coast business day, and fully three weeks after I first reported the nonconsensual installs described above — TRUSTe announced that ComScore’s RelevantKnowledge has been removed from the Trusted Download whitelist for three months.\n\nI have mixed views about this outcome. On one hand, it’s certainly an improvement from prior TRUSTe practice, during which companies as notorious as Direct Revenue were allowed to continue to hold TRUSTe privacy seals despite widespread nonconsensual installations. But a comment from Sunbelt Software’s Eric Howes offers compelling concerns. Eric explains:\n\n[TRUSTe has] essentially decided to continue working with ComScore, provided ComScore spends a token amount of time in the “naughty corner.” … Who loses as a result? Consumers and web surfers ultimately, as ComScore will be allowed to continue plying its trade of surreptitious, underhanded installs of its RelevantKnowledge software to support some very aggressive and intrusive data collection on unsuspecting users’ machines, all with PR cover from TRUSTe.\n\nEric also cites a June 27 exchange between Sunbelt CEO Alex Eckleberry and TRUSTe’s Colin O’Malley. Transcribing from the audio recording of the Anti-Spyware Coalition‘s public workshop :\n\nAlex Eckelberry: “So what if you have an application that is installing through an exploit? Do those guys go through a probationary process, or do they just get cut off? Are they just gone?”\n\nColin O’Malley: “If they’re installing through an exploit, that’s covered in what’s described in what we describe as our prohibited activities. That’s not an activity that is acceptable by any level of notice, and so they’re terminated immediately.”\n\nAlex Eckelberry: “Good. OK.”\n\nRemarkably, TRUSTe’s spokesperson now claims Colin promised termination only when a vendor itself uses exploits, but not when its distributors do so. Reports Vnunet: \"’Colin [O’Malley]’s remarks were specifically about a company that is directly responsible,’ the spokesperson explained. ‘In this case, it was the affiliate that was exploiting the flaw.'”\n\nI’ve read and reread the exchange, and listened repeatedly for good measure. On my interpretation, Colin plainly promised to terminate any vendor whose software is becoming installed through exploits — no matter whether the vendor itself performs the exploit, or whether the exploit is performed by one of the vendor’s distributors. I reach this conclusion for two separate reasons:\n\n1) The plain language of Alex’s question is intentionally inclusive as to who is doing the installation. Notice the broad \"that is installing\" — vague as to how exactly the installation is occurring.\n\n2) Distributor-perpetrated exploit installs have been standard practice in the \"adware\" industrry. That’s what I widely observed as to 180solutions, Direct Revenue, eXact Advertising, and so many others. Meanwhile, vendor-perpetrated exploit installs are few and far between — common only among little-known companies, and even then usually comingled with installing third parties’ software. So if Colin had wanted to remark only on the (unusual or unprecedented) vendor-perpetrated exploits, he would have needed to say that specifically.\n\nPerhaps TRUSTe regrets the breadth of Colin’s promise. But Colin made a tough commitment for good reason: As Colin spoke to dozens of anti-spyware researchers already suspicious of Trusted Download, his big promises helped bolster TRUSTe’s credibility. Had Colin told the ASC what now seems to be TRUSTe’s policy — that some exploit-based installs yield only a temporary suspension — I gather Alex would have questioned Colin further to emphasize the need for a tougher response. Other meeting attendees would probably have done the same.\n\nIn any event, if Colin’s goal was to build support among anti-spyware researchers, his efforts don’t seem to be succeeding. Eric continues:\n\nTh[is] case was significant in that it was the first big public test of how well TRUSTe would perform when called to defend the standards that allegedly undergird the Trusted Download program. When push came to shove, though, TRUSTe demonstrated itself to be lacking the backbone to deliver on its word. [This is] another illustration of why we at Sunbelt place no value whatsoever in TRUSTe’s whitelisting and certifications.\n\nAdded FaceTime’s Chris Boyd:\n\nFor Gods sake, when are we going to stop gimping around and actually break out some actual punishments for people? Either kick someone from your program and be done with it, or … just give up already.\n\nTRUSTe’s extreme delay further compromises the standing of Trusted Download: Three weeks elapsed before TRUSTe responded to my documentation and proof of nonconsensual ComScore RelevantKnowledge installations. Throughout that period, the Trusted Download whitelist continued to list RelevantKnowledge — falsely suggesting that RelevantKnowledge was in good standing. Internet users deserve better: When TRUSTe learns of an infraction of such seriousness, all applicable web pages ought to be updated promptly, lest the Internet community mistakenly proceed in reliance on TRUSTe’s supposed diligence.",

He also highlights his 11-hour trip to \"collect some tequila and some tacos\" and meet with clients who want \"to do a handshake and just sign some documents.\"\n\nThe director goes on to talk about how they have to be very careful in Mexico because drug money is involved in politics and siding with the wrong politician can be lethal.\n\nAccording to Galdos, the firm's directors met with several politicians in Mexico in an attempt to secure a bigger contract, but it was unclear if they were successful.\n\nA previous report by Channel 4 shows Cambridge Analytica's Nix; Global Politics General Director Mark Turnbull and Chief of Data Office Alex Tayler talking about how they used bribery, former spies, fake news and sex workers to pressure politicians and interfere in the electoral process in several countries, including Mexico.\n\nArielle Dale Karro, Cambridge Analytica's head of operations in Mexico, previously denied the firm's involvement in the elections, saying that they were working exclusively on commercial affairs.\n\nHowever, another investigation by BuzzFeed News showed that Karro had been scouting for data analysts to work on a project related to the presidential elections.\n\n\"We are the brains behind the Trump Election, the Nelson Mandela Election, and will be the brains behind the Mexican Presidential Election,\" Karro wrote in a LinkedIn message.\n\nIn an Oct. 23 Facebook post to the page 'Foreigners in Mexico City,' ahead of governor elections, executives of Cambridge's Mexican branch such as Arielle Dale Karro were also reportedly in contact with members of the conservative National Action Party, including Senator Ernesto Cordero.\n\nCambridge Analytica worked in Mexico with a data collection app called Pig.gi, which offers free internet to users in exchange for personal information, viewing sponsored publicity and answering surveys.\n\n\"Pig.gi has already been hugely successful in Mexico and Colombia,\" said Nix last year in a communique, when the app recorded 200,000 users. \"We're thrilled to be partnering with the app so that their partners can get the right message to the right people at the right time.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica's vice president told Bloomberg last year that the partnership was transparently designed to influence the votes of younger Mexicans: Mexico's general election is due on July 1.\n\nPig.gi has about one million users and is popular among middle and lower classes in Mexico and Colombia, who rarely have internet access at home.\n\n\"People that can change an election in Mexico are those millennials living in poor rural or urban areas, and that's why they're giving away Wi-Fi: that's where they get their intelligence from,\" said Javier Murillo, director of Metrics Digital, a digital technology consulting firm.\n\nColombia blocked Pig.gi access on March 28, preventing it from interfering in the upcoming presidential elections, but Mexican authorities have yet to take any direct action.\n\nThe details of Cambridge Analytica's involvement in the 2018 Mexican presidential elections are not yet known, but if it worked with the ruling PRI, it might not have done a great job.\n\nPRI's candidate Jose Antonio Meade is currently third in the polls, close to right-wing Ricardo Anaya and far behind Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is leading all surveys with more than 40 percent of the vote intention.\n\nMexico's campaign period kicked off on Friday, after an in-between period in which candidates had to restrict their comments and publicity. When the campaign period starts, political parties, their coalitions and independent candidates will use broadcast time on radio and TV, street banners and all they have at hand to ask citizens to vote for them.",

La respuesta la tiene el INE y se llama tope de campaña.\n\nEn octubre del año pasado, esa institución comunicó que lo máximo que podrían gastar los participantes en esta elección presidencial serían 429.6 millones de pesos, unos 22 millones de dólares.\n\nUna firma como CA no cobraría menos de tres millones de dólares por sus artes de segmentación y estrategia, sin contar todos los demás gastos de publicidad y la ejecución de las tácticas de campaña.\n\nA ningún partido le convendría gastar 14 por ciento de su presupuesto sólo en redes sociales, ya que lo podría llevar a rebasar rápidamente el tope de campaña.\n\nSí, CA es cara. No es casualidad que la firma que impulsó a Trump entre la preferencia de los votantes en 2016 formó parte de una de las votaciones más caras en la historia de ese país: costó alrededor de siete mil millones de dólares, según datos del Center for Responsive Politics (CRP).\n\nAhora bien, yo le diría a cualquier candidato que mejor guarde su dinero. Para ganar esta elección en México se necesita mucho más que un CA.\n\nNación321 difundió la tercera edición de la encuesta #VotoMillennial el pasado 1 de abril y encontró que ese segmento tiene como favorito a Andrés Manuel López Obrador para ocupar la presidencia con 51 por ciento de intención de voto efectivo.\n\nLa cifra fue recabada en el arranque de las campañas, cuando, por cierto, se notó la coordinación precisa de los bots y seguidores de José Antonio Meade (candidato del PRI), a quienes llamamos PRIennials. En su discurso inaugural se lanzaron -prácticamente como un solo clic- 20 mil tuits con el hashtag #YoConMeade. Lo convirtieron en primer trending topic de México en un parpadeo.\n\nLos PRIennials son rápidos, organizados y precisos. Una operación muy bien orquestada.\n\nPero el gusto fue pasajero. Los AMLOvers (los seguidores activistas de López Obrador) poco a poco fueron colocando #AMLOPresidente entre los favoritos, hasta llegar al número uno y permaneció ahí durante varias horas, alimentado por bots que atacaban más de lo que lo aplaudían, sí, pero también por los ciudadanos hablando del candidato… a favor y en contra. Los AMLOvers son resistentes, elocuentes y persistentes.\n\nPara ganar esta elección se requiere mucho más que un CA porque habrá que convencer a los millennials, que son activistas digitales, a que salgan a votar a la urna real el día de los comicios y a ellos esta acción podría no parecerles tan relevante.\n\nAsí que hasta el momento, nada está escrito.

    "article_text": "Te presentamos algunas de las compañías mexicanas que están jugando por un pedazo del mercado de 60,000 mdd.\n\nCIUDAD DE MÉXICO (Liliana Corona) -\n\nEl mercado de Inteligencia Artificial tendrá un valor de casi 60,000 millones de dólares para 2026, de acuerdo con Statista, lo que representa una gran oportunidad de negocio.\n\nLas compañías mexicanas ya se han incorporado en la tendencia, que desde hace más o menos un año hizo boom en México, y buscan obtener una tajada de esa gran cifra.\n\nTe presentamos a algunas de ellas.\n\nMetrics\n\nDesde 2011, Metrics, una compañía que nació como consultora desarrolló su primera solución basada en inteligencia artificial.\n\n“Ya teníamos la idea de integrar inteligencia artificial y realizar chatbots pero para ese entonces la tecnología resultaba cara”, señala Javier Murillo, fundador de Metrics.\n\nEl primer paso de la tecnológica mexicana fue desarrollar bots o robots que automatizaban contenido. Es decir, estos robots tomaban contenido, lo reestructuraban y fabricaban piezas de contenido, tuits o posts para diferentes plataformas sociales.\n\nEsta tecnología de automatización fue integrada también en los procesos de creación de reportes que desarrollaban para sus clientes.\n\nEn ese momento logró atraer la mirada de sus clientes para sumar esta tecnología a sus procesos de análisis de datos y predicción de tendencias en tiempo real. Fue en ese momento cuando Metrics vendió su primera oferta tecnológica a una compañía.\n\n“La tecnología que ofrecíamos pasó de voz en voz y en meses ya éramos un jugador”, agregó el fundador y director de la empresa.\n\nLa anticipación a esta tecnología le permitió a Metrics adelantarse a soluciones que posteriormente empresas de gran tamaño, como Facebook y Microsoft, confirmaron.\n\nHoy en día la tecnología de Metrics Digital es tan sofisticada que puede definir la actitud de una discusión.\n\n“Desde 2014 empezamos a crear algoritmos con una capacidad de 97% de indicar qué actitud tiene una persona hacia cierto tema”, puntualizó Murillo. “Con esta medición podemos determinar si existe un riesgo o una oportunidad en tiempo real”, agregó.\n\nEste hecho le llevó a Metrics a desarrollar un chatbot que tiene la capacidad de determinar a través del lenguaje escrito si el usuario o cliente se encuentra feliz, enojado o indiferente y abordar un protocolo de atención dependiendo del estado de éste.\n\nLa tecnología de chatbot de Metrics es usada, por ejemplo, por firmas como Manpower para el perfilamiento de empleados. Hoy la compañía tiene 30 proyectos de inteligencia artificial.\n\nLee: Publicidad tradicional tiene un nuevo rival: la inteligencia artificial\n\nYalo\n\nFundada por Javier Mata, Yalo se consolida como uno de los pocos socios de Facebook en la región para la creación de chatbots a través de sus plataformas, desarrollando bots para compañías de todos sectores, desde aerolíneas hasta restaurantes.\n\n“Nuestro objetivo es cómo podemos hacer igual de fácil la interacción entre los negocios a como lo es interactuar con tus amigos. No es el típico robot que no tiene una personalidad y que tiene un tacto frío”, mencionó Mata en una entrevista publicada en la revista Expansión.\n\nRecientemente Yalo extendió también la atención a clientes a partir de chatbots en WhatsApp. Aeroméxico se convirtió en la primera aerolínea Latinoamérica en extender su atención a la aplicación de mensajería que hoy cuenta con más de 1,200 millones de usuarios.\n\nLa ventaja de tener un chatbot, destacó Mata, es la atención al cliente las 24 horas los siete días de la semana.\n\nEl chatbot de Aeroméxico, por ejemplo, es capaz de realizar cotizaciones de vuelo, reservas, responder preguntas e incluso notificar al usuario sobre la sala asignada, entre otras cosas.\n\nLee: Los nuevos trabajadores necesitan adapatarse a la llegada de AI: IBM y Salesforce\n\nNearshore Delivery Solutions\n\nCon más de 7 años en el mercado mexicano dedicándose al desarrollo de tecnología y captación y exportación de talento mexicano en cibernética, Nearshore no es precisamente un jugador nuevo.\n\nAl trabajar con firmas estadounidense desde hace más de un lustro, empezaron a desarrollar tecnología en cómputo cognitivo hace cerca de 3 años, cuando se empezó a convertir en tendencia en Estados Unidos.\n\nAhora desarrollan tecnologías propias como la plataforma riesgocognitivo.com, que usa la inteligencia artificial para realizar estimados de los movimientos que tendrán las bolsas de valores de acuerdo con diversos factores.\n\nAdemás, fundaron la Asociación Iberoamericana de Cómputo Cognitivo, para regular a las empresas que se dedican al desarrollo y venta de estas tecnologías.\n\n“Muchas empresas se quejaban de que, bajo el nombre Inteligencia Artificial, les vendían gato por liebre a costos altísimos”, explica Gustavo Parés, CEO de la empresa mexicana.\n\nActualmente, sus principales clientes en México pertenecen a finanzas, retail y telecom.\n\n",

    "article_text": "A database of approximately 593,000 Alaska voter records has been exposed online.\n\nTargetSmart, the company that owns the data, claims that it was not accessed by anyone other than the security researchers on their team and the team that identified the exposure.\n\nTom Bonier, the Chief Executive Officer of TargetSmart, confirmed the breach and said in a statement that Equals3, a software company based in Minnesota, “Appears to have failed to secure some of their data and some data they license from TargetSmart.”\n\n“None of the exposed TargetSmart data included any personally-identifiable non-public financial data,” said Bonier.\n\nEquals3 CEO Dan Mallin said, \"Yesterday, a security researcher who specifically looks for vulnerabilities like this gained unauthorized access to the records of 20 Alaskans. No other records were accessed by any other individuals and we immediately shut down access to the data.\"\n\nMallin said a short while ago that Equals3, \"Immediately shut down the server and contacted a third-party security firm to execute an intrusion test.\"\n\nWhen asked whether Equals3 would continue working with TargetSmart, Mallin said: \"TargetSmart is a valued partner and we worked hand-in-hand to ensure swift resolution.\"\n\nBonier spoke about the obligations of third-parties with data: \"TargetSmart imposes strict contractual obligations on its clients regarding how TargetSmart data must be stored and secured, and takes these obligations seriously,\" said Bonier.\n\nJospehine H. Bahnke, the director of Alaska Division of Elections, says this was not a breach of the Alaska voter registration database: “It was a breach of a private research company’s system which leveraged the public information provided in voter lists with other information it was collecting from other sources. We have not heard from the research folks or anyone on this subject directly. That said, as was reported the site is no longer up, and state resources are investigating the matter,” said Bahnke.\n\nJay Parmley, the executive director of the Alaska Democratic Party, confirms it has used TargetSmart as a data vendor for “several years” through their affiliation with the Association of State Democratic Chairs.\n\n“We might use them to understand the electorate by purchasing or matching data if you will. It could be a list, it could be a segment of voters, the voter file itself, all the registered voters - It’s pretty much a data enhancement,” said Parmley.\n\nSome of the data TargetSmart matches with the Alaska Democratic Party includes phone numbers and addresses but it can also include household incomes.\n\nParmley explains the data has to be publicly available through organizations such as the Division of Elections or available in the common market.\n\nHousehold income is self-reported, often through online surveys that are unrelated to politics, and then sold to companies like TargetSmart, Parmley said.\n\n“That’s why you need to read the fine print, it could be sold by that vendor. They disclose that to you by really small print at the bottom of the page,” Parmley said.\n\nParmley said he was set to speak to TargetSmart about the breach but the Alaska Democratic Party would “absolutely” work with them again.\n\n“We have had the highest of confidence in their ability and quite frankly in their data integrity and any breach like the one that happened today, would be the first time we’ve seen this happened,” said Parmley.\n\n“We take people’s private information extraordinarily safely,” said Parmley.\n\nParmley described that the purpose of the data is often to campaign more efficiently by not sending information to people who never vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Josh Walton, the Executive Director of the Alaska Republican Party, says they do not contract with TargetSmart but get their voter information through the Republican National Committee.\n\nWalton says he understands the RNC compiles their information in-house.\n\nKTUU reached out to the security research firm which is believed to have discovered the breach, it has not immediately responded for comment.",

    "article_text": "Im Wahlkampf gibt es zwei verfeindete Lager: Nein, nicht die Parteien, sondern die Planer ihrer Kampagnen. Die einen setzen vor allem auf Daten, die anderen wollen starke Geschichten für die Wähler inszenieren. Wer hat recht?\n\nArun Chaudhary steht auf einer Bühne in der Factory, einem Startup-Zentrum in Berlin, und erklärt dem in der Maihitze schwitzenden Publikum, wie man Wahlen gewinnt. Die Campaign Tech Europe ist eine Konferenz für die neuesten Digitalstrategien und Kampagnentechnologien, vor Chaudhary sitzen etwa 150 Werber und wollen sich von ihm erzählen lassen, wie man den anarchistischen digitalen Raum erobert. „Digital, das ist kein Wettrüsten“, sagt Chaudhary. „Es geht nicht um Daten oder Follower.“ Wie Facebook funktioniere? Völlig egal! Wie bitte? Es braucht schon Eier, von der Bühne aus die Arbeit seiner Zuhörer – die sich ausschließlich mit digitalen Strategien im Wahlkampf, mit Kampagnentechnologien, Datenanalyse und Targeting beschäftigen – dermaßen frontal anzugreifen.\n\nDabei ist der Mann, der hier die Digitalisierung scheut und den progressiven Kids die Ideen madig redet, ein alter Branchenhase. Chaudhary, Vizepräsident der jungen Strategieagentur Revolution Messaging, wirkt in seinen viel zu locker sitzenden, ausgebeulten Jeans und mit der nestartigen Frisur auf seinem Kopf wie der junge Maurice Moss aus „IT Crowd“. Aber der Erfolg gibt Chaudhary die Autorität, so über den digitalen Wahlkampf zu reden: Der 41-Jährige war eine Schlüsselfigur der New-Media-Kampagne in Barack Obamas Wahlkampf um die Präsidentschaft 2008. Im vergangenen Jahr verantwortete er als Creative Director die viel beachtete Kampagne von Bernie Sanders. In Zeiten, in denen Wahlen immer komplexer werden, in denen es Dutzende Kanäle mit extrem unterschiedlichem Publikum gibt, in einer Welt, in der jeder kleinste Fehler bis in den letzten Winkel des Landes gefunkt wird, in dieser Welt ist Chaudhary einer der Menschen, ohne die man keine Wahl mehr gewinnen kann: Der Macher hinter den Machern, ein Alchemist der Algorithmen – aber keiner, der glaubt, nur weil man heute so viele Zahlen und Daten über Wähler zur Verfügung hat, dass das allein schon zum Sieg führt.\n\nAuch Frank Stauss ist ein Mann, der an Geschichten glaubt. Man muss Stauss nicht kennen, aber er steht hinter Namen, die den Menschen mehrere Jahre lang im Gedächtnis bleiben. In deutschen Wahlkämpferkreisen genießt er leisen Legendenstatus abseits einer allzu großen Öffentlichkeit. Beobachtern gilt Stauss wahlweise als besessenes Genie und Wahlkampfguru, dann wieder als kühler Stratege, der „Taktik meilenweit riechen“ kann. So hat ihn Claus Kleber einmal im ZDF anmoderiert. Vor allem ist Stauss ein Mann, der keine Politik macht; Stauss verkauft Politik. Er ist Werber und Wahlkämpfer, Mitinhaber der Berliner Werbeagentur Butter und seit 20 Jahren die Geheimwaffe der SPD.\n\nDezent platzierte Erfolge\n\nIn Stauss’ Berliner Büro deutet nichts darauf hin, dass dies der Ort ist, wo das Telefon oft dann klingelt, wenn es brennt. Wenn ein Sieg vielleicht sogar unmöglich scheint und es nur noch darum geht, das Ergebnis zu verbessern. Im Büro stehen überall kleine Zeugen von Stauss’ Erfolgen: Preise, Fotos, Bücher. Vor der Tür herrscht ruhige Geschäftigkeit, ein paar Rollkragenpullis und Kassengestelle sitzen vereinzelt in den großzügig geschnittenen, loftartigen Räumen herum. Einrichtung: typischer Berliner Startup-Minimalismus. Stauss, groß, schlank, kahl, empfängt auf einer Ledercouch, schräg gegenüber zwei Sessel mit Tisch, ein Bücherregal in der Ecke. Sein Bestseller von 2013 über seinen Wahlkampf mit Gerhard Schröder, „Höllenritt Wahlkampf“, liegt gekonnt zufällig rum. An der Wand ein Bild von ihm mit Al Gore, bei dem er 1991 als Fulbright-Stipendiat hospitierte. Im Jahr darauf dann Mitarbeit an der erfolgreichen Präsidentschaftskampagne Clinton und Gore.\n\nWas also ist der Trick, wie kriegt man Menschen dazu, einen Politiker zu wählen? „Habe einen guten Grund, weshalb die Leute dich wählen sollen“, sagt Stauss und klingt wahnsinnig lapidar. „Wenn du dir die Wahlkampagnen dieser Welt ansiehst, bleiben am Ende die erfolglos, die diese Frage nicht beantworten können, oder der Kandidat hat sie nicht für sich beantwortet.“ Kann das wirklich alles sein, worauf es ankommt? Gutes Storytelling?\n\nWozu Parolen?\n\nFallbeispiel eins: die zunächst hoffnungslose SPD-Spitzenkandidatin Malu Dreyer, der 2016 im Landtagswahlkampf in Rheinland-Pfalz eine spektakuläre Aufholjagd über zehn Prozentpunkte gelang und damit der Sieg. Bei Dreyer, erzählt Stauss, war es die Haltung der Kandidatin, die zur Geschichte wurde. „Die Wahl fand ja in einer aufgeheizten Atmosphäre statt. Als dann irgendwann alle gesagt haben, du musst jetzt auch härter werden gegen die Flüchtlinge und mehr über innere Sicherheit sprechen, da hat sie einfach gegengehalten – und Prügel bezogen ohne Ende. Aber das hat am Ende alle progressiven Kräfte so mobilisiert, dass sie mehr Stimmen aus dem Nichtwählerlager gewonnen hat, als an die AfD verloren wurden.“ Weil sich die anständigen Wähler mit Dreyer identifiziert haben? „Weil die Leute gesagt haben: Für die Dreyer steh ich jetzt auf.“",

    "article_text": "Der Bundestagswahlkampf hat begonnen und damit die Debatten über die Rolle von Technologie und Daten im Kontext politischer Kampagnen. Vergangene Woche fand die erste \"Campaign Tech Europe\"-Konferenz in Berlin statt, auf welcher Kampagnenexperten aus den Vereinigten Staaten und Europa über die Veränderungs- und Gestaltungsmacht von Technologie in Wahlkämpfen diskutierten. Den kontextuellen Rahmen dieser Debatte prägen dabei drei zentrale Herausforderungen, vor denen Parteien im Bundestagswahlkampf 2017 stehen:\n\nDie erste Herausforderung besteht in der Disruption des politischen Meinungs- und Willensbildungsprozesses. Der Begriff Disruption ist in diesem Zusammenhang als eine Unterbrechung der etablierten Handlungslogik eines Systems, Prozesses oder Ereignisses zu definieren. Auf der systemischen Ebene verdeutlichen das beispielsweise der Brexit oder die Wahl von Donald Trump und Emmanuel Macron – in den genannten Fällen haben sich neue politische Akteure und Kräfte durchsetzen können.\n\nGleichzeitig ist auf der Prozessebene von Politik festzustellen, dass sich das Mediennutzungsverhalten und damit die Informationsgewinnung zur Meinungsbildung verstärkt ins Netz verlagert hat. Diese technologiebasierte Disruption ist anhand der vieldiskutierten Filterblasen beziehungsweise Echokammern und der daraus resultierenden Bedeutung von \"Fake News\" sowie Social Bots nachzuvollziehen.\n\nDie Bedeutung von Plattformen wie Facebook als Ort der Informationsgewinnung und -verlinkung für die politische Meinungsbildung stellt Wahlkampfstrategen und Kandidaten vor die Herausforderung, ihre Inhalte und Kommunikationsstrategien an die Darstellungs- und Hierarchisierungslogik von Algorithmen anzupassen. Folgt man dem amerikanischen Internetaktivisten Ethan Zuckermann, dann werden in weniger als zehn Jahren nicht mehr Parteien und Politiker das Machtzentrum von politisch kommunikativem Handeln und Entscheiden sein, sondern Plattformen.\n\nDie zweite Herausforderung, der sich Parteien im Wahlkampf stellen müssen, bildet die Grundlage für die genannte Machtverschiebung: die Fragmentierung der Öffentlichkeit als Normalzustand für politische Kommunikation in Wahlkämpfen. Die Erosion der Deutungshoheit und kommunikativen Souveränität von Kandidaten, Parteien und Medien ist darauf zurückzuführen, dass Algorithmen auf Plattformen als Gatekeeper fungieren. Jeder einzelne Facebook-Newsfeed bildet eine auf den Nutzer und seine Interessen spezifizierte Mikroöffentlichkeit, welche nicht länger über eine überschaubare Anzahl an TV- und Radio-Sendern sowie Zeitungen erreicht werden kann. Nur wer die Darstellungs- und Hierarchisierungslogik von Algorithmen versteht, wird die Deutungshoheit in Wahlkämpfen erlangen können.\n\nDie dritte Herausforderung besteht in der Kampagnenfähigkeit von Parteien und Strategen als Resultat der Disruption der Meinungsbildung und der Fragmentierung der allgemeinen Öffentlichkeit. Zunächst müssen Parteien und Kandidaten damit aufhören, nur selbstreferenziell über politisches Handeln im Netz zu sprechen. Vielmehr ist es entscheidend, Unterstützer und Wähler in das Zentrum der Kommunikation zu stellen, diese fortlaufend zu involvieren und Mitmachmöglichkeiten zu bieten. Menschen fungieren im Netz nicht in erster Linie als Informationsempfänger von Wahlwerbung, sondern sollten vielmehr als potenzielle Träger von Botschaften und Multiplikatoren für die Werte sowie Ziele der Kampagne verstanden werden. Die Herausforderung besteht darin, mit einem \"one-to-one\"-Kommunikationsansatz personalisierte politische Kommunikation für spezifische Zielgruppen zu entwickeln, zu testen, Schlussfolgerungen zu ziehen, um diese anzupassen oder zu skalieren.\n\nZusammenfassend ist es für die Kampagnenfähigkeit von entscheidender Bedeutung, Daten nicht nur als ein Produkt kommunikativen Handelns zu begreifen, sondern als strategische Handlungsressource, um die eigene Kommunikation deutlich effizienter und effektiver zu gestalten. Dies bedeutet in der Konsequenz, dass jede Interaktion mit dem potenziellen Wähler auch einen Erkenntnisgewinn über dessen individuelle Präferenzen liefert, was dabei hilft, eine personalisierte Kampagnenerfahrung zu ermöglichen.\n\nEs muss Kampagnenmachern gelingen, ein \"data first-mindset\" zu entwickeln, um datenbasiert Entscheidungen in Wahlkämpfen zu treffen, ganz gleich ob bei der digitalen Kommunikation, bei der Planung von Infoständen oder dem Tür-zu-Tür-Wahlkampf. Im Zuge der digitalen Transformation können Wahlkämpfe nur gewonnen werden, wenn ein Momentum und eine Bewegung für eine Partei oder einen Kandidaten im Netz entsteht. Der Erfolg hängt davon ab, wie Unterstützer und Wähler mittels Daten befähigt werden, selbst in einer Kampagne aktiv zu werden.",

    "article_text": "A Latin American mobile app that Cambridge Analytica had hoped to use to mine data for Mexican presidential campaigns has severed ties with the embattled political-advertising firm after the Facebook Inc. data scandal erupted.\n\nPig.gi, which gives 1.2 million users in Mexico and Colombia free airtime and data in exchange for watching ads and taking surveys, says it’s never worked on a political campaign with Cambridge. The startup did share results on two election polls and occasional aggregated data on non-political preferences, but said it does so with other partners as well.\n\n“In light of the recent allegations, we have taken steps to formally, completely end any kind of commercial relationship with them,” Pig.gi founder and Chief Executive Officer Joel Phillips told Bloomberg. “Obviously, if we could look back and see how this would progress, we would have said ‘no, this is probably not the best people to take money from.’”\n\nThe data firm that helped elect U.S. President Donald Trump is caught up in investigations in several countries after allegedly obtaining the private data of 50 million Facebook users, triggering a backlash from consumers around the globe. The furor spread to Mexico when Cambridge executives bragged to hidden cameras from Britain’s Channel 4 that they operated in the country.\n\nCambridge told Bloomberg last summer it was scouting for a Mexican presidential candidate whose campaign it could join ahead of July elections. Then-vice president of business development, Brittany Kaiser, told Bloomberg she hoped to use data mined from Pig.gi to help a Mexican candidate and client. But in December, the executive said Cambridge was just managing commercial clients in Latin America and was no longer seeking political customers. Kaiser, who has left the consultancy, declined to comment.\n\nDebate over Cambridge’s activity in Mexico has become front-page news in a country that’s immersed in a contentious election, and where corruption scandals, vote-buying accusations and reports of spying have long been part of the landscape. Local media have sought to uncover whether the big-data firm worked with Mexican political parties. Lorenzo Cordova, who heads Mexican electoral regulator INE, said Wednesday he has no knowledge of Cambridge’s domestic operations.\n\n“They probably had a lot of ambitions to do a lot of things, but as far as I know I don’t know if anything ever materialized,” said Pig.gi’s Phillips. He stressed that no personal data would ever have found its way to Cambridge. The data firm’s plans to develop algorithms for Pig.gi, or to acquire information about candidates, never panned out, he added.\n\nPhillips acknowledged Cambridge still holds about 1 percent of Pig.gi. His brother and co-founder Isaac said however the app had decided to stop publishing presidential poll results in Mexico and Colombia, after discovering it needed to register with regulators to do so.\n\n“We don’t want to get involved in politics,” Phillips said. Politics “in Latin America is very divisive, very explosive here, potentially.”",

The app has more than a million downloads in Colombia and Mexico combined, the regulator said.\n\nThe app, which users download via the Google Play store and sign into using their Facebook account, is administered by Farrow Colombia S.A.S and Farrow Mexico S.A.P.I. de CV, the statement said.\n\nAttempts to reach Farrow for comment were unsuccessful. A number listed for Farrow in Colombia belongs to another company. There is no listed number for the Mexico branch of the company.\n\n“As a preventative measure and taking into account the potential risk of a wrongful and massive illegal use of the personal data of thousands of Colombians collected via the download of the Pig.gi application, the application Pig.gi is temporarily blocked while appropriate investigations are undertaken and definitive decisions adopted,” the regulator said.\n\nThe regulator did not specify what evidence it had of a connection between Cambridge Analytica and Farrow. The application will be blocked on the Google Play app store and on social media, as will websites where it can be downloaded.\n\nThe regulator added it has requested cooperation and information from its counterparts in the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and Mexico.\n\nFacebook announced a series of changes on Wednesday to give users more control over their data, after the scandal wiped more than $100 billion from its stock market value.\n\nCambridge Analytica has said it did not use Facebook data in U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign, and that it had deleted all Facebook data it obtained from a third-party app in 2014 after learning the information did not adhere to data protection rules.\n\nColombia will hold presidential elections on May 27.",

    "article_text": "Facebook has been rocked by reports of a massive data scrape carried out by Cambridge Analytica and one of its then-contractors, a Cambridge University academic named Aleksandr Kogan. Kogan claims that the data he collected from thousands of Facebook users and their friends—amounting to data on over 50 million users—abided by Facebook’s terms; Cambridge Analytica promises it deleted the data; and Facebook is auditing everyone it can for signs of the data.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut while Facebook provided the original data, it wasn’t the only vehicle for Kogan’s app. Kogan acquired what he wanted from individual people—over 240,000 over a six-month period—recruiting them and paying them for their quiz answers and data using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk micro-work platform and Qualtrics, a survey platform. The two platforms are often used by companies to conduct experiments and surveys and by academic researchers to, for instance, recruit psychology subjects. Research ethics require that scientists only gather people’s data for specified uses with their explicit consent, and Amazon’s polices prohibit tasks from harvesting people’s Facebook data. At the time, multiple survey-takers took to a message board, Turkopticon, to report the quiz for violating of Amazon’s Terms of Service. The company eventually booted Kogan from its platform in 2015–over a year later–after learning from a Guardian article that he had passed the data to Cambridge Analytica. But Kogan’s new company, Philometrics, continues to post questionnaires to Mechanical Turk, according to Turkopticon. Kogan’s collaborator on the Cambridge Analytica project, Joe Chancellor, also still uses the platform; according to one review website, he posted a task on Mechanical Turk in February. Kogan, who remains a research associate in Cambridge University’s psychology department, and Chancellor, who now works at Facebook Research, did not respond to requests for comment. When pressed for more details, an Amazon Web Services spokesperson responded, “Our terms of service clearly prohibit misuse. We suspended the Mechanical Turk requester in 2015 for violating our terms of service.” (This is the same statement Amazon gave to reporters Matthias Schwartz and Cora Currier at The Intercept in March of last year.)\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmazon wouldn’t provide more details, including how many people Kogan recruited on MTurk, or whether it attempted to notify those users after it learned of Cambridge Analytica’s role in 2015. “Sorry Cale, nothing more to add at this time,” the spokesperson said. Qualtrics has not disclosed if it took any steps to review Kogan’s work. A spokesperson for the company said, “Qualtrics takes data privacy and security very seriously. Customers, not Qualtrics, own their data. All data are safeguarded using industry best security practices that prevent unlawful disclosure.” How The Data Harvest Worked In early 2014, Kogan, a lecturer at Cambridge University, cofounded a company, Global Science Research, for the purpose of working with Cambridge Analytica on a project to collect data on as many Americans as possible. The personality quizzes–and the associated data-harvesting Facebook app–first appeared that spring on Mechanical Turk. MTurk, as it’s known, is an online marketplace where human workers (called “turkers”) can earn small amounts of money for completing individual “human intelligence tasks” (HITs)–like taking a survey and connecting it with your personal Facebook profile. Kogan and Chancellor also turned to the survey platform Qualtrics, spending around $800,000 to pay users who took their quizzes (and turned over their data), according to the New York Times. Generally, the task offered to pay turkers $1 to $2 dollars apiece once they completed the quiz and handed over access to their Facebook data. Technically, neither MTurk nor Qualtrics allow integrations that let survey respondents connect to users’ Facebook data. It’s likely, however, that Kogan recruited users using these platforms and then sent them a link to the external Facebook app, which then connected him with Facebook’s Open API. From a base of approximately 270,000 users, Kogan took advantage of a then-widely used feature in the Facebook API, which allowed him to harvest data from their friends too; by the time the project was finished, over 50 million users’ data had been downloaded, with over 34 million profiles “usable” for psychometric research. Facebook would completely close access to friends’ data in May 2015.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAttached to one of the tasks it sent out in 2014, Global Science Research and Cambridge Analytica added a few specific requirements. First, GSR and Cambridge Analytica were only interested in Americans. Second, “turkers” wouldn’t be paid until they authorized the Facebook app to “…give us permission to download some data from your Facebook. We will download (a) some of your demographic data, (b) your likes, (c) your friend’s list, (d) whether each of your friends knows one another, (e) the likes of your friends and their demographics, and (f) some of your private messages…” (Research shows the average Facebook user then had about 340 friends.) Not long after the surveys started to appear, a few of the “turkers” began to realize that the Global Science Research app was taking advantage of Facebook’s gray data supply chain. “Someone can learn everything about you by looking at hundreds of pics, messages, friends, and likes,” warned one “turker.” MTurk’s acceptable use policy expressly forbids this. Prohibited activities include: “Collecting personally identifiable information (e.g., don’t ask Workers for their email address or phone number)”\n\n“Advertising or marketing activities, including HITs requiring registration at another website or group”\n\n“Posting HITs on behalf of third parties without our prior written consent” On Turkopticon, Kogan has more than a hundred reviews for various tasks, posted both by his account, from at least February 2014 to May 2014, and by his company’s account, from June 2014 to December 2015. But in February 2014 and again in May 2014, a flurry of negative reviews reported that Kogan had violated the Amazon Turk Terms of Service. In May 2014 one user wrote:\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nAfter 15 minutes of working on the survey –answering all the questions and then providing my demographic data — the survey then asks to access my Facebook account by having me log in collecting personal identifiable information… This is against AMT policy, which includes: “collecting personal identifiable information” as an example of a prohibited activity. Also, the survey was carelessly done, which makes me believe it’s all a setup to collect information about a person for really cheap. At least nine people on the message board reported Kogan and Global Science Research for violating Amazon’s rules. But he continued posting various research surveys until December 2015, when Amazon said it banned him from the platform. After recent reporting by The Guardian and The Times, Facebook banned Kogan and Cambridge Analytica from its platform pending an investigation. The company said Kogan previously claimed that the data his app was scraping was being used for academic purposes. Kogan, who has agreed to an audit, has said that Facebook “at no point raised any concerns at all” about the app or an updated description of it that detailed its commercial, rather than academic, use. He also said that when Facebook asked him to delete the data in 2015, he did. Kogan told the BBC last week that he was “being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.” Offloading Responsibility Rochelle LaPlante, an MTurk worker and advocate, said the scandal highlighted issues with the way Amazon addressed abuse on its platform. Amazon, she said, doesn’t thoroughly check out the people who recruit turkers, instead relying on people like her to turn in those whose tasks go against the platform’s terms of service, she said. “This puts responsibility onto individual workers to be familiar enough with the Terms of Service that the platform requesters must agree to,” she told Fast Company over email. “It relies on workers to know what to report and when, and to take on the labor of sending these reports to Amazon.” Related: The Network Uber Drivers Built\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhat’s more, says LaPlante, Amazon rarely gives Turkers feedback about reports they have submitted or follow up on them in any way, “so we never know if our reports are read or if action is taken or how quickly (or not) any of that happens.” In regards to Kogan, LaPlante wonders why he was able to make multiple MTurk accounts and continue posting requests for work even after he was initially terminated. How many others, like Kogan, have used these freelancer platforms for this kind of participation—and this kind of data harvesting—in exchange for a small compensation? One user on the subreddit MTurk writes about Cambridge Analytica, “This firm definitely isn’t unique and I’m sure there are worse abusers that will never get noticed.” LaPlante says there are many tasks on MTurk that ask for people to log into Facebook, or something similar. And it’s difficult to know exactly where that data is going. “These are clear violations of the MTurk Terms of Service and we report them to Amazon when we see them. But again, we have no way on the worker side to know if Amazon ever takes action against those,” she says. “If the researcher is suspended for a TOS violation, it’s quite possible the researcher still gets their project completed before Amazon gets around to taking a look at the reports, since popular HITs are often done within a few hours (or less).” LaPlante said the company needs to be more transparent, echoing calls increasingly heard around Silicon Valley and the data industry. “I do wonder why we have yet to see a recent statement from Amazon about their involvement,” says LaPlante There are many questions that still surround the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica controversy, and many lessons too. Among them: If tech companies can’t police themselves, they must share more of their internal data with researchers, journalists, and the public. It’s a demand that people have been making of Facebook and other companies for years, with varying and mostly dismal success. If they want to maintain the integrity of their platforms–and their users’ trust–any company that helps to amplify the misuse of our data will need to find ways to turn over some of their own data too.\n\nadvertisement",

    "article_text": "How do 87m records scraped from Facebook become an advertising campaign that could help swing an election? What does gathering that much data actually involve? And what does that data tell us about ourselves?\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal has raised question after question, but for many, the technological USP of the company, which announced last week that it was closing its operations, remains a mystery.\n\nFor those 87 million people probably wondering what was actually done with their data, I went back to Christopher Wylie, the ex-Cambridge Analytica employee who blew the whistle on the company’s problematic operations in the Observer. According to Wylie, all you need to know is a little bit about data science, a little bit about bored rich women, and a little bit about human psychology...\n\nStep one, he says, over the phone as he scrambles to catch a train: “When you’re building an algorithm, you first need to create a training set.” That is: no matter what you want to use fancy data science to discover, you first need to gather the old-fashioned way. Before you can use Facebook likes to predict a person’s psychological profile, you need to get a few hundred thousand people to do a 120-question personality quiz.\n\nThe “training set” refers, then, to that data in its entirety: the Facebook likes, the personality tests, and everything else you want to learn from. Most important, it needs to contain your “feature set”: “The underlying data that you want to make predictions on,” Wylie says. “In this case, it’s Facebook data, but it could be, for example, text, like natural language, or it could be clickstream data” – the complete record of your browsing activity on the web.“Those are all the features that you want to [use to] predict.”\n\nAt the other end, you need your “target variables” – in Wylie’s words, “the things that you’re trying to predict for. So in this case, personality traits or political orientation, or what have you.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest You can create messaging that doesn’t make sense to some people but makes so much sense to other people’: Christopher Wylie. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nIf you’re trying to use one thing to predict another, it helps if you can look at both at the same time. “If you want to know the relationships between Facebook likes in your feature set and personality traits as your target variables, you need to see both,” says Wylie.\n\nFacebook data, which lies at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica story, is a fairly plentiful resource in the data science world – and certainly was back in 2014, when Wylie first started working in this area. Personality traits are much harder to get hold of: despite what the proliferation of BuzzFeed quizzes might suggest, it takes quite a lot to persuade someone to fill in a 120-question survey (the length of the short version of one of the standard psychological surveys, the Ipip-Neo).\n\n“Quite a lot” is relative, however. “For some people, the incentive to take a survey is financial. If you’re a student or looking for work or just want to make $5, that’s an incentive.” The actual money handed over, Wylie says, “ranged from $2 to $4”. The higher payments go to “groups that were harder to get”. The group least likely to take a survey, and so earning the most from it, were African American men. “Other people take surveys just because they find it interesting, or they are bored. So we over-sampled wealthy white women. Because if you live in the Hamptons and have nothing to do in the afternoon, you fill out consumer research surveys.”\n\nThe personality surveys use those 120 questions to profile people along five discrete axes – the “five factors” model, popularly called the “Ocean” model after one common breakdown of the factors: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism.\n\nThat model clusters personality traits into distinctions that seem to hold across cultures and across time. So, for instance, those who describe themselves as “loud” are likely to also describe themselves as “gregarious”. If they agree with that description this year, they’re likely to agree with it next year. That cluster is likely to show up in responses in every language. And if a person responds to it negatively, there are likely to be real, noticeable differences between them and people who answer it positively.\n\nThose features of the model are what make it actually useful for profiling individuals, says Wylie – in contrast to some other popular psychological profiles such as the Myers-Briggs system. In the testing phase of the research, Facebook was barely involved. The surveys were offered on commercial data research sites – first Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform, then a specialist operator called Qualtrics. (The switch was made, Wylie says, because Amazon has the issue that “people are overfamiliar with filling out surveys” – so much so that it starts to affect your results.)\n\nA campaign advert tested by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIt was only at the very end that Facebook came into play. In order to be paid for their survey, users were required to log in to the site, and approve access to the survey app developed by Dr Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University academic whose research into personality profiling using Facebook likes provided the perfect access for the Robert Mercer-funded Cambridge Analytica to quickly get in on the field. (Kogan maintains that Cambridge Analytica assured him they were using data appropriately and says he has been “used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica”.)\n\nTo a survey user, the process was quick: “You click the app, you go on, and then it gives you the payment code.” But two very important things happened in those few seconds. First, the app harvested as much data as it could about the user who just logged on. Where the psychological profile is the target variable, the Facebook data is the “feature set”: the information a data scientist has on everyone else, which they need to use in order to accurately predict the features they really want to know.\n\nIt also provided personally identifiable information such as real name, location and contact details – something that wasn’t discoverable through the survey sites themselves. “That meant you could take the inventory and relate it to a natural person [who is] matchable to the electoral register.”\n\nSecond, the app did the same thing for all the friends of the user who installed it. Suddenly the hundreds of thousands of people who you’ve paid a couple of dollars to fill out a survey, whose personalities are a mystery, become millions of people whose Facebook profiles are an open book.\n\nThat’s where the final transformation comes in. How do you turn a few hundred thousand personality profiles into a few million? With a lot of computing power, and a massive matrix of possibilities. “Even though your sample size is 300,000 people, give or take, your feature set is like 100m across,” says Wylie. Every single Facebook “like” found in the data set becomes its own column in this enormous matrix. “Even if there is only one instance in the entire set, it’s still a feature.”\n\n“All that data was then put into an ensemble model,” Wylie says. “This is when you use different families or approaches of machine learning, because each of them will have their own strengths and weaknesses... and then they sort of vote, and then you amalgamate the results and come up with a conclusion.” This is where data science becomes more of a data art: the exact input of each approach to the overall model isn’t set in stone, and there’s no right way to do it. In the academic world, it’s sometimes called “training by grad student” – the point where the only thing to do is move forward through laborious trial and error. Still, it worked well enough, and in the end, Wylie says, “we built 253 algorithms, which meant there were 253 predictions per profiled record”. The goal was achieved: a model that could effectively take the Facebook likes of its subjects and work backwards, filling in the rest of the columns in the spreadsheet to arrive at guesses as to their personalities, political affiliations and more.\n\nBy the end of August 2014, Wylie had the first successful outputs: 2.1m profiled records, from 11 target US states, the plan being that they would be used to communicate and refine messages in Mercer and Steve Bannon-backed Republican campaigns leading up to the 2016 primaries (Wylie left before these). “What that number represents is people who not only have their Facebook data, voter data, and consumer data (which was all matched up), but also had an additional 253 predictions or scores that were then appended to their profile.”\n\nThose 253 predictions were the “secret sauce” that Cambridge Analytica claimed it could offer its customers. Using Facebook itself, advertisers are limited to broad demographic strokes, and a few narrower algorithmically determined categories – whether you like jazz music, say, or what your favourite sports team is. But with 253 further predictions, Cambridge Analytica could, Wylie says, craft adverts no one else could: a neurotic, extroverted and agreeable Democrat could be targeted with a radically different message than an emotionally stable, introverted, intellectual one, each designed to suppress their voting intention – even if the same messages, swapped around, would have the opposite effect.\n\nWylie brings up the anodyne political statement that a candidate is in favour of jobs. “Jobs in the economy is a good example because it’s a meaningless message. Everyone’s pro-jobs in the economy. So in that sense, using just the message of ‘I am in favour of jobs in the economy’, or ‘I have a plan to fix jobs in the economy’, you cannot differentiate yourself from your opponent.\n\n“But one of the things that we found was that actually when you unpack what is a job for different people, different people engage with constructs with different motivations and value sets that are interrelated with their dispositions.”\n\nWhat that means in practice is that the same blandishment can be dressed up in different language for different personalities, creating the impression of a candidate who connects with voters on an emotional level. “If you’re talking to a conscientious person” – one who ranks highly on the C part of the Ocean model – “you talk about the opportunity to succeed and the responsibility that a job gives you. If it’s an open person, you talk about the opportunity to grow as a person. Talk to a neurotic person, and you emphasise the security that it gives to my family.”\n\nThanks to the networked nature of modern campaigning, in theory all these messages can be delivered simultaneously to different groups. Towards the end of the campaign, once the messaging has settled in, they can even be automated, Mad Libs-style, with an algorithm churning through a thesaurus to find the perfect combination of words to win over different subgroups.\n\nA campaign advert tested by Cambridge Analytica. Photograph: GOP\n\nOf course, it isn’t all blandishments. One message used to boost rightwing turnout attacked same-sex marriage. “It’s funny, because this is so offensive and implicitly homophobic, but it’s a team of gays that created it,” Wylie says. “It was targeting conscientious people. It was a picture of a dictionary and it said ‘Look up marriage and get back to me’. For someone who is conscientious, it is a compelling message: a dictionary is a source of order, and a conscientious person is more deferential to structure.”\n\nAt a certain point, psychometric targeting moves into the realm of dog-whistle campaigning. Images of walls proved to be really effective in campaigning around immigration, for instance. “Conscientious people like structure, so for them, a solution to immigration should be orderly, and a wall embodied that. You can create messaging that doesn’t make sense to some people but makes so much sense to other people. If you show that image, some people wouldn’t get that that’s about immigration, and others immediately would get that.” The actual issues, for Wylie, are simply the “plain white toast” of politics, waiting for the actual flavour to be loaded on. “No one wants plain white toast.” The job of the data, he says, is to “learn the particular flavour or spice” that will make that toast appealing.\n\nWhile this was undoubtedly a highly sophisticated targeting machine, questions remain about Cambridge Analytica’s psychometric model – ones Wylie, perhaps, isn’t best placed to answer. When Kogan gave evidence to parliament in April, he suggested that it was barely better than chance at applying the right Ocean scores to individuals. Maybe that edge is enough to matter – or maybe CA was selling snake oil. And even if individuals were correctly labelled with the five factors, is advertising to them based on that really as simple as slightly hokey-sounding appeals to love of order, or fear of the other?\n\nThat said, there’s clearly something in it. Take a look instead at a patent filed in 2012 on “determining user personality characteristics from social networking system communications”. “Stored personality characteristics may be used as targeting criteria for advertisers ... to increase the likelihood that the user … positively interacts with a selected advertisement,” the patent suggests. Its author? Facebook itself.",

    "article_text": "Former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix allegedly withdrew more than $8 million from the British data firm before its collapse last month.\n\nThe Financial Times, citing sources, reported that Nix took the cash shortly after media reports of Cambridge Analytica's involvement in the Facebook data scandal.\n\nHe is now in dispute with investors over returning the money, which was reportedly intended to help get successor data firm, Emerdata, off the ground.\n\nNix told British lawmakers on Wednesday that the allegation in the FT article was \"false.\"\n\n\n\nThe former CEO of Cambridge Analytica allegedly withdrew more than $8 million (£6 million) from the British data firm before its collapse last month.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Alexander Nix is in dispute with investors after he allegedly walked away with the cash, while Cambridge Analytica staff and investors salvaged little or nothing from the company's closure.\n\nSpecifically, the FT said, the dispute is with the investors in Emerdata, a potential successor company set up by the power players at Cambridge Analytica.\n\nEmerdata reportedly raised $19 million from international investors in January, before Cambridge Analytica's role in harvesting the data of 87 million Facebook users became public knowledge.\n\nThis money ran out quickly, however, because of outstanding bills to advertisers and suppliers, and Nix's alleged withdrawal. Bankruptcy filings in New York show that Cambridge Analytica received an $8.8 million loan from Emerdata before it entered administration, according to the FT.\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted Nix for comment. He has not commented on the allegations so far. People familiar with the matter told the FT that Nix's withdrawal came shortly after the data breach story exploded and was made in \"exchange for unbooked services.\" He intends to repay part of the money, the FT said.\n\nNix was asked about the alleged transaction on Wednesday when he appeared before British lawmakers to answer questions about the Facebook data scandal. \"What I can say is that the allegation in that article is false. The facts in that article are not correct,\" he said.\n\nIt is the second time he will give evidence to the powerful Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee after lawmakers fear he may have misled them during his first hearing.\n\nWhat is Emerdata?\n\nEmerdata was incorporated in the UK last year by several Cambridge Analytica executives before the Facebook scandal thrust their activities into the spotlight.\n\nRebekah and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of hedge fund tycoon and prominent Trump supporter Robert Mercer, joined Emerdata as directors as the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit. Another notable director was Johnson Chun Shun Ko, an executive with close links to another Trump supporter, Erik Prince.\n\nThe timing of the appointments contributed to media speculation that Emerdata could succeed Cambridge Analytica, since it involved many of the same people and backers.\n\nBut Nigel Oakes, founder of Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL, told Bloomberg in May that Emerdata had gone into administration. \"The whole lot is gone,\" he said.",

    "article_text": "When the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica announced last week it would be closing its doors and filing for bankruptcy in the wake of the Facebook Inc. data scandal, speculation mounted that it would be revived under the guise of two new companies set up in London.\n\nNot so, said Nigel Oakes, the founder of Cambridge Analytica’s British affiliate, SCL Group.\n\n\"It’s the end of the show,\" he said by phone Tuesday. \"The whole lot is gone. There’s no secret. For anything like this to recreate itself you need a team of people to work together but nobody is working together. Everybody has gone off to do their own things.\"\n\nSeveral media outlets had pointed to filings on U.K. business registry Companies House showing Cambridge Analytica executives had set up a London-based firm in August 2017 called Emerdata Ltd. Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, the daughters of conservative hedge fund tycoon and Trump supporter Robert Mercer, joined the board in March.\n\nOakes said the original idea was to acquire Cambridge Analytica and SCL and put them under one roof. Now Emerdata is also in administration, he said. Firecrest Technologies Ltd., another company created in March by former Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Officer Alexander Nix, would also be wound down, he said. Firecrest’s main shareholder was Emerdata, according to company filings. Nix declined to comment when reached by phone.\n\nBoth companies were set up before revelations from a whistle blower were released in March that Cambridge Analytica had misused data from millions of Facebook users that underpinned work on U.S. President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Oakes didn’t say what would happen to the company’s intellectual property or the voter profile data it had built.\n\n\"That’s the end of it,\" Oakes said. \"The whole group has been closed down. There’s no other organization that’s been created.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica announced last week that it was beginning bankruptcy proceedings, saying the media storm over its use of Facebook data had scared clients away. The scandal worsened with the release of an undercover video showing Nix talking about the use of bribery to trap politicians in foreign election campaigns. The company then suspended Nix while it started an independent investigation. The results of that investigation challenged some of the allegations made about how the firm acquired Facebook data, but the company concluded it still couldn’t continue.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” the company said in a statement announcing insolvency proceedings.",

Kogan maintains that he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.\n\nFacebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor – Kogan’s business partner at the time their company acquired the data, using an app called thisisyourdigitallife.\n\nCambridge Analytica – a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon – used the data to build sophisticated psychological profiles of US voters.\n\nFacebook’s deputy general counsel has described the data harvesting scheme as “a scam” and “a fraud”. He singled out Kogan, an assistant professor at Cambridge University, as having “lied to us and violated our platform policies” by passing the data on to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook’s public statements have omitted any reference to GSR, the company Kogan incorporated in May 2014 with Chancellor, who at the time was a postdoctoral research assistant.\n\nThe Guardian asked Facebook several questions about its recruitment of Chancellor and any action it had taken in light of the data harvesting scam conducted by GSR. Facebook initially promised to respond to a set of questions by Sunday, but then said it had nothing to say on the matter. Chancellor did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nThe psychologist, who is 38, is understood to have been a junior partner to Kogan, who oversaw GSR’s business dealings and then elicited the help of several of his students. One source with some knowledge of Chancellor’s role at the company described him as “just the data guy”.\n\nHowever, both Kogan and Chancellor were listed as directors of GSR when it was founded and provided a “service address” in Harley Street, London.\n\nThe property – 29 Harley Street – reportedly operates as “as a large, ornate and prestigiously located postbox and answerphone” for some 2,159 companies that are registered from the address but locate their operations elsewhere. Though potentially secretive, there is nothing unlawful about this process.\n\nIn the months that followed the creation of GSR, the company worked in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica to pay hundreds of thousands of users to take the test as part of an agreement in which they agreed for their data to be collected for academic use.\n\nHowever, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions strong. That data sold to Cambridge Analytica as part of a commercial agreement. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising.\n\nChancellor resigned his directorship of GSR in September 2015, according to company records. He joined Facebook around November 2015, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nThe following month, the Guardian published the first story detailing how Kogan and Chancellor’s company had unethically sourced data that was then passed to Cambridge Analytica, which at the time was working for the presidential campaign of Ted Cruz.\n\nFacebook appears to have taken no action against Chancellor at that stage. His role at Facebook was mentioned in a story by the Intercept 12 months ago. At that time, Facebook said in a statement: “The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook.”\n\nChancellor, who was conducting postdoctoral research at Cambridge University when GSR was set up, is understood to have been one of several students who Kogan involved in his project.\n\nData scandal is huge blow for Facebook – and efforts to study its impact on society Read more\n\nSince joining Facebook, some of Chancellor’s academic research has been published in peer-reviewed journals. However, the precise nature of his work for Facebook is unclear. The company employs many in-house social scientists to conduct research on the psychology of its users.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Facebook was revealed to have conducted a vast experiment on users, without their consent, which entailed tweaking the amount of positive and negative content appearing on their feeds to see if the tech giant could manipulate some kind of “emotional contagion”.\n\nLast year, leaked documents revealed how Facebook had told advertisers they had the capacity to monitor posts in real time and identify when teenage users were feeling “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”.\n\nThat kind of finite information is invaluable to advertisers – whether selling products or political candidates – as it helps them more effectively tailor and target their message to individual users on the platform.\n\n\n\nFacebook’s ability to create granular profiles of its users has been at the very core of its business model, transforming the social media platform into one of the most profitable companies on the planet.",

    "article_text": "The data analytics firm that worked with Donald Trump’s election team and the winning Brexit campaign harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box.\n\nA whistleblower has revealed to the Observer how Cambridge Analytica – a company owned by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, and headed at the time by Trump’s key adviser Steve Bannon – used personal information taken without authorisation in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters, in order to target them with personalised political advertisements.\n\nChristopher Wylie, who worked with a Cambridge University academic to obtain the data, told the Observer: “We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”\n\nDocuments seen by the Observer, and confirmed by a Facebook statement, show that by late 2015 the company had found out that information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale. However, at the time it failed to alert users and took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information of more than 50 million individuals.\n\nProfile Cambridge Analytica: the key players Show Hide Alexander Nix, CEO An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer. Aleksandr Kogan, data miner Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan. Steve Bannon, former board member A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.\n\nRobert Mercer, investor Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.\n\nRebekah Mercer, investor Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times is reporting that copies of the data harvested for Cambridge Analytica could still be found online; its reporting team had viewed some of the raw data.\n\nThe data was collected through an app called thisisyourdigitallife, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University. Through his company Global Science Research (GSR), in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, hundreds of thousands of users were paid to take a personality test and agreed to have their data collected for academic use.\n\nHowever, the app also collected the information of the test-takers’ Facebook friends, leading to the accumulation of a data pool tens of millions-strong. Facebook’s “platform policy” allowed only collection of friends’ data to improve user experience in the app and barred it being sold on or used for advertising. The discovery of the unprecedented data harvesting, and the use to which it was put, raises urgent new questions about Facebook’s role in targeting voters in the US presidential election. It comes only weeks after indictments of 13 Russians by the special counsel Robert Mueller which stated they had used the platform to perpetrate “information warfare” against the US.\n\nCambridge Analytica and Facebook are one focus of an inquiry into data and politics by the British Information Commissioner’s Office. Separately, the Electoral Commission is also investigating what role Cambridge Analytica played in the EU referendum.\n\n“We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used,” said the information commissioner Elizabeth Denham. “It’s part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people’s personal information to micro-target voters.”\n\nOn Friday, four days after the Observer sought comment for this story, but more than two years after the data breach was first reported, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data. Separately, Facebook’s external lawyers warned the Observer it was making “false and defamatory” allegations, and reserved Facebook’s legal position.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Key Trump adviser Steve Bannon Photograph: Alain Robert/Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nThe revelations provoked widespread outrage. The Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey announced that the state would be launching an investigation. “Residents deserve answers immediately from Facebook and Cambridge Analytica,” she said on Twitter.\n\nThe Democratic senator Mark Warner said the harvesting of data on such a vast scale for political targeting underlined the need for Congress to improve controls. He has proposed an Honest Ads Act to regulate online political advertising the same way as television, radio and print. “This story is more evidence that the online political advertising market is essentially the Wild West. Whether it’s allowing Russians to purchase political ads, or extensive micro-targeting based on ill-gotten user data, it’s clear that, left unregulated, this market will continue to be prone to deception and lacking in transparency,” he said.\n\nLast month both Facebook and the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, told a parliamentary inquiry on fake news: that the company did not have or use private Facebook data.\n\nSimon Milner, Facebook’s UK policy director, when asked if Cambridge Analytica had Facebook data, told MPs: “They may have lots of data but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”\n\nCambridge Analytica’s chief executive, Alexander Nix, told the inquiry: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”\n\nWylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica and Kogan to devise and implement the scheme, showed a dossier of evidence about the data misuse to the Observer which appears to raise questions about their testimony. He has passed it to the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit and the Information Commissioner’s Office. It includes emails, invoices, contracts and bank transfers that reveal more than 50 million profiles – mostly belonging to registered US voters – were harvested from the site in one of the largest-ever breaches of Facebook data. Facebook on Friday said that it was also suspending Wylie from accessing the platform while it carried out its investigation, despite his role as a whistleblower.\n\nAt the time of the data breach, Wylie was a Cambridge Analytica employee, but Facebook described him as working for Eunoia Technologies, a firm he set up on his own after leaving his former employer in late 2014.\n\nThe evidence Wylie supplied to UK and US authorities includes a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers sent to him in August 2016, asking him to destroy any data he held that had been collected by GSR, the company set up by Kogan to harvest the profiles.\n\nThat legal letter was sent several months after the Guardian first reported the breach and days before it was officially announced that Bannon was taking over as campaign manager for Trump and bringing Cambridge Analytica with him.\n\n“Because this data was obtained and used without permission, and because GSR was not authorised to share or sell it to you, it cannot be used legitimately in the future and must be deleted immediately,” the letter said.\n\nFacebook did not pursue a response when the letter initially went unanswered for weeks because Wylie was travelling, nor did it follow up with forensic checks on his computers or storage, he said.\n\n“That to me was the most astonishing thing. They waited two years and did absolutely nothing to check that the data was deleted. All they asked me to do was tick a box on a form and post it back.”\n\nPaul-Olivier Dehaye, a data protection specialist, who spearheaded the investigative efforts into the tech giant, said: “Facebook has denied and denied and denied this. It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law.\n\n“It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”\n\nWe exploited Facebook to harvest millions of profiles. And built models to exploit that and target their inner demons Christopher Wylie\n\nA majority of American states have laws requiring notification in some cases of data breach, including California, where Facebook is based.\n\nFacebook denies that the harvesting of tens of millions of profiles by GSR and Cambridge Analytica was a data breach. It said in a statement that Kogan “gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels” but “did not subsequently abide by our rules” because he passed the information on to third parties.\n\nFacebook said it removed the app in 2015 and required certification from everyone with copies that the data had been destroyed, although the letter to Wylie did not arrive until the second half of 2016. “We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens,” Paul Grewal, Facebook’s vice-president, said in a statement. The company is now investigating reports that not all data had been deleted.\n\nKogan, who has previously unreported links to a Russian university and took Russian grants for research, had a licence from Facebook to collect profile data, but it was for research purposes only. So when he hoovered up information for the commercial venture, he was violating the company’s terms. Kogan maintains everything he did was legal, and says he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.\n\nQuick guide How the story unfolded Show Hide In December 2016, while researching the US presidential election, Carole Cadwalladr came across data analytics company Cambridge Analytica, whose secretive manner and chequered track record belied its bland, academic-sounding name.\n\n\n\nHer initial investigations uncovered the role of US billionaire Robert Mercer in the US election campaign: his strategic “war” on mainstream media and his political campaign funding, some apparently linked to Brexit.\n\n\n\nShe found the first indications that Cambridge Analytica might have used data processing methods that breached the Data Protection Act. That article prompted Britain’s Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office to launch investigations whose remits include Cambridge Analytica’s use of data and its possible links to the EU referendum. These investigations are continuing, as is a wider ICO inquiry into the use of data in politics.\n\n\n\nWhile chasing the details and ramifications of complex manipulation of both data and funding law, Cadwalladr came under increasing attacks, both online and professionally, from key players.\n\n\n\nThe Leave.EU campaign tweeted a doctored video that showed her being violently assaulted, and the Russian embassy wrote to the Observer to complain that her reporting was a “textbook example of bad journalism”.\n\n\n\nBut the growing profile of her reports also gave whistleblowers confidence that they could trust her to not only understand their stories, but retell them clearly for a wide audience.\n\n\n\nHer network of sources and contacts grew to include not only former employees who regretted their work but academics, lawyers and others concerned about the impact on democracy of tactics employed by Cambridge Analytica and associates.\n\n\n\nCambridge Analytica is now the subject of special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probing of the company’s role in Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. Investigations in the UK remain live.\n\nThe Observer has seen a contract dated 4 June 2014, which confirms SCL, an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with GSR, entirely premised on harvesting and processing Facebook data. Cambridge Analytica spent nearly $1m on data collection, which yielded more than 50 million individual profiles that could be matched to electoral rolls. It then used the test results and Facebook data to build an algorithm that could analyse individual Facebook profiles and determine personality traits linked to voting behaviour.\n\nThe algorithm and database together made a powerful political tool. It allowed a campaign to identify possible swing voters and craft messages more likely to resonate.\n\n“The ultimate product of the training set is creating a ‘gold standard’ of understanding personality from Facebook profile information,” the contract specifies. It promises to create a database of 2 million “matched” profiles, identifiable and tied to electoral registers, across 11 states, but with room to expand much further.\n\nAt the time, more than 50 million profiles represented around a third of active North American Facebook users, and nearly a quarter of potential US voters. Yet when asked by MPs if any of his firm’s data had come from GSR, Nix said: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”\n\nCambridge Analytica said that its contract with GSR stipulated that Kogan should seek informed consent for data collection and it had no reason to believe he would not.\n\nGSR was “led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally renowned institution who made explicit contractual commitments to us regarding its legal authority to license data to SCL Elections”, a company spokesman said.\n\nSCL Elections, an affiliate, worked with Facebook over the period to ensure it was satisfied no terms had been “knowingly breached” and provided a signed statement that all data and derivatives had been deleted, he said. Cambridge Analytica also said none of the data was used in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSteve Bannon’s lawyer said he had no comment because his client “knows nothing about the claims being asserted”. He added: “The first Mr Bannon heard of these reports was from media inquiries in the past few days.” He directed inquires to Nix.",

    "article_text": "The UpGuard Cyber Team’s latest discovery of a data leak, involving the exposed IT assets of a data analytics firm based in British Columbia, Canada, presents significant questions for society about how technology can be used. In this first installment of a multipart series titled “The AIQ Files,” we begin to explain the importance of the data revealed from a publicly exposed AggregateIQ repository, and how it relates to recent US political history.\n\nComing amidst a firestorm of scrutiny about how political operations can use and harvest consumer information, including from social media networks like Facebook, the UpGuard Cyber Risk Team can now reveal that a large code repository originating from AggregateIQ, a Canadian political data firm active in the 2016 US presidential race, was left publicly downloadable online. Revealed within this repository is a set of sophisticated applications, data management programs, advertising trackers, and information databases that collectively could be used to target and influence individuals through a variety of methods, including automated phone calls, emails, political websites, volunteer canvassing, and Facebook ads. Also exposed among these tools are numerous credentials, keys, hashes, usernames, and passwords to access other AIQ assets, including databases, social media accounts, and Amazon Web Services repositories, raising the possibility of attacks by any malicious actors encountering the exposure.\n\nThis exposure reveals how applications and web assets apparently developed by AggregateIQ (AIQ), a small firm of twenty employees based in Victoria, British Columbia, were customized for the failed 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), as well as for Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott and a number of foreign political parties and figures. The Cruz connection raises obvious questions about the relationship of AggregateIQ to Cambridge Analytica (CA), a controversial London-based data analytics firm which was paid $5.8 million dollars by the Cruz campaign for services rendered in his unsuccessful bid for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nCambridge Analytica, which is now being investigated for collecting the Facebook profiles of over fifty million users without their permission, has been reported to work closely with AggregateIQ in their efforts on behalf of clients, as will be further explained. In this first installment of “The AIQ Files,” we take a closer look at the suite of political data and microtargeting tools possessed by AggregateIQ and exposed in this data repository - in turn revealing the inner workings of the kind of influencing prowess in which Cambridge Analytica claimed expertise, to the campaigns of customers like Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, and Donald Trump.\n\nThe Discovery of a Possible Misconfiguration\n\nOn the night of March 20th, 2018, UpGuard Director of Cyber Risk Research Chris Vickery discovered a large data warehouse hosted on a subdomain of AIQ and using a custom version of popular code repository Gitlab, located at the web address gitlab.aggregateiq.com. Entering the URL, Gitlab prompts the user to register to see the contents - a free process which simply requires supplying an email address. Once registered, contents of the dozens of separate code repositories operated on the AggregateIQ Gitlab subdomain are entirely downloadable. Within these repositories appear to be nothing less than mechanisms capable of organizing vast quantities of data about individuals, measuring how they are being influenced or reached by advertising, and even tracking their internet browsing behavior.\n\nSome of the projects contained in the development repository.\n\nA partial explanation of the workings of some of the tools contained in the repository.\n\nIf the potential power of the tools exposed in this incident seem extraordinary, the actual occurrence of data exposures as a result of potential misconfiguration is all too common. The simple matter of fixing a permission setting to exclude public registrants from viewing this development repository would have been the difference between whether the code was exposed or secured. As it was left publicly downloadable, many sets of internal credentials that could have been used to launch damaging attacks were left out in the open.\n\nWho is AggregateIQ?\n\nFurther installments of this series will detail the technical workings revealed in this leak, starting with a report detailing the presence of assets apparently designed for use by the presidential campaign of Senator Cruz. The presence of this kind of data raises an obvious question, however: what is the relationship between the failed presidential campaign of Ted Cruz, and a small data firm based in British Columbia? The answer appears to be a complicated one, but involves Cambridge Analytica and a number of tense political situations around the world.\n\nThere have already been a number of major journalistic revelations about the ties between Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ. But as recounted by former CA employee and current whistleblower Christopher Wylie to Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, claiming “AIQ wouldn’t exist without me,” it is reported to have started with a recruitment effort:\n\n“‘When I became research director for SCL [the parent company of Cambridge Analytica] we needed to rapidly expand our technical capacity and I reached out to a lot of people I had worked with in the past.’ That included Jeff Silvester, his former boss, who lived in Wylie’s home town…[Silvester] then set up AIQ with his business partner, Zack Massingham, to work on SCL and later Cambridge Analytica projects. ‘Essentially it was set up as a Canadian entity for people who wanted to work on SCL projects who didn’t want to move to London. That’s how AIQ got started: originally to service SCL and Cambridge Analytica projects,’ said Wylie. Last March, when the Observer started asking questions about the connection between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ, the former removed ‘SCL Canada’ and Massingham’s phone number from its website and said that AIQ was a ‘former IT contractor’.”\n\nThe additional information reported by Cadwalladr that SCL Elections, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, owns AggregateIQ’s intellectual property “in perpetuity” helps to further make clear the significance of the Gitlab subdomain’s contents. While Cambridge Analytica may operate as an independent from, distinct from AggregateIQ, the working relationship appears to be much closer - as evidenced in the tale of an app, contained in the exposed repository.\n\nRipon, Wisconsin is the site of the schoolhouse where, in 1854, the Republican Party was founded. It is for this historical footnote that, as Mother Jones reports, Cambridge Analytica named its “all-in-one tool that let a campaign manage its voter database, microtargeting efforts, door-to-door canvassing, low-dollar fundraising, and surveys,” as successfully pitched to the campaign of Senator Cruz in 2015.\n\nThe code for two projects in AggregateIQ’s Gitlab repository, under the names “Ripon_canvas” and “Ripon_dialer,” contain this same name.\n\nThe “libs” folder within “Ripon_canvas” begins to give some illustration as to how this actually was meant to function. Contained within these libraries are configuration files for using Ripon in a number of crucial primary and caucus states - Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Mexico, Nevada, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, and Wyoming. Among the most interesting is the configuration file titled “config.ia.php,” likely signifying Iowa, the crucial first caucus state Ted Cruz won in 2016 while using Cambridge Analytica’s data. This configuration file, like all the others, contains an exposed Facebook app ID and secret key, as well as credentials accessing Twilio, an SMS messaging service.\n\nA script contained within \"Ripon_canvas\" with text as such might be used by the Cruz campaign.\n\nNotes on updates within \"Ripon_dialer\" indicating phonebanking utility.\n\nThe repository titles hint that this particular application could be for canvassing voters appears borne out by the technical contents. Users of “Ripon_canvas” can be assigned to one of three classes: “administrator,” “campaign manager,” or “volunteer,” pointing to standard field operations for a political campaign.\n\nOther data reveals that any time a new configuration is created for a new state, four user accounts are automatically added as the new file is seeded with starter data. The last two of these four accounts - System, Admin, SCL, and AIQ - are the most intriguing. While AggregateIQ’s acronym is obvious, SCL likely refers to Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Elections.\n\nTaken in full, it remains unclear why what resembles a version of the app Cambridge Analytica promised would be “revolutionary” for the Cruz campaign would be found in the development repository of AggregateIQ.\n\nThe Significance, and More to Come\n\nThe story of the Ripon application, and its intersection with the presidential aspirations of Ted Cruz, Cambridge Analytica, and AggregateIQ, is but one element in a greater story. In this one data exposure, we can see how small process errors can potentially reveal vast systems of information - juggernauts, often too powerful to be managed and secured by even their gatekeepers.\n\nThe emerging societal concern for how enterprises treat our personal information - whether it is a gigantic, blue-chip tech power like Facebook, or a little-known data operation operating in small-town British Columbia - makes this an all too relevant story to recount. The revelation that one inadvertent leak can reveal implements designed to potentially influence entire electorates, and perhaps expose millions of people to the invasion of their privacy and the possibility of harm by malicious actors, tells us that the stakes are too high to get this wrong.",

    "article_text": "Our recent discovery and analysis of publicly downloadable code repositories originating from data analytics firm AggregateIQ has answered a few questions, but raised many more. In Part One of “The AggregateIQ Files,” we explained how the data exposed from within this development repository appear to corroborate existing evidence and accusations that AggregateIQ and Cambridge Analytica, an embattled and highly controversial data firm, work closely together, on projects that appear customized for Cambridge Analytica clients like Texas Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nIn Part Two of “The AggregateIQ Files,” we take a closer look at how some of the exposed repositories reveal sensitive information about a number of political organizations in the United Kingdom, with a particular focus on AggregateIQ's apparent work on behalf of British groups active in the \"Leave\" campaign for the UK's momentous \"Brexit\" referendum.\n\nIn this report, we examine more closely a particularly important category of AIQ’s data set: code from several websites, each concerning a British political organization, party, or pressure group. Some of these entities are already known to have been AggregateIQ customers, and most of them were groups active in the successful “Leave” campaign in the run-up to the UK’s 2016 “Brexit” referendum, in which the country voted to exit the European Union. We shall describe this technical data, as well as highlight the more interesting bits each repository contains.\n\nAll of the following analyses describe data contained in AggregateIQ’s formerly publicly accessible code repositories. We have redacted specific references to the locations and hostnames of data stores, as well as credentials, keys, portions of email addresses, personal identities, and more at our discretion and where appropriate. UpGuard Inc. presents these findings as a good-faith analysis and technical contribution to the ongoing conversation around these matters, which concern matters of public interest - in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European Union.\n\nIt should be noted that, beyond their inherent relevance to current events in the United Kingdom, a primary reason these findings are notable is the fact that typically source files are not accessible by regular visitors to various websites. Simply put, someone with administrative access to the web servers in question either uploaded these files to the AIQ GitLab instance themselves, or provided the files to someone at AIQ who then put them in these code repositories on their behalf - establishing some important links in the process.\n\nThe Exposure\n\nAmong the AggregateIQ repositories exposed in this breach are seven that concern British political organizations. Below are screen captures of some of them, within the greater AIQ development repository.\n\nLet us now turn to the contents of each of these repositories.\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP)\n\nThe Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland, supported overwhelmingly by Northern Irish Protestants who favor continued union between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. The DUP represents Northern Irish constituents in both the Northern Ireland Assembly, a devolved legislature in Belfast administering much of the region’s affairs, and in the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster, where the party currently serves in a coalition government with Prime Minister Theresa May’s ruling Conservative Party.\n\nIn the 2016 run-up to the Brexit referendum, the DUP campaigned in favor of the “Leave” movement, spending a large amount on the effort - including over thirty-three thousand pounds spent patronizing AggregateIQ’s services. The DUP repository exposed in the custom AIQ Gitlab, titled “Client-DUP-ActionSite,” once again contains HTML source code, this time for a segment of the DUP’s home webpage at www.mydup.com.\n\nThis source code is for a number of apparent “action sites” - landing pages built around a specific issue or candidate, each soliciting the web user’s name and email address to receive further updates. The code below, for a landing page featuring DUP politician Christopher Stalford, gives some idea of the appearance.\n\nAlso revealed in this repository is code for a similar landing page whose call to action is to “support the DUP’s pledge to deliver the best possible Brexit for Northern Ireland as part of a clean exit for the United Kingdom.”\n\nThis exposure of assets designed for the DUP’s website in the development repository of AggregateIQ comes at a time of public scrutiny about how the party came to hire AIQ, as well as about the party’s spending on AIQ’s services and whether it may have been coordinated with some of the other organizations mentioned in these repositories.\n\nVeterans for Britain\n\nDescribing itself as “formed in March 2016 in order to put forward the Defence and Security arguments for the UK to leave the European Union in the 2016 Referendum,” Veterans for Britain is a pressure group consisting largely of UK military members and veterans which, besides campaigning for the successful “Leave” initiative, now operates to help influence the terms of Brexit’s defense provisions. Like the DUP, Veterans for Britain is already known to have been a customer of AggregateIQ, spending £100,000 with the data firm.\n\nExposed within the repository, which is titled Client-VeteransForBritain-Site, is a database dump and WordPress backup for the organization’s official webpage, located at the address veteransforbritain.uk. The administrator email for this website belongs to an AIQ employee found in many of the AIQ repositories, as seen below; his name has been redacted from his email address, but its origin from the AggregateIQ.com domain is still visible.\n\nIn the table listing those Wordpress users with administrative access to the site - granting them the ability to edit or post content on VeteransForBritain.uk - are three individuals. As seen below, the first user, whose name has been redacted, is the same aforementioned AggregateIQ employee who is the site administrator. The second user also has an AggregateIQ email address, and appears in other repositories. The third, however, has a non-AIQ email address, and is listed as being named “Will Carver.”\n\nMedia reports reveal that Captain William Carver, a veteran officer of the British Army, served as a spokesman for Veterans for the Britain in the runup to the 2016 referendum; a LinkedIn page under the name William Carver lists both the same military service and work with Veterans for Britain.\n\nOne function of the website code contained in this a donation mechanism for use by visitors to VeteransForBritain.uk, powered by the commonly used provider Stripe. A Stripe secret key is present along with the code used on the site to process payments, opening the possibility of a breach had a malicious actor encountered the credentials.\n\nThe site’s content which had been visible to users contained multiple pieces of collateral in the form of .PDF files, in the form of political flyers and other printed materials. Finally, also of note in the above image is the website’s timezone: “America/Vancouver,” the same timezone used by British Columbia-based AggregateIQ.\n\nVote Leave\n\nPerhaps the most important of the pro-Brexit organizations exposed in this breach, the UK Electoral Commission designated Vote Leave as the official organization for those campaigning in favor of Brexit in the lead-up to the 2016 referendum. As such, Vote Leave attracted some of the most notable pro-Brexit figures in British politics, including former Mayor of London and current Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, as well as his current peer in the Prime Minister’s Cabinet, Secretary of State for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs Michael Gove.\n\nTheir AIQ repository, titled “Brexit-sync-master,” contains a number of scripts for processing data apparently customized for VoteLeave.uk. The scripts include tools for buildings lists of people whose information has been gathered online and for contacting them, with exposed fields including voter email addresses, home addresses, and phone numbers. While no actual voter data is included in this repository, these scripts would need to be loaded with such information in order to be operated.\n\nAs seen in the image below, the scripts are capable of pulling from a file titled “nbuild_voteleave.signups” to analyze “contactable supporters” across a variety of factors, including which email Vote Leave already possesses about them. Of particular note is a script titled “Contactables labeled AIQ,” a clear reference to AggregateIQ but one of which the significance or meaning remains unclear.\n\nAlso contained are operations on what are called “contactables” - likely referring to individuals who have not specifically opted out. Some areas have references that suggest analytical heft, such as one for updating a store of “voter intentions.” A number of credentials to other linked web assets are also exposed in the repository, as is an email used by one of the aforementioned AIQ employees commonly found to have done work on the repositories.\n\nIn one area, a script exists to identify areas of Britain with hospital closures, tying these regions to specific postcodes.\n\nVote Leave’s campaigning efforts often employed National Health Service funding issues as a common talking point in favor of their pro-Brexit efforts, as embodied in the memorable slogan “Give our NHS the £350 million the EU takes every week.”\n\nVote Leave is known to have employed AggregateIQ in their efforts ahead of the 2016 referendum.\n\nChange Britain\n\nChange Britain is a successor organization to Vote Leave, established by the same principal leaders with the goal of influencing the terms of a Brexit agreement, now being negotiated between the European Union and Prime Minister May’s Cabinet. AIQ’s repository contains a WordPress backup of their official website, changebritain.org. From this backup we are able to see information regarding who created the site and when.\n\nIn the wp_users table, a significant user list exists. Redacted towards the top are the names and email addresses of a web developer and web designer, both based in AggregateIQ’s home province of British Columbia. Also listed are two aforementioned AggregateIQ employees frequently found in the repositories, logged with AIQ email addresses. Of greater significance is the presence of AggregateIQ co-founder Jeff Silvester as a user for this website, along with a number of UK figures significant to the pro-Brexit movement.\n\nChloe Westley, another one of the users listed here, is also the name of a prominent activist and Vote Leave campaign worker. Westley’s Twitter biography describes her as a “Former @Vote_Leave staffer,” while her LinkedIn lists her final role with the group as its “Head of Campaigns.” Two other figures are listed as users, both with email addresses registered at the ChangeBritain.org domain. The first, Edward Oldfield, matches the name of a LinkedIn user who lists stints as a Researcher and Campaign Coordinator with Change Britain. The second, Caroline Badley, matches the name of a former Labour Party councilor in Birmingham, England, who multiple media reports indicate served as campaign manager for former Labour Member of Parliament Gisela Stuart. Stuart served as the co-chair of the Vote Leave organization, alongside Michael Gove.\n\nTaken together, the users table indicates administrative access to the Change Britain website was shared by a co-founder of AggregateIQ, two AIQ employees, two nearby web contractors, two Change Britain associates, and, most likely, a former Vote Leave staffer. Each of these user accounts, besides being listed alongside their email addresses, are also listed next to the account’s hashed password - which, if decrypted, could be used to access the user accounts. These passwords have been redacted in the image.\n\nThis repository is large, containing a larger amount of data - mostly data relating to content posts. The use of an application called PHP Mailer, however, and its administration by AIQ employee emails, points to another site function.\n\nOne functionality the site code offers is the ability for visitors to send a form email to their Member of Parliament, using suggested language supplied by Change Britain to urge MPs to “commit to voting unconditionally for Article 50” - the provision enabling member states to exit the European Union.\n\nBesides such information, however, are sensitive credentials left exposed to anyone accessing the publicly downloadable repo. The API ID, secret key, token, and password for Change Britain’s account on NationBuilder, a voter data platform known to have been used by pro-Brexit groups, was left exposed in the code.\n\nGove 2016\n\nThis is another WordPress website and database backup, for a website that emerged very shortly after the Brexit referendum was held and then-Prime Minister David Cameron announced his plans to resign. The website, Gove2016.com, was registered with an email username known to have been used elsewhere by an aforementioned AIQ employee found throughout the repositories.\n\nSimply put, the website was designed to advance the candidacy of Michael Gove, the Vote Leave co-chair, for leadership of the Conservative Party. User data below indicates the AIQ user gained administrative access on June 30th, 2016, the same day Gove announced his candidacy.\n\nIn addition, a second user was added on July 2nd, 2016, under the name “Sam Frost” - a name also listed in Vote Leave’s official document listing its headquarters staff, as a former United Kingdom Independence Party staffer working for the campaign as a “digital officer.”\n\nThis second user account then began posting content to the webpage, revolving around Michael Gove and his case for becoming the next Tory leader.\n\nThe updates would continue until Theresa May prevailed over Gove in the leadership race on July 8th.\n\nCountryside Alliance\n\nBilling itself as “promot[ing] and protect[ing] rural life at Parliament, in the media and on the ground,” the Countryside Alliance is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization devoted to advancing causes and issues of particular importance to rural Britain. The repository named for Countryside Alliance within the AggregateIQ custom Gitlab contains HTML source code for a website at “action.countryside-alliance.org” which would have prompted visitors to supply their email address to receive further updates from info@countryside-alliance.org. The web address “www.countryside-alliance.org” is the authentic homepage for the organization.\n\nAlso exposed within the source code are apparent credentials for administering the email mechanism, as shown in redacted form below.\n\nThe repository also contains an email template for messages from Tim Bonner, the group’s leader.\n\nThe Countryside Alliance did not campaign on either side of the Brexit campaign, unlike the other UK organizations whose web assets appear exposed in this repository, and, as far as our research has shown, does not thus far appear to be publicly known as an AggregateIQ customer.\n\nBrexit My Polling Station\n\nA standalone site, or perhaps a subdomain of a VoteLeave website, designed to point voters toward their closest polling place. The code for this site uses aboutmyvote.co.uk’s government-provided data to display the querying visitor’s closest polling place, and is rather simple in design.\n\nThe Significance\n\nTaken in full, the repositories named for Vote Leave, the DUP, Gove 2016, Change Britain, and Veterans for Britain provide a detailed look into web assets produced by AggregateIQ on behalf of a wide array of pro-Brexit groups and figures (Update 4/2/2018: Per a request from its Chief Executive, the Cyber Risk Team would like to reiterate that unique among the other organizations, the nonpartisan Countryside Alliance did not take an official stance or publicly campaign on behalf of Brexit, as already mentioned in the section above. Chief Executive Tim Bonner states their work with AggregateIQ was brief and occurred a year after the Brexit referendum. Metadata of the files contained in the repository titled for Countryside Alliance provide a \"last modified date\" of July 6, 2017 at 3:23 pm, likely reflecting when they were backed up to AggregateIQ's data repository). These repositories are rife with exposed credentials, tokens, and passwords which, in the hands of a malicious actor encountering these entirely publicly accessible sites, could have exploited them to criminal effect, perhaps exposing any collected data stored in any active databases to misuse. If any of these organizations were storing data about voters who consented to receive updates in such a database whose credentials were exposed, it could have opened the potential for an even graver data breach.\n\nOne regime of European Union laws that all non-member states will still be subject to will be the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation, which will come into effect in late May. The GDPR creates stiff penalties for any exposure of personally identifiable information about a citizen of the EU, mandating rapid reporting of any breach by the affected entity and enabling massive fines in the event of an exposure. Even should the UK leave the EU, GDPR will still govern the personal information of any such citizens whose information passes through the systems of British enterprises.\n\nIt remains to be seen how these revelations of AggregateIQ’s work with this network of organizations will be met in Great Britain, but taken together, the “Brexit files” within the AIQ development repository are a stark reminder that even the most technologically advanced kinds of data are not immune from insecurity or human error.",

    "article_text": "In Part One of this series, “The AggregateIQ Files,” we explained how the UpGuard Cyber Risk Team’s discovery of a publicly downloadable data repository operated by British Columbia-based data firm AggregateIQ (AIQ) exposed technical tools used for political operations around the world, including the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX). In Part Two, we explored how the exposed repository shed light on AIQ’s work in the United Kingdom involving a number of organizations, including a Northern Irish political party crucial to Prime Minister Theresa May’s government and the official campaign in favor of the UK’s exit from the European Union.\n\nIn this, the third installment of “The AggregateIQ Files,” we travel back to the United States to take a closer look at some of the highly sophisticated technical tools revealed in this data exposure. Previously undisclosed, these tools raise concerns about data privacy today.\n\nCambridge Analytica (CA), the London-based “psychographic profiling” firm employed by such political heavyweights as President Donald Trump and National Security Advisor-designate John Bolton in the 2016 US electoral cycle, continues to dominate the news with fresh revelations about its questionable behavior. With social media giant Facebook now admitting that as many as 87 million user accounts may have been scraped by CA for use as psychographic data in the 2016 election, questions about how individuals are tracked and targeted by private enterprises in possession of specific personal data are more relevant than ever.\n\nThis report examines, for the first time ever, some of the tools possessed by a firm associated with Cambridge Analytica that were left exposed online - revealing an array of instruments for further targeting of individuals on behalf of political campaigns.\n\nThe contents of once-obscure Canadian firm AggregateIQ’s leaked data repository, discovered by the UpGuard Cyber Risk Team and first disclosed last week, only raise more questions on this front. In Part One of “The AggregateIQ Files,” we described exposed code for a campaign app named Ripon, containing customized settings for the 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz. Beyond raising more questions about AIQ’s relationship to Cambridge Analytica - which in 2015 sold Ripon to Team Cruz - the presence of such an application in the repository is but one tool in a larger toolkit.\n\nIn this report, we look more closely at these other tools in the AIQ repository. The best way to understand this suite of tools, and how they are built to function, is to think of a cluster of roots. Just as the many roots of a tree seek out water, growing in any necessary direction to suck up nutrients and funnel it up to the rest of the plant, these tools are designed to gather and use data across a number of platforms through a variety of means. The question of whether these tools were all actively deployed is an open one. What is clear is the utility of these mechanisms for use by AIQ on behalf of the kind of political actors mentioned as clients throughout the repository - clients for whom rich, detail-laden data about individual voters would be a valuable asset.\n\nBeyond these are a number of tools which constitute enormously powerful mechanisms with indications of being production-ready. Two AIQ project families in particular, titled “Monarch,” “Saga,” and “Duke,” appear to have the capability to track individuals preferences and habits on Facebook and other websites, combining those data points. Once compiled in this manner by Monarch and Saga, this information could be combined with other datasets to maximize the accuracy of outreach campaigns - whether via canvassing, direct mail, or simply through strengthened online ad targeting.\n\nDeveloping capabilities for improving ad performance is not unique to Aggregate IQ. Rather, the significance of Monarch and Saga and other tools present lie in their being part of the larger toolkit of Aggregate IQ and perhaps at one step removed, Cambridge Analytica. The data available to Aggregate IQ includes their \"Database of Truth,\" for which the RNC's voter database provides one significant input.\n\nThe extent to which AIQ and its associated entities engaged in these practices has not been determined, as the working data generated by these applications were not present in the code repositories - although keys, passwords and other credentials were present for multiple servers and Amazon Web Services S3 storage buckets used by AIQ. The ultimate endpoint to which all of this captured data might have arrived is also unclear, and could be changed arbitrarily, but the use of matching tools to collate data suggests a grander project.\n\nNevertheless, by examining the scripts and applications being built, the functions and purposes of Monarch and Saga are clear. The exposure of these influencing tools on the public internet, downloadable for anyone who encountered them, is deeply troubling. At a time of grave public concern about how personal data is used, particularly from sites like Facebook, exposed assets with names like “TargetingFriendsOfConnectionsList--” should invite scrutiny. Let us now turn to examine some of these tools, with a particular emphasis on those previously unknown and potent mechanisms capable of advanced tracking of individuals across the internet and collating their behavior within larger trends.\n\nSaga\n\nFrom what we have seen, it would appear that the capabilities of the scripts in Saga would automate enough advertisement creation, analysis and targeting tasks to allow a large number of Facebook Ad accounts - each with its own content, goals and targets - to be operated by a small number of people.\n\nBased in part on the open source Facebook Ads SDK provided by the company on GitHub, Saga contains many scripts which have been built (or rebuilt) to suit the needs of AggregateIQ and its associates. Many of the files presented in this list are either basic data housekeeping or otherwise not notable, but a few files in particular give insight into the workings of AIQ’s tracking and targeting capabilities:\n\nServer_run.py: This script clearly shows functionality to gather statistics from multiple Facebook Ads accounts. In particular, advertisement performance, money spent, and creatives are gathered and stored in a database.\n\nServer_run.py\n\nMonitoring.py: A periodic script which checks how long it’s been since each ad account was “scraped” for data. If any ad accounts had not been scraped in over 24 hours, an email would be sent to three individuals at AIQ, including its president, Zack Massingham.\n\nMonitoring.py\n\nAssets_backup_to_s3.py: A rather simple script to upload Facebook ad assets to a storage bucket on Amazon S3 and delete them from the local machine.\n\nAssets_backup_to_s3.py\n\nBottle-server.py: Bottle is a simple web framework for Python in wide use, and here it provides a basic browser-based interface for administrators of AIQ’s Facebook ad accounts. The root url (‘/’) when accessed would contain only two options-- “Start Scrape Run” which would kick off the aforementioned server_run.py script, and “Check Last Scrape Run” which seems to return the time the last scrape would have completed. This is probably only slightly more convenient than running the script on the command line.\n\nBottle-server.py\n\nConversions_experiment.py: Retrieves Facebook page performance data for pages.\n\nConversions_experiment.py\n\n>Amount_spent_wtf.py: This script uses repurposed code from other scripts to collect spend amounts for AIQ-operated ad accounts. A comment at the top of the script explains its purpose-- “## WTF - we have a different number in ad_accounts.amount_spent than the calculated number from ad_sinsights!!?!”\n\nAmount_spent_wtf.py\n\nThe subfolder ‘aatrax’ contains configuration files used by many of the aforementioned scripts:\n\nModels.py: Describes many of the fields being tracked and utilized by AIQ. Of particular note are the geotargeting functions that allow ad administrators to target ads down to the city level-- or potentially even more precisely by defining custom locations. Another interesting bit is TargetingFriendsOfConnectionsList-- suggesting that AIQ and its clients could have used that capability to target specific users with political ads based on who their friends are.\n\nModels.py\n\nHelpers.py is a script containing often-reused functions to gather ad spend data and engagement results for ad campaigns including user comments, reactions and shares.\n\nHelpers.py\n\nWithin the ‘meta’ subfolder, a SQL schema file called saga-fb-schema.sql describes the layout of the database used by these scripts. The table “targeting_custom_locations” supports the idea that extremely specific geotargeting is doable with this software. By properly utilizing fields like address_string, radius, latitude and longitude, the possibility arises to target ads down to specific neighborhoods, or potentially even the individual household.\n\nMonarch\n\nIf Saga is a tool capable of tracking what happens when someone clicks a Facebook ad, Monarch seems designed to track what happens afterward, giving the controlling entity a more complete picture of their targets’ behavior. The Monarch project family consists of several sub-projects, the most interesting being “Jewel,” “Peon,” and “Peasant.”\n\nJewel\n\nJewel\n\nJewel is a somewhat uncomplicated pixel tracking application. It consists of a simple web server that serves a 1x1 pixel .PNG file. When embedded in a web page and loaded by a visitor’s browser, the server behind this practically invisible image would send a request to Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) with a small data payload indicating the event. Those events are then ingested by Peon.\n\nPeasant\n\nPeasant\n\nPeasant appears to be a distinct implementation of Jewel which allows for more specific tracking of behaviors and events on participating websites. Actions such as form submissions, watching video content, hitting the bottom of a page (indicating the viewer has read it) and donation confirmations are all test cases within this repository.\n\nPeon\n\nConsisting of several smaller parts, Peon is a small collection of tools made to ingest and utilize data being gathered.\n\nPeon\n\nThe readme file explains the project’s functions:\n\n# Monarch - PEON\n\nThe Monarch Peon Service. At one point this functionality was built into Jewel (pixel serving). It has been split out so the functionality can be extended for the following purposes:\n\n## 0. Index\n\n* 1. Features & Purpose\n\n* 2. Guide to building peon services\n\n* 3. Set-up / Run Peon\n\n* 4. Pushing / Pulling new version\n\n* 5. General tips & Tricks\n\n* 6. Using Internal Peon Caching\n\n* 7. Relevant Monarch info\n\n* 8. To-do\n\n## 1. Features & Purpose\n\n* Dockerized Swarms of processing servers.\n\n* All services use a shared code-base. Each one simply runs a different command at launch (defined in docker-compose.yml)\n\n* Each docker image will have a specific purpose. These are defined below in the following format: `Code Name` (Swarm count?): Description.\n\n- [x] `muncher` (3-5): Queue Processor. This is a service that grabs items from AWS SQS and processes them into the MongoDB.\n\n- [x] `domino` (1): Person Finder. This will process MongoDB raw request form submits to find people.\n\n- [x] `mailbox` (1): Email Finder. This will process MongoDB raw request form submits to find emails\n\n- [x] `origins` (1): Source Url Extraction. This will process raw requests to find and tag appropriate source urls (where px was fired).\n\n- [x] `columbus` (1): Location Discovery. This will process IP & Postal codes to find Location information on people / sessions.\n\n- [x] `synergy` (1): Saga Sync Service. Will grab relevant information from Saga and drop it into MongoDB.\n\n- [x] `crayon` (1-3): Report & Stat Generation. Global report manager.\n\n- [ ] `funnel` (1-2): Import / Export Manager. This service will generate exports, and (DISABLE) process imports.\n\n- [x] `kindergarten` (1-2): Interaction Scoring. This service processes raw requests to assign engagement levels to people, sessions, urls, etc.\n\n- [ ] `saga` (1): Facebook Ad Collection and Storage. This service will replace saga as a 3rd party scraping service.\n\nThe functions of the accompanying code appear to be built as described. Kindergarten is on the receiving end of Jewel’s SQS requests. The others seem designed for tasks such as locating and joining known people to their tracking events. Synergy is designed to sync this tracking data with the Saga ad tracking platform, to “close the loop” and potentially refine Facebook ad targeting with knowledge about specific users’ behavior on Jewel-equipped websites.\n\nDid a voter read just one page and leave? Did they view several pages? Did they donate to a candidate? Given the ability Saga grants to target individuals and specific locations with ads, it is not out of the question for ad campaign administrators to use this technology to attempt to sway views on issues or to push susceptible voters deeper toward a given ideology based on their behaviors online and, perhaps, in the real world.\n\nThus far, it is certain that the software in these projects represents a sophisticated effort to run highly targeted political ad campaigns addressed toward very specific groups of users and even individuals.\n\nThe Significance\n\nWhile stories reported by outlets like the New York Times have covered what data Facebook collects on users, Monarch and Saga do not contain such user data. Rather, both Monarch and Saga function like something akin to homing missiles: they need input in order to work. In this repository, we have the tools exposed, but without the knowledge of what targets they may have been deployed against, and what they might have found. What is clear is that these tools can use data to target ads, collecting information on the user engagement with those ads to further refine ad targeting and improve performance.",

    "article_text": "The UpGuard Cyber Risk Team’s discovery and analysis of an exposed data repository belonging to AggregateIQ (AIQ), a British Columbia-based data firm, has taken readers around the globe, implicating a number of high-profile political customers in a number of countries. Part One of “The AggregateIQ Files” offered an exclusive look at how exposed technical tools designed for the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) shed light on AIQ’s relationship with Cambridge Analytica - an embattled analytics shop recently revealed to have misused data from 87 million Facebook user accounts. In Part Two, we examined how the repository’s contents revealed AIQ’s work on behalf of a variety of political pressure groups in the United Kingdom - most of them heavily involved in the successful 2016 effort to vote to leave the European Union. In Part Three, we took a closer look at the tools revealed to have been built and stored in the unsecured repository - technical mechanisms capable of highly sophisticated tracking and microtargeting of individuals across the internet.\n\nIn this installment, Part Four of “The AggregateIQ Files,” we return to examine data revealed in the exposure showing AIQ’s involvement in political efforts closer to its home base of Victoria, British Columbia. While AggregateIQ’s work on behalf of a number of Canadian politicians is already known, this data provides clear insight into what specific assets were built and possessed by AIQ for their clients, along with previously unreported information - including about exposed credentials and passwords.\n\nIt has been with some astonishment to the residents of picturesque Victoria, British Columbia, that AggregateIQ - a small data firm of “about half a dozen employees,” headquartered on the city’s Market Square - has emerged as a central player in an international news story stretching from London to Silicon Valley. With more evidence emerging of its close ties to Cambridge Analytica, the political analytics company currently under investigation for its harvesting of data from over 87 million Facebook user accounts, AggregateIQ is being scrutinized by organizations around the world. While the UK’s Parliament and Information Commissioner’s Office have already been scrutinizing AIQ over its work in the pro-Brexit movement, Facebook, under congressional fire, suspended the company from its platform, citing AIQ’s documented ties to Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL).\n\nCloser to home, both AggregateIQ and Facebook are now being investigated by provincial and federal regulators in Canada, which are broadening their inquiries into whether either company breached privacy laws. With this rising level of attention, Canadian politicians who patronized AggregateIQ have increasingly come forward, disclosing and detailing their relationships with the embattled company. This is a trend to be lauded. As regulators and elected officials investigate AggregateIQ’s work, the company’s connections to Cambridge Analytica and SCL, and whether there is any connection to broader misuse of personal data around the world, there is clearly a public interest for Canadians to learn more about the services AggregateIQ provided within Canada. Indeed, doing so is also in the best interest of any Canadian politicians who employed AIQ for entirely legitimate and mundane political services, and who now face reputational damage through no fault of their own for AIQ’s other activities.\n\nThe exposure of a code repository maintained by AggregateIQ, which was discovered by the UpGuard Cyber Risk Team and then secured, may shed some light on these issues, and perhaps help to protect both the Canadian electorate and politicians who hired AIQ for data services. Within this code warehouse are a number of repositories named for specific politicians and parties, with each listed as a client. These repositories largely contain code base for the construction of websites by AIQ employees, in a structure very similar to those repositories maintained for a number of UK political organizations elsewhere in the larger warehouse. Exposed among this data are credentials, tokens, and passwords that could potentially have been used for the unauthorized access of more information.\n\nLet us now turn to each repository concerning a Canadian political figure or party.\n\nTodd Stone, Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia\n\nTodd Stone is a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, a provincial-level legislature, and member of the British Columbia Liberal Party, a centre-right political group in the province. While Stone currently serves as his party’s Official Opposition Critic for Municipal Affairs in the Assembly, in February 2018 he ran for the position of leader of the BC Liberals, and was eliminated on the third ballot.\n\nIn January 2018, it was revealed the Stone campaign had retained the services of AggregateIQ in advance of this leadership bid, drawing some scrutiny due to the firm’s advertised work on the Brexit campaign and subsequent investigation by British regulators. Stone campaign spokesman Stephen Smart described AIQ’s work as “maintaining and marketing ‘digital campaign assets’ for Mr. Stone in the leadership race, adding: ‘Our campaign maintains complete control of all voter and supporter information that is gathered through the use of these digital tools.’”\n\nAggregateIQ’s work on behalf of Stone would, however, draw controversy in the run-up to the leadership election, as over 1,300 new party members signed up by the Stone campaign were eliminated by auditors. As explained by a Stone spokesman, “AggregateIQ...created domain names and email portals to attach email addresses to new members, who were mainly Chinese Canadians in Richmond and Indo-Canadian residents in Surrey.” By creating these emails en masse for new members lacking such accounts, AIQ’s work “could have theoretically allowed the Stone campaign to control registration on behalf of those members,” a rules violation that resulted in their elimination by BC Liberal officials.\n\nRevealed in the AIQ repository are what appears to be some of those digital tools, stored across four repositories bearing Stone’s name. “Client-Todd Stone-Site” contains two folders, “donate.toddstone.ca” and “toddstone.ca,” both of which reference an official campaign website that is still active. Contained within these folders are web assets that appear to be identical to those used on the website.\n\nWith the donation subdomain on the site is still live, the folder “donate.toddstone.ca” contains assets that appear to match those used on the site, including an html header for “toddstone.ca/donate,” scripts for the donation tool used on the site, and code for confirmation screens displayed after a successful donation. Of greatest interest, however, is code containing an exposed secret key for a Stripe payment processing account used to receive donations to the Stone campaign, raising the possibility that anyone viewing this publicly accessible data repository could have gained unauthorized access to this account.\n\nExposed Stripe credentials within the Stone repository.\n\nThe other main folder in the repo, “Toddstone.ca,” contains more code for donations on the site, including a vision of what a successful donor would see by way of confirmation.\n\nThe confirmation message that would be seen by Stone donors.\n\nA folder titled “Assets” contains photos of Todd Stone, including the header image used atop the “toddstone.ca” webpage (shown below), as well as images for use in social sharing of the site.\n\nAn image of Stone contained in the repository and used on his website.\n\nThe second relevant repository, “Client-ToddStone-Assets,” is a small one containing more scripts and images of this type, such as the logo used on the website (shown below).\n\nAn image in the repository.\n\nAnother repository, titled “Client-ToddStone-Events,” contains what appears to be code for event management software, and includes an input for emailing addresses. Code in the file app.class.php also reveals that this information is posted back to an account on NationBuilder, a website offering users grassroots political campaigning technology.\n\nThe code for managing events.\n\nThe final relevant repository, “Client-ToddStone-Reports,” contains a number of internal assets and scripts with utility for reporting purposes. The file “voters.sql” provides the schema for managing a voter database; while no actual voter data is stored within, you can see how such information would be organized, collecting voter names addresses, phone numbers, and information such as whether they are campaign volunteers or have opted to not receive phone calls.\n\nSome of the code, including for data fields, within \"voters.sql.\"\n\nElsewhere, in a folder titled “Webroot,” are a number of other interesting assets, some connecting to external services and other known AIQ projects. While the scripts stored in a sub-folder titled “Monarch” appear to be relatively benign - apart from an exposed database password - and are designed to analyze the number of supporters registered and voting by riding, the cache’s name bears some significance. “Monarch” is also the name of the suite of AIQ tools used to track individual behavior online; its exact relationship to this code, if any, is unclear. A filetitled “constituency-stats.json” provides further computing power for tabulating supporters across British Columbia constituencies.\n\nA subfolder titled “Nationbuilder” contains scripts bearing exposed tokens, with its name indicating its possible utility in accessing an external account on Nationbuilder, the aforementioned voter data platform previously found in other AIQ repositories. The code contained in the “Nationbuilder” subfolder appears to provide more ways of analyzing voter data, noting the personal details and behavior of individual voters, such as whether they are a supporter and to what degree.\n\nSome of the \"nationbuilder\" code.\n\nFinally, a subfolder titled “Zack” contains clear references to Zack Massingham, co-founder of AggregateIQ.\n\nCode for a report within the subfolder \"Zack.\"\n\nThe code appears designed to transmit a report summarizing the totals on “members” and “supporters” collected elsewhere.\n\nMike de Jong, Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia\n\nLike Todd Stone, Mike de Jong is a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia who, in 2018, entered the race to succeed Christy Clark as leader of the BC Liberal Party and ultimately lost to fellow MLA Andrew Wilkinson. Unlike Todd Stone, however, de Jong did not hire AggregateIQ for that leadership race, after using the firm for his successful 2017 reelection campaign to the Legislative Assembly.\n\nContained within the two repositories titled with de Jong’s name are a number of assets that appear related to his campaign website for the 2017 reelection campaign, located at mikedejong.com (now offline). The repository “Client-MikeDeJong-Site-Master” contains a backup of this WordPress website, as well as a number of sensitive certificates exposed in the files.\n\nThe folder “Keys” contains these aforementioned certificates, perhaps for use with the website. The file “Mikedejong.com.pem” is a certificate encoded in the Privacy-enhanced Electronic Mail (PEM) format. An encoded key titled “Mikedejong.com.csr” appears to be that of a certificate signing request, used to create an SSL certificate for a website. Of perhaps gravest importance is “Mikedejong.com.key,” the private key used with a csr file to request a certificate. The exposure of such a private key is a serious security breach, potentially compromising any relevant encryption.\n\nThe redacted private key titled \"mikedejong.com.key.\"\n\nWordPress backup files are also exposed in the folder “Webroot,” along with database access credentials left exposed in the wp-config.php code, seen below.\n\nThe exposed database access credentials within \"wp-config.php.\"\n\nAn SQL backup, titled “mdj_wordpress.sql,” provides further insight into the content that appeared on www.mikedejong.com when it was live. As can be seen below, the content included familiar political language about de Jong’s work with constituents, as well as his personal biography.\n\nSome of the website content revealed within \"mdj_wordpress.sql.\"\n\nFinally, as has been true of every WordPress backup found throughout the AIQ repositories, the users table shows AggregateIQ employees listed as the administrators - in this case, three of them, whose names repeat throughout many of the website backups. They are redacted below.\n\nThe WordPress users table. Note the AggregateIQ email addresses.\n\nFinally, a second repository, titled “Client-MikeDeJong-survey-master,” is also present in the data leak, revealing code for surveying individuals, with apparent capabilities for plugging in questions and answers.\n\nSome of the code within \"Survey_finished.html.\"\n\nCode in “Survey_finished.html” includes apparent confirmation message of survey as finished, with permission for Mike De Jong to contact user later on appropriate questions, as well as providing the user with the ability to share the survey on social media.\n\nDoug Clovechok, Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia\n\nIn May 2017, BC Liberal candidate Doug Clovechok won a seat in May 2017 to the province’s Legislative Assembly, defeating an incumbent from the New Democratic Party (NDP). AggregateIQ assisted Clovechok in this campaign.\n\nThe repository “clovechok-site-master” contains what appears to be a WordPress backup for his website, http://dougclovechok.ca, a URL which now redirects to http://dougclovechokmla.ca/. As with other Wordpress backups for Canadian politicians, these folders show that two Aggregate IQ employees were site administrators, as seen below in an image taken from database_dump.sql.\n\nThe WordPress users table.\n\nThe Wordpress “uploads/2017” folder has subfolders named 03, 04, 05, 06, suggesting that assets were added between March and June of 2017. Most of the assets in these folders are pictures of Clovechok as a candidate, but one exception is “Trump-softwood.jpg,” used on the page http://dougclovechok.ca/landing_pages/dont-let-trump-bully-us-on-softwood-lumber, presumably in reference to Donald Trump’s tariff on Canadian softwood.\n\nThe Trump image contained in the repository.\n\nElsewhere in the website backup, readers can see where this image was used - on a webpage criticizing the tariff and vowing the BC Liberal Party wouldn’t “let Trump bully us on softwood lumber!”\n\nThe code containing the Trump image, along with the content on behalf of the BC Liberals.\n\nFinally, code in “tpl_jobs.html” shows the contents of an email message to be sent to voters.\n\nThe \"tpl_jobs.html\" message.\n\nOther assets in the repository show PHP Mailer functionality for sending such messages.\n\nDavid Calder, 2017 Candidate for the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia\n\nThough David Calder was unsuccessful in his 2017 bid to represent the Saanich South riding for the BC Liberals in the Legislative Assembly, his past as an Olympic medalist in rowing marks him as a distinguished local citizen who may someday be elected to office. Along with de Jong and Clovechok, Calder is the third Legislative Assembly candidate for the BC Liberals who used the services of AggregateIQ in the provincial elections that year.\n\nAs with the other candidates, the repository “calder-site-master” contains a WordPress backup for a past iteration of his website, davidcalder.ca. Images in the “Uploads” subfolder reveal a number of graphics for use in campaigning.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of one of the images stored in the \"Uploads\" folder.\n\nThe file “database_dump.sql” reveals some of the content that appeared on this site, as seen below, describing Calder and his platform.\n\nSome of the exposed code, containing website content about Calder.\n\nThe WordPress users table once again shows multiple AggregateIQ employees as the administrators.\n\nGreen Party of British Columbia\n\nThe BC Greens are a distinct party which competes against the BC Liberals, the most frequent Canadian client of AggregateIQ seen in these repositories. As reported by Canada’s Global News, the Green Party of British Columbia “contracted AIQ in January 2016 to work on a new voter contact database and a website, but according to the party, the relationship ended by August of that year after it was determined that the project ‘was not meeting’ its priorities.”\n\n\n\nThis abortive partnership may explain why the projects revealed in the repository titled “green-payments-master” seem incomplete. Whereas other projects have web assets such as images of the candidates and content related to their campaign messages, the repository named for the BC Greens contains little more than the bare bones of code for processing online donations. In addition, the associated database was hosted locally, suggesting it may not have ever ultimately been deployed for public use. There are files to to make API calls to a payment processor, Helcim, and send emails via SendGrid, as well as various related requirements like processing cancellations or recurring payments. As with other projects, there are exposed credentials, such as the API token for the payment provider, that should be kept private due to their potential for abuse.\n\nConfig.php with credentials exposed.\n\nOne interesting note is the use of the function name “pillar” in payment.class.php. Elsewhere in AIQ’s Gitlab instance, “Pillar” is the name of a campaign management application which appears to be an improved version of Ripon, which was sold to the 2016 US presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz. The BC Green repository contents has no signs of integration with that project and, as mentioned, shows only the rudimentary scripting for a payment system. It remains unclear exactly what relationship might exist between the Pillar project and this code, where the “pillar” function maps data from one object to another, with comments (seen in the below image on the greyed out lines beginning with //) that may indicate plans for future development.\n\nPayment.class.php with usages of “pillar” that have no apparent integration with AIQ’s other project named Pillar.\n\nThat this project was developed by Aggregate IQ is not in question. The file donate-endpoint.php uses an aggregateiq.com address, and the name of one of AIQ’s developers recurs throughout.\n\nDonate-endpoint.php contains script which includes an AIQ URL and a token.\n\nRequest.test.html shows a test with a developer’s first name.\n\nAndy Wells, Former Mayor of St. John’s, Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nThis folder contains a Wordpress backup for a website configured to run at the web address andywells.ca, loaded with assets related to a longtime Canadian political figure. Unique among the other Canadian politicians found throughout the repository, Andy Wells is not from British Columbia, but from Newfoundland and Labrador, where he served as mayor of the city of St. John’s from 1997 to 2008. Wells also ran unsuccessfully again for mayor of St. John’s in 2017, and it appears to be assets from this campaign that populate the repository bearing Wells’s name.\n\nAt the top level of the “Client-AndyWells-Site” folder are two items of interest: a file, “wordpress.sql,” that is a 6.3 MB WordPress backup of the website “www.andywells.ca,” and a folder titled “webroot.”\n\nAs seen in many of the other repositories, the website backup includes a large amount of boilerplate Wordpress code, as well as customization indicating its utility for andywells.ca and its administration by AIQ employees.\n\nThe statement seen below writes to a table called “wp_options” used to configure the website. Here we see the address, www.andywells.ca, alongside an administrator with an @aggregateiq.com email address.\n\nThe table \"wp_options.\"\n\nThe wp_users table shows additional AIQ staff being added to the database. The timestamps are the “user_registered” dates; the first user’s registration was in October 2016, the second in March 2017.\n\nThe \"wp_users\" table.\n\nThe folder “webroot” contains code and assets for the website. In the folder path “wp-content/uploads/” there are two folders, “2016” and “2017.” In “2016” there is a folder named “10, and in “2016” there are folders named “03,” “08,” and “09”– a naming convention that normally is a function of the month of upload for Wordpress sites. All of these folders contain images, as is the purpose of content upload folders.\n\nIn “2016/10” the assets names describe their purpose. Some of them begin with “action” followed by the action which they would presumably be intended to drive. Others are images of Andy Wells himself.\n\nSome of the image assets exposed.\n\nThere are also further images with names related to “survey.”\n\nIn “2017/08” and “2017/09” more pictures of Wells are present, along with additional stock images. One set, titled “AndyWells-Mail-in-ballot-POINTS,” may refer to other AIQ systems where users earn “points” for certain behaviors, a tool used to further refine targeting.\n\nAnother exposed image file.\n\nOne of the files that departs from generic Wordpress code is the report.php file located at Client-AndyWells-Site/webroot/submit/report.php. This file appears to provides the capability to a report on contacts gathered from andywells.ca, and to provide such reporting for AIQ’s Zack Massingham.\n\nIn particular, this code this generates a report about “surveys,” which suggests a connection to the surveys mentioned above in various asset names. The code in this file reads from the log of forms submissions (the file “form_submits.log\") then makes use of a comma separated value file named “andy_contacts_.” This file provides the code to generate a report on people who have submitted a survey through the site. As it is application code, not a data store of those submissions or log of activity, there is no indication of whether any people submitted these forms. What is clear that code was written to support reporting on such submissions for this website, readable for the aforementioned AIQ administrator.\n\nThe Significance\n\nThe exposure of these repositories is significant for a number of reasons, but perhaps most obvious regards this question: how were web assets for a number of Canadian public servants, designed by a third-party vendor and including such sensitive information as wholly exposed access credentials, made available to anyone entering a web address? The scenario of a malicious actor finding this publicly downloadable data warehouse and using these access credentials to penetrate further into any information gathered into them is all too plausible.\n\nThe potential misuse of any directly or indirectly exposed data emanating from these repositories would certainly be grave. Though public anger may be directed in their direction, it must be noted that the politicians and parties described in this report may be victims as well. With their web assets exposed due to the error of AggregateIQ, a campaign vendor hired to build websites and technical tools, these politicians have suffered from the effects of third-party vendor risk, in which the sharing of information with an insecure partner leads to a digital backlash affecting all parties. Due to a dangerous configuration on the part of the AIQ, this data leaked - an occurrence likely beyond any control or knowledge of the customers affected within. Whether a political operative, private figure, or corporate leader, anyone hiring a firm with which they will share sensitive information must put processes in place to ensure their data will be processed securely.\n\nFinally, given AggregateIQ’s documented ties to Cambridge Analytica, as well as its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories, and its reported work on the Brexit referendum, there is a significant public interest in learning more about how AggregateIQ secures its data, and what data it possesses. The intersection of elected officials with companies accused of playing fast and loose with data privacy is a mounting concern around the world. By informing the public, we hope to further enable citizens to make up their own minds, and secure their own data as well as possible against misuse.",

    "article_text": "AggregateIQ, which played a pivotal role in the Brexit campaign, suspended after reports it may have improperly obtained user data\n\nFacebook has suspended the Canadian data firm with which the official Vote Leave campaign spent 40% of its budget, as the Cambridge Analytica scandal continues to unfold.\n\nOn Friday, Facebook announced it had suspended AggregateIQ (AIQ) from its platform following reports the company may be connected to Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL.\n\nIn its statement, Facebook said: “In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may be affiliated with SCL and may, as a result, have improperly received FB user data, we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate.\n\nFacebook says Cambridge Analytica may have gained 37m more users' data Read more\n\n“Our internal review continues, and we will cooperate fully with any investigations by regulatory authorities.”\n\nThe company played a critical role in Britain’s European Union referendum, with a total of £3.5m being spent on its services by four different campaigns: Vote Leave, BeLeave, Veterans for Britain and Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist party. Additionally, it did work for John Bolton, the newly appointed national security adviser to Donald Trump, and the US senators Thom Tillis and Ted Cruz.\n\nThe Observer first revealed links between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ last May. Two weeks ago, Christopher Wylie, the ex-Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, told how he had helped set up the company when he asked friends in his home town of Victoria, British Columbia, to come and work with Cambridge Analytica. AIQ has denied Wylie had any involvement in setting up the company.\n\nAt that time, AIQ removed a quote from Dominic Cummings, Vote Leave’s chief strategist, from the home page of its website. Previously, it had said: “Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ. We couldn’t have done it without them.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Whistleblower Christopher Wylie has shed light on the alleged links between AggregateIQ and Cambridge Analytica. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nTen days ago, Wylie gave evidence about AIQ to British MPs on the culture, media and sport select committee and also handed over legal documents that showed the connections between it and SCL Elections, including two contracts and an IP licence as well as an email between Jeff Silvester, the cofounder of AIQ, and Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\n\nThe email, about the campaign for Bolton, referenced Aleksandr Kogan and the Facebook data he had harvested on behalf of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nLast week, AIQ told the Observer it was not a direct part and/or the Canadian branch of Cambridge Analytica, and that it had not been involved the exploitation of Facebook data.\n\nThe company is already intertwined in an investigation by the Electoral Commission, which in November reopened an investigation into a donation of £625,000 that Vote Leave had given its youth campaign, BeLeave, saying there were “reasonable grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed”.\n\n'The third era of Zuck': how the CEO went from hero to humiliation Read more\n\nIt is perfectly legal for one campaign to donate to another if they are separate, but the donation went straight from Vote Leave to AIQ, and a second whistleblower, Shahmir Sanni, a 22-year-old volunteer with BeLeave, told the Observer they had no control over how the money was spent. Vote Leave has repeatedly denied the coordination between the campaigns and said the donation was legitimate pursuant to electoral law. When the commission first looked at this in March 2017 it agreed with Vote Leave.\n\nThe information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who is leading another investigation into the use of data in the referendum, said: “AggregateIQ has not been especially cooperative with our investigation. We are taking further steps in that matter.” AIQ says it has answered all the questions put to it by the commission.\n\nPlay Video 10:30 The Brexit whistleblower: 'Not cheating is the core of what it means to be British' – video\n\nBoth Cummings and Darren Grimes, of BeLeave, told the paper they found the firm – which has just 20 staff operating out of a cramped office above an opticians in Victoria, 4,760 miles away – “on the internet”.\n\nHowever cached searches show AggregateIQ did not show up in Google searches at that time and a new source within Vote Leave has come forward to say Cummings had full knowledge of the connections between the two firms. AIQ says it has had a website since it was founded in 2013.\n\nWylie claims the two entities, certainly during the time of the referendum campaign, were operating closely, though this has been strongly denied by AIQ. “Among internal CA [Cambridge Analytica] staff AIQ was referred to as ‘our Canadian office’. They were treated as a department within the company,” he said. They were both working on Cruz’s presidential campaign at the time, he said, and were in daily contact.\n\nSilvester said Cambridge Analytica was not in contact with AIQ during the referendum campaign. “AIQ never worked or even communicated in any way with Cambridge Analytica or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica with respect to the Brexit campaign. Any claim that we shared Vote Leave data with Cambridge Analytica or anyone else in any way is entirely false.”\n\nAIQ has yet to release a statement in relation to the suspension.",

    "article_text": "Cambridge Analytica has undisclosed links to the Canadian digital firm AggregateIQ that played a pivotal role in the official Vote Leave campaign in 2016, which was headed by the environment secretary Michael Gove and the foreign secretary Boris Johnson, the Observer has learned.\n\nChristopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee turned whistleblower, has revealed that as well as playing a part in setting up the firm – which is now facing increasing scrutiny from investigators on both sides of the Atlantic over its role in harvesting Facebook data – he was also a central figure in setting up AIQ, which accounted for 40% of Vote Leave’s campaign budget.\n\nThe Observer first disclosed connections between the firms a year ago when it published details of an intellectual property licence that linked AIQ and SCL Elections, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIn public, the official Leave campaign and Nigel Farage’s Leave.EU campaign were quite separate and appeared hostile to each other. But the connections between the two data firms raise fresh questions about possible overlaps between the two campaigns.\n\nWylie said that, in 2016, the relationship went far beyond that. Although AIQ and Cambridge Analytica appeared separate, the two were bound by a skein of threads so intimate that some Cambridge Analytica staff referred to the Canadian data firm as a “department” within the company. Wylie said that the two businesses shared the same underlying technology.\n\n“AIQ wouldn’t exist without me,” he said. “When I became research director for SCL [the parent company of Cambridge Analytica] we needed to rapidly expand our technical capacity and I reached out to a lot of people I had worked with in the past.”\n\nThat included Jeff Silvester, his former boss, who lived in Wylie’s home town – Victoria, capital of the province of British Columbia. Wylie suggested Silvester should work for the firm in London. “But he had just had a family and wasn’t keen to go to London,” he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest AggregateIQ’s Zack Massingham, left, with Vote Leave’s Stephen Parkinson pictured in the campaign’s London office.\n\nThe Observer has seen an email from 11 August 2013 that Wylie sent to Silvester about SCL. “We mostly do psychological warfare work for Nato,” he said. “But a lot of projects involve a socio-political element.”\n\nSilvester replied: “You need a Canadian office.”\n\nHe then set up AIQ with his business partner, Zack Massingham, to work on SCL and later Cambridge Analytica projects. “Essentially it was set up as a Canadian entity for people who wanted to work on SCL projects who didn’t want to move to London. That’s how AIQ got started: originally to service SCL and Cambridge Analytica projects,” said Wylie.\n\nLast March, when the Observer started asking questions about the connection between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ, the former removed “SCL Canada” and Massingham’s phone number from its website and said that AIQ was a “former IT contractor”.\n\nCambridge Analytica is already under scrutiny for its work for Farage’s Leave.EU campaign, and AIQ is also involved in an investigation by the Electoral Commission into Vote Leave.\n\nOn Saturday the Information Commissioner, Elizabeth Denham said that “AggregateIQ has not been especially co-operative with our investigation. We are taking further steps in that matter.”\n\nThe mystery of how Vote Leave even found AIQ, a firm with just 20 staff that operated 4,760 miles away out of a cramped office above an opticians in the Canadian city of Victoria, was raised by the Observer last May.\n\nDom Cummings, the chief strategist for Vote Leave, told this newspaper that he found the firm “on the internet”. But cached searches show that AIQ had no internet presence at that time and a new source within Vote Leave has come forward to say that Cummings had full knowledge of the connections between the two firms.\n\n“The idea that Dom had no idea of AIQ’s connection to Cambridge Analytica is complete bullshit,” said the source. “It was a former Cambridge Analytica employee who made the introduction. He knew exactly how the two companies operated together. He knew they’d worked together on the [former candidate for the Republican nomination for president] Ted Cruz campaign and that they shared the same underlying technology,” said the source.\n\nBut Cummings told this newspaper: “Vote Leave data never went anywhere near Cambridge Analytica and your repeated attempts to show that Vote Leave and Cambridge Analytica were somehow secretly coordinating is not just without foundation but the opposite of the truth.”\n\nUntil 2016, AIQ had no clients other than Cambridge Analytica. The lack of a website, Wylie claims, was because at the time of the referendum it was operating almost as “an internal department of Cambridge Analytica. It didn’t have a website and no contact number. The only public contact number was SCL’s website.” However, AIQ says it has had a website since it was founded in 2013.\n\nWylie said that AIQ managed Cambridge Analytica’s technology platform – Ripon – and its databases. “Because AIQ was operating internally, almost as a department of Cambridge Analytica, it didn’t have a website and no contact number. The only public contact number was SCL’s website,” said Wylie.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Screengrab taken at 2pm on Tuesday from AIQ’s homepage. By Thursday, after the company was contacted by the Observer, it had been taken down. Photograph: AggregateIQ\n\nHe said AIQ also had its intellectual property owned by Cambridge Analytica. “AIQ often traded as SCL Canada for ages and although a technically separate company, the IP [intellectual property] was retained by Cambridge Analytica and SCL.\n\n“They were the ones that took a lot of data that Cambridge Analytica would acquire and the algorithms they build and translated that into the actual physical targeting online, they [AIQ] were the bit that actually disseminated stuff. AIQ managed the Ripon platform, which is Cambridge Analytica’s platform, and built a lot of the tech that would connect the algorithms to social and online advertising networks.”\n\nWylie claims that the two entities, certainly during the time of the referendum campaign, were operating closely. “Among internal CA staff AIQ was referred to as ‘our Canadian office’. They were treated as a department within the company,” he said.\n\nCummings would later say: “Without a doubt, the Vote Leave campaign owes a great deal of its success to the work of AggregateIQ. We couldn’t have done it without them.” His quote, emblazoned on the AIQ website for more than a year, disappeared on Thursday.\n\nSilvester said that Cambridge Analytica was not in contact with AIQ during the referendum campaign. “AIQ never worked or even communicated in any way with Cambridge Analytica or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica with respect to the Brexit campaign. Any claim that we shared Vote Leave data with Cambridge Analytica or anyone else in any way is entirely false.”\n\nHe added: “AggregateIQ has always been 100% Canadian owned and operated.”\n\n• This article was updated on 27 March 2018 to clarify which SCL Group company AIQ’s intellectual property was licensed to; and on 29 March to clarify that Victoria, on Vancouver Island, is the capital of the province of British Columbia and is 4,760 miles, not 2,300 miles, from London.\n\n\n\n• Addendum, 29 March 2018: we are happy to clarify that we did not intend to suggest that AggregateIQ is a direct part and/or the Canadian branch of Cambridge Analytica or that it has been involved in the exploitation of Facebook data or otherwise in any of the alleged wrongdoing made against Cambridge Analytica. Further we did not intend to suggest that AIQ secretly and unethically coordinated with Cambridge Analytica on the EU Referendum.\n\n",

    "article_text": "2:55 p.m. EDT\n\nMS NAUERT: Hi, everybody.\n\nQUESTION: Hello.\n\nMS NAUERT: Hi. Good afternoon. Welcome.\n\nSo you may see some very young, fresh faces in the building today, and that’s because – yes, of course, I’m talking about Michelle here.\n\nQUESTION: The new Trump political appointees?\n\nMS NAUERT: No, just a little bit younger, Michelle. We have a new A-100 class that started this week, so we’re thrilled to welcome them. They’re not in the room with us here today, but they are here at the State Department and also over at the Foreign Service Institute. We have welcomed this week the 193rd Foreign Service Generalist Class on March 19th.\n\nThirty-six officers are in this class, in the A-100 training class over at FSI for the rest of the week. The class includes a number of distinguished veterans in U.S. Armed Forces, former Peace Corps volunteers, and former employees of various government agencies. In the private sector, they’ve worked as researchers, analysts, students, lawyers, entrepreneurs, and also contractors. Also included are two Thomas Pickering Foreign Affairs Fellows – one in the political career track, and one in the public diplomacy track. Almost all the class has post-graduate degrees, and many have worked, studied, or volunteered abroad. The languages spoken by the group include French, Romanian, Swahili, Tagalog, Spanish, Hindi, Czech, Japanese, and – well, there are a whole lot of others that I won’t --\n\nQUESTION: Tagalog.\n\nMS NAUERT: -- that I won’t – thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Tagalog.\n\nMS NAUERT: Thank you. So welcome to this class. And we look forward to seeing them around, and perhaps we can invite them to a briefing some day while they’re up there if they’re bored and want to join us.\n\nNext I’d like to mention the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to the United States. We would like to warmly welcome him on his visit to the United States. As you likely saw, the President met with the crown prince just a short while ago. Our Deputy Secretary John Sullivan was also over at the White House for a lunch in his honor earlier today.\n\nSaudi Arabia is a key partner and a longtime friend of the United States. The U.S.-Saudi relationship has evolved and strengthened since 1940, when our two countries first established full diplomatic ties. Saudi Arabia’s security is a priority for the United States, and we work closely with our Saudi partners to counter the threatening behavior of dangerous actors in the region. The visit provides an important opportunity for discussions on a wide range of regional and bilateral issues. We look forward to further strengthening U.S.-Saudi relationship and advancing our common security and economic priorities.\n\nAnd lastly, I’d like to draw your attention to the ongoing humanitarian crisis taking place in Venezuela. Effective immediately, the United States is increasing its humanitarian assistance to Venezuelans who are in Colombia, who were forced to leave their own country due to the ongoing crisis created by the Maduro regime. USAID is providing a new initial immediate assistance – excuse me, initial immediate assistance – which totals $2.5 million in partnership with the Government of Colombia. That funding is in addition to $36.5 million that the State Department is providing in Fiscal Years 2017 and 2018 to support the regional humanitarian operations of UNHCR and other international organizations. The operations include assistance for Venezuelans who are now residing outside of their country.\n\nWe applaud the government and the people of Colombia for the compassion in hosting hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans who’ve fled their country. The United States stands with the hemisphere and democratic nations around the world in support of the Venezuelan people, wherever they may be. We will continue to closely monitor the crisis. And we are aware that UNHCR has issued an appeal for funding, and we are now considering that additional funding.\n\nAnd with that, I’d be happy to take your questions.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks.\n\nMS NAUERT: Hi, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Hello. Happy Tuesday.\n\nMS NAUERT: Tuesday.\n\nQUESTION: Just briefly, very briefly on the A-100 class --\n\nMS NAUERT: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: This is the first of the year, correct?\n\nMS NAUERT: Yes, it is.\n\nQUESTION: And how many more are planned?\n\nMS NAUERT: I don’t know the answer to that, but we’re happy to have the first one, and if I can find out how many more classes will be announced, I will let you know.\n\nQUESTION: And – that and any progress made on the strategic hiring. Is that still a thing since the Secretary has gone?\n\nMS NAUERT: Which the – the hiring --\n\nQUESTION: SHI – the SHI, SHI?\n\nMS NAUERT: The hiring freeze, is that what you mean?\n\nQUESTION: No, the Strategic Hiring Initiative that was announced by the deputy secretary a couple weeks ago.\n\nMS NAUERT: And this is where we can bring on people on an as needed --\n\nQUESTION: The end of the hiring freeze.\n\nMS NAUERT: -- on an as-needed basis. I believe --\n\nQUESTION: I’m just wondering if there’s --\n\nMS NAUERT: -- I believe that that is all ongoing, but I’ll double-check the details and provide them to you.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Because I just would like to know if there’s any impact that has – if that has any impact on the A-100 class.\n\nMS NAUERT: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: Now, let’s start with --\n\nMS NAUERT: They’ve got a lot of work ahead of them, though, those A-100 students do.\n\nQUESTION: Oh, I’m sure they do. I’m sure they do. Let’s start with Russia, given --\n\nMS NAUERT: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: -- the fact that I don’t believe you guys have said anything yet – this building has not said anything yet – about the election over the weekend. What did you make of it?\n\nMS NAUERT: Yeah. I think I would first draw attention to the fact that it’s simply no surprise that Vladimir Putin was reelected and that he remains the leader of Russia. We have talked for a long time here about the clampdown on many of the freedoms that people should enjoy in Russia and have not been able to enjoy. We’re watching closely the monitors who were involved in the election – the gold standard of monitors, the OSCE monitors. They have issued a preliminary report on the election. We have no reason to doubt that the report’s conclusions are incorrect. We have every reason to believe that the conclusions are correct.\n\nI’d like to read for you a – just an excerpt from their preliminary report. The OSCE ODIHR team noted that the election in Russia “took place in an overly controlled legal and political environment, marked by continued pressure on critical voices… Restrictions on…fundamental freedoms… resulted in a lack of genuine competition… [and] an uneven playing field.” We saw on the news over the weekend that some people were paid to turn out to vote. We’ve seen that opposition leaders have been intimidated, jailed, and other things of the sort. So I would just draw us back to the OSCE preliminary report. We will review that report. We’ll take a look at their final report when it comes out.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. So just a little aside, ODIHR --\n\nMS NAUERT: Mm-hmm.\n\nQUESTION: We like to call it “oh dear.”\n\nMS NAUERT: Oh, thank you, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nMS NAUERT: I’ll tell you, Matt – Matt should be doing this job. What are you doing sitting down there, Matt?\n\nQUESTION: This is very – this is a bit of a contrast here between what you just said and what was not said at the White House a little while ago, what was not said in the President’s phone call with President Putin, at least according to what the White House said. Does this mean your acceptance – your endorsement of the ODIHR assessment – does that mean that you do not believe that the Russian – that this election was a free and fair one?\n\nMS NAUERT: I think that we would agree with the OSCE and its preliminary report. Again, it’s preliminary. We’ve seen all the news that has come out of Russia. I would direct you back to the readout that the White House provided of the President’s phone call with Vladimir Putin. Just because you see certain words in a readout does not mean that the call wasn’t more comprehensive than the readout that was provided.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. But one --\n\nMS NAUERT: We’ve seen that on many occasions at the State Department, where a readout just provides somewhat of a limited scope or description of a phone call.\n\nQUESTION: Right. But, I mean, one thing that the President said himself but also was in the statement was that he had congratulated President Putin on his victory. Is that something the State Department shares --\n\nMS NAUERT: You know what? I would say that that’s called protocol. And there are many countries from around the world that when someone wins, if you will, an election, that you pick up the phone and you place that phone call. We saw that from Macron; we’ve seen that from other world leaders who have done the same thing with Vladimir Putin. People call the United States when we participate in an election and win an election. So I’d just say that’s standard.\n\nQUESTION: Well, but --\n\nMS NAUERT: Look, there’s one thing that we have to do. Whether folks like it or not, we have a relationship with the Russian Government. That is just a part of the world. That is just simply a reality. That does not mean that we agree with them on everything. That does not mean that we get along on every single issue. We have been very clear about calling them out for their responsibility of the horrific attacks that have continued to take place in Eastern Ghouta, in Syria, and we hold Russia accountable for that. So I want to be clear that we call out Russia when they are responsible for an action and we will not hesitate to do so. But the reality is that we are two nuclear powers, two superpowers in this world, and we still have to be able to pick up the phone and have a dialogue and conversation with one another.\n\nQUESTION: Well, that’s okay. That’s understood. But the OSCE didn’t come out with a damning report about the French presidential election. You don’t – I don’t remember the President calling up President Maduro of Venezuela after he won in what you guys said was a sham election last year. I can’t remember any president calling up President Mugabe and saying, “Congrats on your Zimbabwe election” over the course of decades, until he was finally ousted. So I just don’t --\n\nMS NAUERT: Well, Matt, I can give you the phone numbers to reach Angela Merkel, also Macron, and --\n\nQUESTION: Oh, if you got their cell --\n\nMS NAUERT: -- the President of the United States. You can call them and ask them why those world leaders and others did this as well. The reality is we have to have a relationship, whether folks like it or not.\n\nQUESTION: Did you get Chancellor Merkel’s number from the NSA or somewhere – someone else? (Laughter.)\n\nMS NAUERT: I’ll see – very funny. I’ll see where I – yeah.\n\nQUESTION: And just the last thing on this.\n\nMS NAUERT: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: When she was asked if – that you guys thought that the election was free and fair, your colleague Sarah Sanders said, “We don’t get to dictate how other countries operate.” Does this – I mean, no one is saying that the United States dictates how other countries operate, but you do call them out. And you seem to have called them out here, despite what the – what was not said at the White House. So I’m just wondering, when the Human Rights Reports come out later on this month, potentially, or next month, is there going to be criticism or a recognition of shortcomings in other countries’ elections, regardless of Russia --\n\nMS NAUERT: Well, that Human Rights Report has not been released just yet. We look forward to releasing it in the coming weeks. We don’t have a date for it just yet. It is not – it has not been finalized at this point, so I’m not going to preview what’s in it. And by the way, it’s big, thick, and I haven’t taken a look at all the details yet.\n\nQUESTION: You’re not removing the United States from the – from criticizing elections that don’t meet international standards, are you?\n\nMS NAUERT: The State Department – the State Department does this. We will certainly call out other countries, where other countries are responsible for bad actions. That hasn’t changed. That doesn’t change administration to administration.\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nMS NAUERT: Lesley, go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: So Heather, by the President calling and congratulating President Putin, was he actually saying that he then accepts that he is the new leader of Russia?\n\nMS NAUERT: As you know, I’m not over at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I’m right here. So I’d have to refer you to the White House for that. I was not on the call, I don’t know the tone, I don’t know what was said in the call beyond what was released in the readout and knowing that they also addressed some other matters, such as Syria and other things that were not included in the readout.\n\nQUESTION: Right. Has there been anything from this department to the Russian Government as far as reaching out and saying that they – you don’t necessarily agree with them.\n\nMS NAUERT: Not that I’m – not that I am aware of. I’m sure our embassy has had contact with the government, I would imagine. But I don’t have anything specific to provide you.\n\nQUESTION: And then I have a follow-up. So if you – if the congratulatory phone call to President Putin from Donald Trump accepts that he is the new president, do you expect – and also this was the same week that the U.S. – well, actually was it? Today is Wednesday. I think it was Friday where the U.S. added sanctions to – against Russian officials.\n\nMS NAUERT: That was last week, yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Correct.\n\nMS NAUERT: Last Thursday.\n\nQUESTION: Correct. Do you expect President Putin to soften his stance towards U.S. – do you expect President Putin to be less aggressive towards the U.S. now, or do you see the U.S. continuing to up its pressure on Russia through sanctions?\n\nMS NAUERT: Well, sanctions remain a tool in the toolkit of the United States and many other countries. It’s something that we don’t hesitate to use. Whether it’s sanctions related to CAATSA – that’s what was announced last week – we don’t preview our sanctions, but keep an eye on what will be coming forward in the coming weeks and months with regard to the United States and Russia.\n\nWe have put sanctions in place as a result of Russia’s activities in Ukraine. We, as many of you will recall, kicked out diplomats last year, or not that long ago. We also shuttered some of their buildings here in the United States, to much criticism from many in the press who accused us of being overly aggressive in asking the Russians to leave and in closing down some of those buildings.\n\nSo we will take those actions and won’t hesitate to take those actions when they’re necessary and we believe they’re correct to do so. Okay. Hi, Michelle.\n\nQUESTION: Thanks. Speaking of holding Russia accountable, how would you describe the process as it stands right now for punishing or taking action against Russia for the spy poisoning?\n\nMS NAUERT: I’m sorry. Say that again?\n\nQUESTION: Well, how would you describe where the process is right now in terms of looking at possibly taking action against Russia after the poisoning in the U.K.?\n\nMS NAUERT: I think I just addressed that with Leslie. Let me back up for just a minute and say we stand firmly by our ally, firmly by the Brits. We have every reason to believe their accounting and their concerns, as do many other countries as well, about what took place against the – the gentleman living in the U.K.\n\nSo you saw the statement that was put out by the EU. NATO put out a statement, as well as did the Quad. So many other countries share out tremendous concerns about this activity that Russia took against this individual and his daughter living in the United Kingdom. So we understand and support what the British Government has chosen to do in terms of kicking out the Russian diplomats from its country.\n\nAs I just said to Leslie a minute ago, we’re not going to preview some of our activities, but we are watching closely and we may be taking action.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. And what would – because the U.S. at this point believes the U.K.’s assessment, has no reason to disbelieve it, how does that make Russia any different from say North Korea, which has now been designated a state sponsor of terror for a very similar assassination.\n\nMS NAUERT: Right, we covered this last week. You may recall that under the chemical weapons treaty, that North Korea was determined to be out of compliance with that treaty obligation, and that is because North Korea used a weapon, a chemical agent, against Kim Jong-un’s – I always forget – half-brother or step brother? Half-brother. Thank you – used that. It was not something that was put in place right away, sanctions against North Korea. So some of that can take some time. We evaluate, we assess, and then we put in place sanctions. I’m not going to rule out that that won’t happen in the future. Okay?\n\nQUESTION: Thank you.\n\nQUESTION: Can I move on?\n\nMS NAUERT: Hi. Said, hi.\n\nQUESTION: Wait – some Russia?\n\nQUESTION: Yes --\n\nMS NAUERT: Oh, okay. Said, let me come – let me – I’ll come back to you. Okay? We’ll do Said next.\n\nQUESTION: Okay.\n\nMS NAUERT: Hey, Laurie.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Hi, just on Russia. The British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said that over the past decade, Russia has stockpiled nerve agents. That’s not some simple small thing. Do you agree with that assessment that Russia has been stockpiling some significant amount of nerve agents?\n\nMS NAUERT: I’m not sure that we have a final conclusion on that. We know that Russia has declared some of its stockpiles, but I want to be clear that sometimes countries will not declare everything that they have. This is something that the United States will closely evaluate.\n\nQUESTION: So you don’t accept as conclusive the Organization for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons’ determination that Russia had destroyed everything last fall? That’s not a conclusive determination?\n\nMS NAUERT: Well, no. What I said is “declared,” and that’s the key word, what a country has declared. We believe that they have destroyed their declared stockpile, but whether or not there was something that perhaps was undeclared, that could be a different story. Okay? Said, hi.\n\nQUESTION: Yes, I want to go to the Palestinian issue. Do you have any reaction to the speech by Palestinian Authority President Abbas in which he levied a direct insult on the American ambassador?\n\nMS NAUERT: Yeah. I had a chance to meet with Ambassador Friedman last week and had dinner at his home, and spent some time with my colleagues in Tel Aviv and also for a short period of time in Jerusalem. I can say when I saw the comments that came out by Mahmoud Abbas – I mean, you look at that, it’s a terrible thing to say about anyone. It’s a terrible thing to say about a U.S. official. So comments like that are not only rude, but they’re unhelpful. They’re unhelpful because this administration would like to see an – pardon me, an Israeli and Palestinian peace process. What he said is – hampers the ability, we believe, to have the Israelis and Palestinians sit down and have a conversation together to work out a peace process.\n\nWhat they should focus their ire on is the horrific situation that has been unfolding for residents in Gaza. You and I have talked about this on numerous occasions – the difficulties with electricity, with clean water, and all of that. Our colleague Felicia Schwartz back here knows that well since she’s spent quite a bit of time in Israel lately, which – by the way, can I say congratulations?\n\nQUESTION: Not yet.\n\nMS NAUERT: No? Nothing? Okay. All right, never mind. Disregard that.\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nMS NAUERT: In any event, so my point is, Said, that kind of comment is unhelpful.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Let me ask you, conversely --\n\nMS NAUERT: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: -- but the ambassador said he – he said that President Abbas was anti-Semitic for saying what he said about him. Is that tantamount to anti-Semitism?\n\nMS NAUERT: I haven’t seen that part of the – I haven’t seen that part of the comment, but it’s certainly --\n\nQUESTION: Do you know – right.\n\nMS NAUERT: -- not a kind thing that he said.\n\nQUESTION: Right, right, okay. And basically, the context in which Abbas was talking was talking about what seems to be sort of an encouragement or support for settlement activities in the West Bank by the U.S. ambassador. Are you worried that there is a creeping annexation in the West Bank by their building settlements?\n\nMS NAUERT: Said, we’ve talked about this so many times, I want to just hit the play-button, about settlements. And the President’s position on settlements has been clear that we do not believe that unrestrained settlement activity advances the cause for peace or the prospect for peace, and we’ve made that position clear to the government over there.\n\nQUESTION: So there is an asymmetry between the position of the White House and the position of the American ambassador to Israel?\n\nMS NAUERT: Look, we are all on the same page with regard to this. That is the administration’s policy and that’s what we work on from this building. Okay?\n\nQUESTION: And one last thing, I promise.\n\nMS NAUERT: And then I’m going to – and Said, last one, then I’m going to have to move on.\n\nQUESTION: Right. I want to ask you about the young Palestinian teenager, Ahed Tamimi, who is being refused a public trial. She’s being tried behind closed doors for slapping an Israeli soldier. Do you have any comment on that? Are you concerned?\n\nMS NAUERT: Yeah. I mean, I’m certainly aware of her case. You and I have talked about this before. We believe that people should have the right to a fair trial. Beyond that, Said, I’d just have to refer you to the Government of Israel for just the details on her particular case.\n\nMiss, hi. Remind me, your name is?\n\nQUESTION: Zuzanna.\n\nQUESTION: Can we stay --\n\nMS NAUERT: Zuzanna, hold on one second.\n\nQUESTION: -- on the Abbas comment just for a second?\n\nMS NAUERT: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: No doubt that what was said was offensive and terrible, but I mean, is this administration really in a position to take the moral high ground that it seems to be taking when the President of the United States routinely insults his political opponents, routinely denigrates members of the press and others and with language that is in some cases harsher than what President Abbas – what President Abbas used?\n\nMS NAUERT: Matt, I think I would go back to one of the main tenets that we support here at the State Department, and that is not only the right to a free press but also the right to free speech. And I may not like and others may not like what Mahmoud Abbas had said about our ambassador. I don’t think it’s right. As a mom, as a woman, as a citizen of the United States, I don’t like hearing that about our ambassador. But we believe also in the right to free speech and that includes for our President as well. Okay?\n\nQUESTION: Okay. So then there won’t be any, quote-unquote, “punishment” for President Abbas for using his right to free speech in this case?\n\nMS NAUERT: I’m not aware of any whatsoever.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. Thank you.\n\nMS NAUERT: Okay? Okay. Go right ahead. Sorry, miss.\n\nQUESTION: So Heather, a few days ago, 39 senators sent a letter to Acting Secretary John Sullivan in which they stressed their opposition towards Nord Stream 2 --\n\nMS NAUERT: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: -- and encouraged the administration to utilize old tools at its disposal, including a provision in the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act to prevent construction of the Nord Stream 2. A week before, Russian newspaper Kommersant informed that the U.S. has no appetite for introducing sanctions on Nord Stream 2. Do you think that, should the sanctions be introduced, of course, they could have a serious impact on the project and companies which are engaged in construction and financing of the projects like Nord Stream 2 or Turkish Stream 2?\n\nMS NAUERT: Sure. So one of the things you’re talking about is CAATSA, and at the State Department, we’ve spent a lot of time speaking with our partners and allies in other countries overseas to explain to them the ramifications of CAATSA and how an individual or a company or a country could run afoul against CAATSA and fall into sanctions. So in general, as a general matter as you all know, we don’t tend to comment on sanctions actions, but we’ve been clear that firms that work in the Russian energy export pipeline sector could – if they engage in that kind of business, they could expose themselves to sanctions under CAATSA.\n\nAs many people know, we oppose the Nord Stream 2 project; the United States Government does. We believe that the Nord Stream 2 project would undermine Europe’s overall energy security and stability. It would provide Russia another tool to pressure European countries, especially countries such as Ukraine. We’ve seen that – what Russia has done in the past, when they’ve turned off the pipeline in the middle of winter, causing some families to not have heat, not have the oil that they need to stay warm or cook their food, and we think that that is simply wrong. Okay, thank you.\n\nQUESTION: I thought that there was --\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nMS NAUERT: Sorry. Rich, hi.\n\nQUESTION: Hi, Heather. Just a quick one on Pakistan. Has Pakistan come any closer to satisfying the conditions the United States has laid out to unfreeze the aid that was frozen? Any progress update on that relationship?\n\nMS NAUERT: Sure. So we made an announcement – I believe it was late last year – my days get a little confused sometimes – about that freeze in the foreign military assistance for Pakistan. One of the things that the President has called for in his South Asia strategy is for Pakistan to take on greater responsibility for cracking down on terror groups. And we’ve certainly seen Pakistan take some positive steps in the right direction, but a lot more needs to be done, in terms of Pakistan cracking down not just on the Taliban, but the Haqqani Network and other terror networks as well.\n\nMike – Vice President Mike Pence met with the Prime Minister Abbasi of Pakistan just on Friday of last week. They talked about the overall South Asia strategy, the administration’s South Asia strategy, and that’s one of the things that the Vice President addressed with him. He said the Government of Pakistan has to do more to address the continued presence of terrorism in Pakistan. There’s a lot more that they can do, but they can also play a critical role in the – with the Taliban in getting the Taliban to come to the table in Pakistan.\n\nQUESTION: So encouraged by some steps, and then – and what you were saying, the improvement, that has to do specifically with terror networks?\n\nMS NAUERT: That is one of the key points, yes. Mm-hmm. Okay. Hi, Janne.\n\nQUESTION: Hi. Thank you very much. On North Korea, two questions on North Korea, quick questions.\n\nMS NAUERT: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: Did you get any signal that North Korea has decided to release the U.S. detainees?\n\nMS NAUERT: I don’t have anything for you on that. You know that the American citizens who are being held all around the world are – remains one of the top priorities of this administration. When the President first came into office, that was something that he directed the State Department to do, to best oversee the welfare, the care, and bringing home of American citizens who are being held overseas. We do have Americans there. You all know that, but I don’t have anything new for you on that.\n\nQUESTION: So any optimistic or pessimistic signal from Ri Yong-ho talks with the Swedish ambassador in Sweden?\n\nMS NAUERT: We don’t have anything on that. We were not a part of those talks in Sweden. Alicia, do you have a – Alicia, I know you want to get a question in earlier rather than later. Do you have anything today?\n\nQUESTION: Actually, just following up on that.\n\nMS NAUERT: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: Ambassador Yun on CNN last week said that he had reached out to the North Koreans and urged them to release the Americans. Was that a message that was coordinated with the State Department?\n\nMS NAUERT: Not that I am aware of. If he did, I have no confirmation of him actually doing that. I saw part of the report that you’re referencing, but I just don’t have any confirmation as to whether or not he did that. We certainly hope that our people would be able to come home, though.\n\nQUESTION: He also said that he would work for this administration again if asked. Is that at all being considered?\n\nMS NAUERT: Not that I’m aware of. We have our colleagues firmly in place, and they are doing a great job. And we are pleased to have Mark Lambert having picked up Ambassador Yun’s responsibilities, and also Susan Thornton and others taking on that role. So they’re working hard on that portfolio.\n\nQUESTION: North Korea.\n\nMS NAUERT: Hey.\n\nQUESTION: So still on that topic just to --\n\nMS NAUERT: Yes.\n\nQUESTION: -- clarify something. The – there was a news report from MBC TV in Seoul – so South Korean media – that Pyongyang and Washington were working on an agreement to release the three U.S. citizens held there. So can you confirm that that report is incorrect?\n\nMS NAUERT: Yeah. A bunch of you e-mailed me about that over the weekend, and I think that’s just purely speculation at this point. We would love to have our American citizens brought home – a huge priority for this administration – but as far as we’re concerned there’s nothing underway. We would all – however though, I want to be clear about how much we’d like our people to come home.\n\nQUESTION: Sorry, I – has Mark actually taken over that job?\n\nMS NAUERT: Not officially, but he’s handling that portfolio, as is Susan Thornton. All right. Dave, hi.\n\nQUESTION: Hi. The State Department Global Engagement Center has a contract with a British company, Strategic Communications Laboratories, to provide support to their – well, the GEC stuff, the counterpropaganda effort. SCL Limited has been kicked off the Facebook platform because it’s the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. Can it continue to do its work without access to the Facebook platform, and do you share the concerns that Facebook have – has that it’s been misusing user data?\n\nMS NAUERT: So I’m certainly aware of that report. What our relationship with that company – the Global Engagement Center entered in a contract with Strategic Communications Laboratories. That is a division or a sister company of this Cambridge Analytica. The State Department has never worked with Cambridge Analytica, so I want to make that clear.\n\nThe type of work that they have done for the Global Engagement Center is not related to social media. We do not take social media information. What – the way that we have engaged them is we have hired them overseas in other countries to conduct in-person interviews. Part of our – the portfolio that they have handled for us is the de-radicalization, essentially, of people who would be interested in joining ISIS. So the company has engaged with people who have either left the battlefield or people who might be prime for joining groups of that nature, and we’ve gotten information from them and talked with them about it. So it’s not a social media-based thing.\n\nQUESTION: Okay. But – and it isn’t in the social media that they’re accused of unethical practices, but they have been accused of unethical practices. Do you have any concerns about them as a company?\n\nMS NAUERT: Look, it’s not my place to weigh in on what this company is alleged to have done in a space that we have not engaged them. They’ve done that work with other companies, other entities that we have not been a part of. We engaged them in a very specific way to interview people who we thought were at risk as a part of our way of retraining people’s minds or getting people to not jump into terrorism.\n\nQUESTION: And the contract was a year long and it was signed in February, so it ought to have expired. Has it continued or has it been renewed?\n\nMS NAUERT: As far as I know, the contract was signed in 2016 – in November of 2016. I believe that contract has not expired just yet. Hold on, let me see what I have in here. Yeah, so the contract was signed in November 2016. I believe they’re putting together their final reports at this time, and we just always closely review our contracts as they go forward.\n\nQUESTION: So in other words, this was – this contract was signed by the previous administration?\n\nMS NAUERT: That is correct.\n\nQUESTION: How did they find those people that they were interviewing?\n\nMS NAUERT: I don’t know. I don’t – and I’m not sure that we would even give the specifics because some of this would probably fall under sensitive information about the countries in which some of these people were operating.\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nQUESTION: The reason I ask is because some of – when I did the article about the Global Engagement Center a couple – two weeks ago --\n\nMS NAUERT: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: -- they talked about a very similar project that actually used Facebook to get in touch with those people.\n\nMS NAUERT: I’m not aware of that, then.\n\nQUESTION: So was this the first time --\n\nQUESTION: So would that have been a different project?\n\nMS NAUERT: I’m not aware of that, what you just referenced. This is – that’s the first I’ve heard of it. Okay?\n\nQUESTION: So was this the first time that the State Department or a State Department branch has hired this company, SCL, or any of its subsidiaries?\n\nMS NAUERT: My colleagues who predate me here at the State Department have told me that we have hired or have worked with SCL in the past.\n\nQUESTION: Doing?\n\nMS NAUERT: That I’m not sure. I think similar kinds of programs in the past.\n\nQUESTION: And are you --\n\nMS NAUERT: And I know that many other governments work with them as well. It’s not just the United States Government. I believe the Brits work with them and other countries.\n\nQUESTION: Given the success, if you will, questionable legal or whatever that they – that their other companies seem to have had with social media, one might wonder why social media wasn’t – they seem to be good at doing that – whether it’s --\n\nMS NAUERT: Matt, I’m sorry. I wasn’t here at the time. I don’t have any information on why the decision was made back in November 2016 to engage them in this kind of fashion and not in a social media – have them work on social media.\n\nQUESTION: Last thing very briefly: Can you explain how it is that it seems to – if this contract was in fact signed in November 2016, how did the – was there confusion that this contract was actually signed in February of 2017?\n\nMS NAUERT: I don’t know. I don’t know.\n\nQUESTION: That’s what – it’s on a government contracting website. Defense One found it yesterday.\n\nMS NAUERT: Okay.\n\nQUESTION: And it said --\n\nMS NAUERT: Robert, do you have anything more on that?\n\nMR GREENAN: I think they’ll – usually, in a contract they have a beginning work period and I think that beginning of the work period was defined as February 2017.\n\nQUESTION: Oh, okay.\n\nMR GREENAN: But the agreement to engage that contract was made in November of 2016.\n\nQUESTION: So it was three – okay, is that typical for – maybe I should get my – into government contracting. You’re at three --\n\nMS NAUERT: I think I’m going to have to learn more about how government contracting works.\n\nQUESTION: They were getting paid for three months without doing any work?\n\nMR GREENAN: No, your period of work began on February, so your payments began in February.\n\nQUESTION: Oh. All right.\n\nMS NAUERT: Okay. Anything more on that for you, we’ll let you know. Okay?\n\nGo right ahead. Hey.\n\nQUESTION: Turkey. Today, Turkish Presidential Spokesperson Kalin said that – reiterated that the U.S. and Turkey have reached an agreement over Manbij and he said the implementation of Manbij deal would be delayed for a couple of weeks until the new secretary takes over.\n\nMS NAUERT: Well, that’s funny, because no agreement has been reached. All right. We’re going to have to wrap it up shortly.\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nMS NAUERT: Pardon me?\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, (inaudible) earlier in your discussion with Matt about the U.S. doesn’t dictate to other countries. It’s the 15th anniversary of the Iraq war, and of course, the --\n\nMS NAUERT: I don’t think that I said – I don’t think that I said to Matt that we don’t dictate to other countries.\n\nQUESTION: It might have been him. I wasn’t sure.\n\nMS NAUERT: I think Matt said that.\n\nQUESTION: It’s hard to tell.\n\nQUESTION: I was quoting the --\n\nMS NAUERT: Yeah, yeah, he --\n\nQUESTION: -- the White House spokeswoman.\n\nMS NAUERT: Yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Should the U.S. apologize for regime change operations from meddling in elections in multiple countries through many means over the years?\n\nMS NAUERT: That is a big question. You’re asking me about the entire history of the United States – should we apologize? That’s the question?\n\nQUESTION: Well, let’s start with the Iraq War.\n\nMS NAUERT: Should we apologize for our government all around the world?\n\nQUESTION: No, no.\n\nMS NAUERT: I think that the United States Government does far more good --\n\nQUESTION: Are you asking me to clarify?\n\nMS NAUERT: -- than we ever do bad. And certain people in the United States and in other countries have a look or have the perspective that America does more harm than good. I’m the kind of American that looks at it from the other way around. We do far more good.\n\nQUESTION: Most Americans are opposed to the Iraq War. Should the U.S. Government apologize for things that were put out by that podium, people who are in this administration who fabricated information to start the Iraq War?\n\nMS NAUERT: Look --\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nMS NAUERT: -- I get what you’re getting at. You want to be snarky and take a look back.\n\nQUESTION: No, I don’t want to be snarky. I want to get real.\n\nMS NAUERT: No, hold on, and take a look – okay, and take a look back --\n\nQUESTION: I want to get real.\n\nMS NAUERT: -- at the past 15 years. And Iraq is certainly a country that has been through a lot.\n\nQUESTION: Yes.\n\nMS NAUERT: I’ve been to Iraq; many of you have been to Iraq in covering what has taken place there, okay.\n\nQUESTION: I’m being anything but snarky.\n\nMS NAUERT: Let me finish, okay. They’ve faced a lot of challenges. Right now the most significant challenge there is ISIS, and the United States remains there at the invitation of the Iraqi Government to fight and take on ISIS. I want to commend the Iraqi Government for something – that is, for the past 15 years, that they have had a history of free and fair elections over 15 years. That is remarkable given where they were under the regime of Saddam Hussein. I recall having met Iraqis at that time – and this dates back to 2004, 2005 – and certainly everyone that I had talked to, an Iraqi citizen had had a family member that was killed in some sort of horrific fashion or disappeared and was never heard from again. I mean, that is something that as an American, when you start talking to citizens, and that is their experience, that is something that’s very difficult for the average American to understand, because that is simply the way of life there.\n\nThe United States has a strong relationship with the Government of Iraq. I’m going to look forward from this podium in this room. We have a good relationship with the Government of Iraq; I’m not going to look back at this point, okay?\n\nQUESTION: (Off-mike.)\n\nQUESTION: So no responsibility for --\n\nMS NAUERT: Go right ahead.\n\nQUESTION: -- the bloodshed of --\n\nMS NAUERT: Go right ahead.\n\nQUESTION: A follow-up question --\n\nQUESTION: -- or anything else?\n\nQUESTION: A follow-up question on Turkey?\n\nQUESTION: You get lots of questions. You get lots of questions.\n\nQUESTION: And that is that the Turks, in addition to the question of Manbij, they have also said that talks are about to resume very shortly. Is that true? Do you have a date for talks?\n\nMS NAUERT: We do not have anything to announce at this time.\n\nQUESTION: Do you – does the administration have a public view on this vote, that’s supposed to happen later today on the Hill, about Yemen?\n\nMS NAUERT: So I’m certainly aware of that vote taking place. As it pertains to Saudi Arabia, we typically don’t comment on pending legislation or voting action taking place in Congress. But after the fact, if we have something for you on that, I’ll let you know.\n\nQUESTION: Well, that’s not true. You take positions on – statement – there’s statements of administration policy on proposed legislation on almost every single bill.\n\nMS NAUERT: That’s not true, Matt.\n\nQUESTION: Yeah, it is.\n\nMS NAUERT: Because I punt to Congress quite often – (laughter) – when it comes to those types of things. So I would just refer you back to Congress. Okay?\n\nAll right. Thanks, everybody. We’ve got to go.\n\n(The briefing was concluded at 3:31 p.m.)\n\n# # #",

    "article_text": "Part one of a two part investigation into Cambridge Analytica/SCL’s global operations\n\nBy Max Blumenthal\n\nInternal documents exclusively obtained by the Grayzone Project and embedded at the end of this article show how Cambridge Analytica’s UK-based parent company, SCL group, conducted a surveillance operation in Yemen, using psychological profiling, “strategic communications campaigns,” and infiltration of foreign operatives into indigenous communities through unwitting local partners whom they were instructed to deceive.\n\nThe SCL documents describe “a research and analysis study undertaken by Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) on behalf of Archimedes,” a US-based military contractor. The name of the operation was “Project Titania.” It relied heavily on deception to gain access to the local population, ordering project operatives to develop a “cover story” that placed their presence in the country in a more innocent light.\n\nThe geographic targets of the project were Yemen’s Hadramout and Marib provinces. These regions have served as organizational bases for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and were at the time in the crosshairs of then-President Barack Obama’s drone assassination program.\n\nMany of the methods of surveillance and manipulation revealed in these SCL documents closely mirror the tactics that were later applied in Western electoral contests. And when these tactics were exposed in early 2018, they ignited a political firestorm.\n\nThe data and behavioral analytics firm Cambridge Analytica closed shop this May following damaging revelations that it obtained the raw data of over 80 million Facebook users during the 2016 presidential election campaign, and exploited this information to influence the outcome of numerous political campaigns. The damage spread across the Atlantic, to Cambridge Analytica’s UK-based parent company, SCL group, forcing it to shutter its operations as well.\n\nCambridge Analytica was partially owned by Steve Bannon, the former manager of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and ex-White House chief of staff. It was co-owned by Bannon’s main financial angel at the time, reclusive right-wing tech billionaire Robert Mercer, and his daughter, Rebekah Mercer, who served as its vice president.\n\nCambridge Analytica debuted its work with a series of Republican Get Out the Vote efforts in 2014, deploying the psychological profiling techniques that have become the company’s bread and butter. “Its dirty little secret was that there was no one American involved in [the 2016 effort], that it was a de facto foreign agent, working on an American election,” former Cambridge Analytica research director Christopher Wylie revealed.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Cambridge Analytica played a central role in Trump’s digital outreach efforts. In a hidden camera investigation by the UK’s Channel 4, Cambridge Analytica executives took credit for generating several enduring lines of attack against Hillary Clinton. “We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape,” one executive boasted. “And so this stuff infiltrates the online community, but with no branding, so it’s unattributable, untrackable.”\n\nSCL Group and ‘ Project Titania ‘\n\nThe ethically dubious tactics that Cambridge Analytica rolled out during the 2016 campaign had been honed by its parent company, the London-based SCL Group, in an array of influence operations in conflict zones and Third World election contests.\n\nFounded in 2005, SCL specializes in what company literature has described as “influence operations” and “psychological warfare” around the globe. An SCL brochure leaked to the BBC revealed how the firm exacerbated ethnic tensions in Latvia to assist their client in 2006.\n\nA year later, the firm orchestrated “anti-election” rallies to suppress the opposition vote in Nigeria’s 2007 presidential election. Then, in 2010, according to the BBC, SCL initiated an “ambitious campaign of political graffiti” that “ostensibly came from the youth,” enabling its client to “claim credit for listening to a ‘united youth.'”\n\nSCL has also applied its influence in Ukraine, first as part of the broader public relations campaign during the country’s NATO-backed 2004 “Orange Revolution,” then in Ukraine’s contested Donbas region, where it boasted in company literature that it “succeeded in maintaining the cohesion of the coalition to ensure a hard fought victory.”\n\nBut SCL has also played an equally unsettling role as a private arm of British and US counter-insurgency efforts in the Middle East.\n\nInternal documents legally obtained by the Grayzone Project provide an exclusive look at one such effort overseen by SCL. The materials show how the company used psychological profiling, “strategic communications campaigns,” and foreign operatives, in methods of surveillance and manipulation that parallel the tactics that were subsequently used to influence Western elections.\n\nA media professional whom SCL attempted to recruit for an influence operation in Iran described to the Grayzone Project an array of covert campaigns across the region. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the source said they were solicited in 2009 by a SCL staffer seeking a person to infiltrate Iran under journalistic cover and gather data on its population.\n\nThough the media professional rejected the job, expressing deep reservations about the company’s emphasis on subterfuge, they described similar operations they learned about that targeted populations in Libya, Pakistan, and Syria.\n\nThe source was told that the Syrian operation gathered human intelligence by using foreigners either posing as Arabic language students or enrolled in study abroad-style programs.\n\nSCL has acknowledged in company documents that it has operated in Libya, Syria and Iran.\n\nThe documents obtained by the Grayzone Project provide perhaps the first inside look at one of these programs. They shine light on the “research and analysis study” that SCL conducted in Yemen on behalf of the military contractor Archimedes, known as Project Titania.\n\n‘A Cover Story Will Be Used’\n\nWhen SCL launched Project Titania, US drones regularly shadowed the skies over the Yemeni regions of Marib and Hadramout. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had successfully turned both areas into training and recruitment grounds, as well as bases for attacks on government troops.\n\nIn May 2010, an American drone strike accidentally killed the deputy governor of Marib, provoking his tribe to attack the country’s main oil pipeline in revenge and drain its economy of $1 billion in revenue. A year later in Marib, a drone strike personally authorized by then-President Barack Obama killed AQAP propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki and his son, Abdurahman, who was a US citizen.\n\nProject Titania was defined by its authors as a counter-radicalization study aimed at reducing the appeal and influence of AQAP across Yemen. The operation first aimed to identify a “Non Desired Behavior” — defined as “support for, and engagement in, violent Jihadism” — and to explain the factors that accounted for its existence and growth. Next, the project called for a proposal for a “Strategic Communication Campaign” to undermine the spread of jihadist ideology.\n\nSCL instructed its field researchers to disseminate questionnaires to Yemeni locals in order to gather their psychological profiles. The goal spelled out in Project Titania’s mission plan was to gain a “detailed psychosocial understanding of the groups that can be used to most effectively influence” young Yemeni men deemed vulnerable to jihadist recruitment. These methods predated the use by Cambridge Analytica of Facebook questionnaires to gather personal data on American voters.\n\nThe foreigners dispatched to implement Project Titania were explicitly instructed to deceive the Yemeni citizens they would rely on for field research. “A cover story will be used to explain the purpose of the research to the researchers; the local researchers will not be informed of the objectives or sponsors of the study,” a SCL document states. “The questionnaire and interview protocol will be completely non-attributable to the original source.”\n\nSCL even proposed options for the cover story: “Prior to completing the interview or the questionnaire, all participants will be given a rationale for the study (i.e., that the study is part of a university research programme or a market research programme) and they will be informed that their responses will be kept confidential.”\n\nThe use of cover stories in Western intelligence operations has led to severe social damage in some cases. In Pakistan, locals had long suspected that the CIA was hunting for drone targets behind the smokescreen of a vaccination program run by Pakistani Polio Eradication Initiative. When news broke that the CIA had run a bogus hepatitis B eradication campaign in an unsuccessful bid to obtain the DNA of Osama bin Laden’s family, militant elements initiated a boycott of vaccination programs. Over 3 million children went without polio vaccines as a result, and the disease spread into neighboring countries.\n\nDid the UK Government Contract SCL in Yemen?\n\nThe leaked Project Titania documents highlight the British government’s participation in SCL’s covert activities in Yemen, and suggest that it was the client that had contracted the private counter-insurgency operation.\n\nA section labeled “risk register” contains the following security guideline for field operatives: “All foreign national team members to liaise with contact at British embassy and register with UK FCO LOCATE service.” (The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s LOCATE service provided expats with security issue updates; it was abolished in 2013 because so few citizens enrolled in it).\n\nProject Titania documents listed an array of NGOs operating in Marib and appeared to suggest them as potential vehicles for obtaining intelligence on the indigenous population. The names of those NGOs have been redacted from this report to protect staff from repercussions that might result from their connection to a covert Western influence operation. If any wound up as participants in Project Titania, they did so unwittingly, as project materials specifically demanded they be coerced into the operation under false pretenses.\n\nYasha Levine, a journalist and author of “Surveillance Valley: The Hidden History of the Internet,” saw SCL’s Project Titania as a fairly typical counter-insurgency operation. “Looking at these documents about SCL’s Yemen data-driven counterinsurgency program, the most remarkable thing about them is just how unremarkable it is,” Levine told the Grayzone Project.\n\n“If you change the wording a bit,” he continued, “SCL’s proposal could have been written a half century ago for the Vietnam War, where computer-aided counterinsurgency technologies were first pioneered. Back then the idea was that to fight insurgencies — wars in which enemy combatants came out of the general population — you first needed to understand the cultural, social and political environment in which the enemy operated. That meant first and foremost studying and surveilling restive populations as if they were lab rats, and then using advanced computer technology to shift through and process all the information coming in.”\n\n“Even back then, in the 1960s, the holy grail was to build computer technologies that could watch the world in real time and predict human behavior — stopping revolts and revolutions before they had a chance to develop,” Levine said. “The push to build these technologies is what the Internet came out of.”\n\nBut there was more to Project Titania than what was revealed in the SCL documents. Communications obtained by the Grayzone Project linked the project’s principal director to a much wider program of surveillance and data mining aimed not only at a region or two, but at the entire Arab world.\n\nStay tuned for part two of this investigation. The complete plan for Project Titania is below.\n\nSCL/Cambridge Analytica Project Titania Yemen Plan by Max Blumenthal on Scribd\n\nSCL/Cambridge Analytica Project Titania Plan for Yemen, Part Two by Max Blumenthal on Scribd",

    "article_text": "Part Two of an Exclusive Two Part Investigation\n\nBy Max Blumenthal\n\nRead part one here.\n\nInternal documents exclusively obtained by the Grayzone Project (and embedded after this article) show how Cambridge Analytica’s UK-based parent company, SCL group, conducted a surveillance operation in Yemen called Project Titania. The initiative relied on psychological profiling, “strategic communications campaigns,” and infiltration of foreign operatives into indigenous communities through unwitting local partners whom they were instructed to deceive.\n\nAccording to the materials detailed here, Project Titania was to be implemented by SCL “on behalf of Archimedes.” Archimedes is a US-based private contractor that advertises its ability to provide “Systems Integration, Engineering, and Mission Support solutions to government and businesses worldwide.”\n\nThe partnership between SCL and Archimedes highlights the seamless web of relationships between private intelligence firms and Western governments engaged in counter-intelligence activities in the Middle East. These large scale surveillance operations have been conducted without the knowledge of the Western public or input from elected officials, and would have remained mostly unknown had a series of leaks and hacking operations not placed them in the public domain.\n\nCommunications obtained legally by the Grayzone Project indicated that a former Archimedes staffer named Tim Riesen was a key contact for the Yemen operation. Little information is publicly available about Riesen; he is currently the the CEO of an international corporate consultancy firm called Madison Springfield, Inc.\n\nWhile he is also listed as an adjunct political science professor at the school of graduate studies at Norwich University, a private military academy in Vermont, published material by Riesen is difficult to find online. Riesen did not respond to an interview request delivered by the Grayzone Project to his email at Madison Springfield.\n\nOne of Riesen’s few public appearances consists of a brief cameo in a 2011 video by AFRICOM, the US military command center that operates in 53 African countries. In the video, an AFRICOM staffer describes a briefing Riesen delivered on the demographics and political tendencies of South Sudan ahead of its independence referendum that year.\n\nDespite his negligible online footprint, or perhaps because of it, Riesen has made himself a considerable player in the world of private intelligence. That is clear from the tranche of emails that surfaced when the private intel firm HBGary was hacked in 2010 by the Anonymous collective.\n\nThe HBGary hacks were first reported by journalist Barrett Brown, who was prosecuted by Obama’s Department of Justice and sentenced to five years in prison for publicizing the emails. When their contents were published in full at Wikileaks, HBGary and consortium of intelligence firms were exposed for planning to carry out a full-scale attack on American social justice activists and journalists.\n\nThe firms homed in on journalist Glenn Greenwald and Wikileaks, plotting to undermine both through a campaign of “disinformation,” spawning internal rifts and “creating messages around actions to sabotage or discredit the opposing organization.” HBGary was also considered by the US Chamber of Commerce to launch a smear campaign against its critics.\n\nIn a separate initiative, HBGary aimed to develop a “persona management” system for the US Air Force that enabled users to spam social media with replies from users with false but detailed personas that gave the impression of organic consensus. The project outlined in the emails closely resembles the kind of troll and bot farms that have gained infamy amid America’s furor over Russian meddling, however, this one was made in the USA.\n\nAccording to Barrett Brown, the contract for the system was ultimately won by a subsidiary of Cubic, a major multi-national arms, combat training company, and infrastructure company.\n\nArchimedes and the ROMAS/COIN mass surveillance plan\n\nThough the HBGary emails generated a brief flurry of media interest, little attention was devoted to one of the most disturbing programs they exposed. In a series of communications between intelligence firm directors, an operation came to light that Brown described as “a secretive and immensely sophisticated campaign of mass surveillance and data mining against the Arab world, allowing the intelligence community to monitor the habits, conversations, and activity of millions of individuals at once.”\n\nThat plan was Romas/COIN, with “COIN” referring to counter-intelligence — the same acronym used in the FBI’s notorious COINTELPRO program. Riesen’s Archimedes was a key player in the development of the initiative.\n\nAccording to details of the program gathered by Brown and a collection of online researchers, Apple was also an active team partner, communicating regularly with HBGary CEO Aaron Barr and his peers. In one email, Apple’s “Homeland Defense Manager” Andy Kemp rescheduled a meeting with Barr by explaining, “I’ve been requested to be [in] phoenix by a senior member at ODNI [the Office of the Director of National Intelligence] – someone That I don’t say no to.”\n\nRomas/COIN focused heavily on mobile phone software and applications. Its designers aimed to develop specialized “social media monitoring tools” and linguistic analysis systems, presumably to surveil the communications of younger, activist-minded Arabs on platforms like Facebook.\n\nTo emphasize the Arab-centric nature of Romas/COIN, Chris Clair of the intelligence firm TASC proposed a bold name to his colleagues: “Can we name COIN Saif? Saif is the sword an Arab executioner uses when they decapitate criminals. I can think of a few cool brands for this.”\n\nIn the end, the private spies agreed to call their program “ROMAS.”\n\n“ROMAS is the name of a middle eastern spider. 😉 I thought I was pretty clever,” HBGary’s Barr wrote. “I am glad they are going to continue to use the name.”\n\nRiesen appears in several emails with Clair, Barr, and a handful of partners pursuing what he called a “potential collaboration opportunity.” He described his company, Archimedes, and Barr’s HBGary, as subcontractors to Clair’s TASC on the project.\n\nTogether, they brainstormed a plan to compete with the contractor Northrup Grumman for a lucrative contract from an unnamed US government client seeking advanced capabilities in surveillance and “IO” — the acronym for influence operations.\n\nOn July 23, 2010, the ROMAS/COIN team decided on an informal setting to brainstorm their proposal. “And we are on Thursday,” Clair informed Riesen. I’ll have the steaks ready to grill and the beer will be chilled. I am sure it will be loads of fun.”\n\nMassive State Department contracts to SCL for covert propaganda\n\nIn a recent exchange at the US State Department, spokesperson Heather Nauert confirmed that the US government had provided SCL with lucrative contracts to advance its propaganda goals on the international stage. Nauert acknowledged that in late 2016, the US State Department’s Global Engagement Center was granted a $120 million budget to wage war on online ISIS recruitment and Russian “disinformation.”\n\nThe counter-propaganda initiative promptly doled out two contracts, totaling $496,232, to SCL in February and March of 2017 to carry out “target audience research.” According to Nauert, the contracts to SCL were aimed at supplementing US anti-ISIS operations in the Middle East.\n\nThe Global Engagement Center is an international influence operation run out of heart of the State Department. Originally formed as the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, and with a mission initially focused on fighting ISIS-oriented propaganda, the operation shifted its focus — and massively expanded its budget — as soon as the national panic over Russian meddling erupted during the 2016 election.\n\nAccording to Richard Stengel, the center’s former director, “we supported credible counter-Russian voices in the region. We pretty much stopped creating content ourselves.” Which voices Stengel was referring to remains unclear, but as the former managing editor of Time Magazine, his remarks raised questions about whether the US government was covertly paying or promoting journalists to advance its agenda in Eastern Europe.\n\nAt a Council on Foreign Relations forum on “fake news” this May, Stengel made an unusually candid disclosure. “My old job at the State Department was what people used to jokingly [call] the chief propagandist job,” he declared. “I’m not against propaganda, every country does it and they have to do it to their own population and I don’t necessarily think it’s that awful.”\n\nAt a Council on Foreign Relations forum about \"fake news,\" former Editor at Time Magazine Richard Stengel directly states that he supports the use of propaganda on American citizens – then shuts the session down when challenged about how propaganda is used against the third world pic.twitter.com/ClAT5POv7G — William Craddick (@williamcraddick) May 11, 2018\n\nRebranding a toxic name\n\nJust weeks after the collapse of Cambridge Analytica and SCL, the firm’s principals, including Rebekah Mercer, magically resurfaced as directors of a newly minted, London-based company called Emerdata that appears to differ from SCL in name only. In fact, the firm is even headquartered at the same office formerly occupied by SCL Elections.\n\nThe brazen rebranding of SCL/Cambridge Analytica might be disturbing, but these firms are only part of a much wider web of private intelligence firms determined to manipulate the behavior of the public for the benefit of powerful clients. And before these cynical operators applied their methods in Western elections, they tested them on populations in conflict zones like Yemen.\n\nBack in 2011, when he exposed the Romas/COIN mass surveillance program, Barrett Brown warned of the coming blowback for the West. “It is inevitable, then, that such capabilities as form the backbone of Romas/COIN…will be deployed against a growing segment of the world’s population,” Brown wrote. “The powerful institutions that wield them will grow all the more powerful as they are provided better and better methods by which to monitor, deceive, and manipulate. The informed electorate upon which liberty depends will be increasingly misinformed. No tactical advantage conferred by the use of these programs can outweigh the damage that will be done to mankind in the process of creating them.”\n\nSCL/Cambridge Analytica Project Titania Plan for Yemen, Part Two by Max Blumenthal on Scribd\n\nSCL/Cambridge Analytica Project Titania Yemen Plan by Max Blumenthal on Scribd",

    "article_text": "The first time I met Christopher Wylie, he didn’t yet have pink hair. That comes later. As does his mission to rewind time. To put the genie back in the bottle.\n\nBy the time I met him in person, I’d already been talking to him on a daily basis for hours at a time. On the phone, he was clever, funny, bitchy, profound, intellectually ravenous, compelling. A master storyteller. A politicker. A data science nerd.\n\nPlay Video 13:04 Cambridge Analytica whistleblower: 'We spent $1m harvesting millions of Facebook profiles' – video\n\nTwo months later, when he arrived in London from Canada, he was all those things in the flesh. And yet the flesh was impossibly young. He was 27 then (he’s 28 now), a fact that has always seemed glaringly at odds with what he has done. He may have played a pivotal role in the momentous political upheavals of 2016. At the very least, he played a consequential role. At 24, he came up with an idea that led to the foundation of a company called Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that went on to claim a major role in the Leave campaign for Britain’s EU membership referendum, and later became a key figure in digital operations during Donald Trump’s election campaign.\n\nOr, as Wylie describes it, he was the gay Canadian vegan who somehow ended up creating “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare mindfuck tool”.\n\nIn 2014, Steve Bannon – then executive chairman of the “alt-right” news network Breitbart – was Wylie’s boss. And Robert Mercer, the secretive US hedge-fund billionaire and Republican donor, was Cambridge Analytica’s investor. And the idea they bought into was to bring big data and social media to an established military methodology – “information operations” – then turn it on the US electorate.\n\nIt was Wylie who came up with that idea and oversaw its realisation. And it was Wylie who, last spring, became my source. In May 2017, I wrote an article headlined “The great British Brexit robbery”, which set out a skein of threads that linked Brexit to Trump to Russia. Wylie was one of a handful of individuals who provided the evidence behind it. I found him, via another Cambridge Analytica ex-employee, lying low in Canada: guilty, brooding, indignant, confused. “I haven’t talked about this to anyone,” he said at the time. And then he couldn’t stop talking.\n\nBy that time, Steve Bannon had become Trump’s chief strategist. Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, had won contracts with the US State Department and was pitching to the Pentagon, and Wylie was genuinely freaked out. “It’s insane,” he told me one night. “The company has created psychological profiles of 230 million Americans. And now they want to work with the Pentagon? It’s like Nixon on steroids.”\n\nHe ended up showing me a tranche of documents that laid out the secret workings behind Cambridge Analytica. And in the months following publication of my article in May, it was revealed that the company had “reached out” to WikiLeaks to help distribute Hillary Clinton’s stolen emails in 2016. And then we watched as it became a subject of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible Russian collusion in the US election.\n\nThe Observer also received the first of three letters from Cambridge Analytica threatening to sue Guardian News and Media for defamation. We are still only just starting to understand the maelstrom of forces that came together to create the conditions for what Mueller confirmed last month was “information warfare”. But Wylie offers a unique, worm’s-eye view of the events of 2016. Of how Facebook was hijacked, repurposed to become a theatre of war: how it became a launchpad for what seems to be an extraordinary attack on the US’s democratic process.\n\nWylie oversaw what may have been the first critical breach. Aged 24, while studying for a PhD in fashion trend forecasting, he came up with a plan to harvest the Facebook profiles of millions of people in the US, and to use their private and personal information to create sophisticated psychological and political profiles. And then target them with political ads designed to work on their particular psychological makeup.\n\n“We ‘broke’ Facebook,” he says.\n\nAnd he did it on behalf of his new boss, Steve Bannon.\n\n“Is it fair to say you ‘hacked’ Facebook?” I ask him one night.\n\nHe hesitates. “I’ll point out that I assumed it was entirely legal and above board.”\n\nLast month, Facebook’s UK director of policy, Simon Milner, told British MPs on a select committee inquiry into fake news, chaired by Conservative MP Damian Collins, that Cambridge Analytica did not have Facebook data. The official Hansard extract reads:\n\nChristian Matheson (MP for Chester): “Have you ever passed any user information over to Cambridge Analytica or any of its associated companies?”\n\nSimon Milner: “No.”\n\nMatheson: “But they do hold a large chunk of Facebook’s user data, don’t they?”\n\nMilner: “No. They may have lots of data, but it will not be Facebook user data. It may be data about people who are on Facebook that they have gathered themselves, but it is not data that we have provided.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica CEO. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nTwo weeks later, on 27 February, as part of the same parliamentary inquiry, Rebecca Pow, MP for Taunton Deane, asked Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix: “Does any of the data come from Facebook?” Nix replied: “We do not work with Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data.”\n\nAnd through it all, Wylie and I, plus a handful of editors and a small, international group of academics and researchers, have known that – at least in 2014 – that certainly wasn’t the case, because Wylie has the paper trail. In our first phone call, he told me he had the receipts, invoices, emails, legal letters – records that showed how, between June and August 2014, the profiles of more than 50 million Facebook users had been harvested. Most damning of all, he had a letter from Facebook’s own lawyers admitting that Cambridge Analytica had acquired the data illegitimately.\n\nGoing public involves an enormous amount of risk. Wylie is breaking a non-disclosure agreement and risks being sued. He is breaking the confidence of Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer.\n\nIt’s taken a rollercoaster of a year to help get Wylie to a place where it’s possible for him to finally come forward. A year in which Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of investigations on both sides of the Atlantic – Robert Mueller’s in the US, and separate inquiries by the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner’s Office in the UK, both triggered in February 2017, after the Observer’s first article in this investigation.\n\nIt has been a year, too, in which Wylie has been trying his best to rewind – to undo events that he set in motion. Earlier this month, he submitted a dossier of evidence to the Information Commissioner’s Office and the National Crime Agency’s cybercrime unit. He is now in a position to go on the record: the data nerd who came in from the cold.\n\nThere are many points where this story could begin. One is in 2012, when Wylie was 21 and working for the Liberal Democrats in the UK, then in government as junior coalition partners. His career trajectory has been, like most aspects of his life so far, extraordinary, preposterous, implausible.\n\nProfile Cambridge Analytica: the key players Show Hide Alexander Nix, CEO An Old Etonian with a degree from Manchester University, Nix, 42, worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on 260 campaigns globally. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from Robert Mercer. Aleksandr Kogan, data miner Aleksandr Kogan was born in Moldova and lived in Moscow until the age of seven, then moved with his family to the US, where he became a naturalised citizen. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, and got his PhD at the University of Hong Kong before joining Cambridge as a lecturer in psychology and expert in social media psychometrics. He set up Global Science Research (GSR) to carry out CA’s data research. While at Cambridge he accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research. He changed his name to Spectre when he married, but later reverted to Kogan. Steve Bannon, former board member A former investment banker turned “alt-right” media svengali, Steve Bannon was boss at website Breitbart when he met Christopher Wylie and Nix and advised Robert Mercer to invest in political data research by setting up CA. In August 2016 he became Donald Trump’s campaign CEO. Bannon encouraged the reality TV star to embrace the “populist, economic nationalist” agenda that would carry him into the White House. That earned Bannon the post of chief strategist to the president and for a while he was arguably the second most powerful man in America. By August 2017 his relationship with Trump had soured and he was out.\n\nRobert Mercer, investor Robert Mercer, 71, is a computer scientist and hedge fund billionaire, who used his fortune to become one of the most influential men in US politics as a top Republican donor. An AI expert, he made a fortune with quantitative trading pioneers Renaissance Technologies, then built a $60m war chest to back conservative causes by using an offshore investment vehicle to avoid US tax.\n\nRebekah Mercer, investor Rebekah Mercer has a maths degree from Stanford, and worked as a trader, but her influence comes primarily from her father’s billions. The fortysomething, the second of Mercer’s three daughters, heads up the family foundation which channels money to rightwing groups. The conservative mega‑donors backed Breitbart, Bannon and, most influentially, poured millions into Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nWylie grew up in British Columbia and as a teenager he was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. He left school at 16 without a single qualification. Yet at 17, he was working in the office of the leader of the Canadian opposition; at 18, he went to learn all things data from Obama’s national director of targeting, which he then introduced to Canada for the Liberal party. At 19, he taught himself to code, and in 2010, age 20, he came to London to study law at the London School of Economics.\n\n“Politics is like the mob, though,” he says. “You never really leave. I got a call from the Lib Dems. They wanted to upgrade their databases and voter targeting. So, I combined working for them with studying for my degree.”\n\nPolitics is also where he feels most comfortable. He hated school, but as an intern in the Canadian parliament he discovered a world where he could talk to adults and they would listen. He was the kid who did the internet stuff and within a year he was working for the leader of the opposition.\n\nIt showed these odd patterns. People who liked 'I hate Israel' on Facebook also tended to like KitKats\n\n“He’s one of the brightest people you will ever meet,” a senior politician who’s known Wylie since he was 20 told me. “Sometimes that’s a blessing and sometimes a curse.”\n\nMeanwhile, at Cambridge University’s Psychometrics Centre, two psychologists, Michal Kosinski and David Stillwell, were experimenting with a way of studying personality – by quantifying it.\n\nStarting in 2007, Stillwell, while a student, had devised various apps for Facebook, one of which, a personality quiz called myPersonality, had gone viral. Users were scored on “big five” personality traits – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism – and in exchange, 40% of them consented to give him access to their Facebook profiles. Suddenly, there was a way of measuring personality traits across the population and correlating scores against Facebook “likes” across millions of people.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Examples, above and below, of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test. Respondents were asked: How important should this message be to all Americans?\n\nThe research was original, groundbreaking and had obvious possibilities. “They had a lot of approaches from the security services,” a member of the centre told me. “There was one called You Are What You Like and it was demonstrated to the intelligence services. And it showed these odd patterns; that, for example, people who liked ‘I hate Israel’ on Facebook also tended to like Nike shoes and KitKats.\n\n“There are agencies that fund research on behalf of the intelligence services. And they were all over this research. That one was nicknamed Operation KitKat.”\n\nThe defence and military establishment were the first to see the potential of the research. Boeing, a major US defence contractor, funded Kosinski’s PhD and Darpa, the US government’s secretive Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is cited in at least two academic papers supporting Kosinski’s work.\n\nBut when, in 2013, the first major paper was published, others saw this potential too, including Wylie. He had finished his degree and had started his PhD in fashion forecasting, and was thinking about the Lib Dems. It is fair to say that he didn’t have a clue what he was walking into.\n\n“I wanted to know why the Lib Dems sucked at winning elections when they used to run the country up to the end of the 19th century,” Wylie explains. “And I began looking at consumer and demographic data to see what united Lib Dem voters, because apart from bits of Wales and the Shetlands it’s weird, disparate regions. And what I found is there were no strong correlations. There was no signal in the data.\n\n“And then I came across a paper about how personality traits could be a precursor to political behaviour, and it suddenly made sense. Liberalism is correlated with high openness and low conscientiousness, and when you think of Lib Dems they’re absent-minded professors and hippies. They’re the early adopters… they’re highly open to new ideas. And it just clicked all of a sudden.”\n\nHere was a way for the party to identify potential new voters. The only problem was that the Lib Dems weren’t interested.\n\n“I did this presentation at which I told them they would lose half their 57 seats, and they were like: ‘Why are you so pessimistic?’ They actually lost all but eight of their seats, FYI.”\n\nAnother Lib Dem connection introduced Wylie to a company called SCL Group, one of whose subsidiaries, SCL Elections, would go on to create Cambridge Analytica (an incorporated venture between SCL Elections and Robert Mercer, funded by the latter). For all intents and purposes, SCL/Cambridge Analytica are one and the same.\n\nAlexander Nix, then CEO of SCL Elections, made Wylie an offer he couldn’t resist. “He said: ‘We’ll give you total freedom. Experiment. Come and test out all your crazy ideas.’”\n\nAnother example of the visual messages trialled by GSR’s online profiling test.\n\nIn the history of bad ideas, this turned out to be one of the worst. The job was research director across the SCL group, a private contractor that has both defence and elections operations. Its defence arm was a contractor to the UK’s Ministry of Defence and the US’s Department of Defense, among others. Its expertise was in “psychological operations” – or psyops – changing people’s minds not through persuasion but through “informational dominance”, a set of techniques that includes rumour, disinformation and fake news.\n\nSCL Elections had used a similar suite of tools in more than 200 elections around the world, mostly in undeveloped democracies that Wylie would come to realise were unequipped to defend themselves.\n\nWylie holds a British Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa – a UK work visa given to just 200 people a year. He was working inside government (with the Lib Dems) as a political strategist with advanced data science skills. But no one, least of all him, could have predicted what came next. When he turned up at SCL’s offices in Mayfair, he had no clue that he was walking into the middle of a nexus of defence and intelligence projects, private contractors and cutting-edge cyberweaponry.\n\n“The thing I think about all the time is, what if I’d taken a job at Deloitte instead? They offered me one. I just think if I’d taken literally any other job, Cambridge Analytica wouldn’t exist. You have no idea how much I brood on this.”\n\nA few months later, in autumn 2013, Wylie met Steve Bannon. At the time, he was editor-in-chief of Breitbart, which he had brought to Britain to support his friend Nigel Farage in his mission to take Britain out of the European Union.\n\nWhat was he like?\n\n“Smart,” says Wylie. “Interesting. Really interested in ideas. He’s the only straight man I’ve ever talked to about intersectional feminist theory. He saw its relevance straightaway to the oppressions that conservative, young white men feel.”\n\nWylie meeting Bannon was the moment petrol was poured on a flickering flame. Wylie lives for ideas. He speaks 19 to the dozen for hours at a time. He had a theory to prove. And at the time, this was a purely intellectual problem. Politics was like fashion, he told Bannon.\n\nIf you do not respect the agency of people, anything you do after that point is not conducive to democracy Christopher Wylie\n\n“[Bannon] got it immediately. He believes in the whole Andrew Breitbart doctrine that politics is downstream from culture, so to change politics you need to change culture. And fashion trends are a useful proxy for that. Trump is like a pair of Uggs, or Crocs, basically. So how do you get from people thinking ‘Ugh. Totally ugly’ to the moment when everyone is wearing them? That was the inflection point he was looking for.”\n\nBut Wylie wasn’t just talking about fashion. He had recently been exposed to a new discipline: “information operations”, which ranks alongside land, sea, air and space in the US military’s doctrine of the “five-dimensional battle space”. His brief ranged across the SCL Group – the British government has paid SCL to conduct counter-extremism operations in the Middle East, and the US Department of Defense has contracted it to work in Afghanistan.\n\nI tell him that another former employee described the firm as “MI6 for hire”, and I’d never quite understood it.\n\n“It’s like dirty MI6 because you’re not constrained. There’s no having to go to a judge to apply for permission. It’s normal for a ‘market research company’ to amass data on domestic populations. And if you’re working in some country and there’s an auxiliary benefit to a current client with aligned interests, well that’s just a bonus.”\n\nWhen I ask how Bannon even found SCL, Wylie tells me what sounds like a tall tale, though it’s one he can back up with an email about how Mark Block, a veteran Republican strategist, happened to sit next to a cyberwarfare expert for the US air force on a plane. “And the cyberwarfare guy is like, ‘Oh, you should meet SCL. They do cyberwarfare for elections.’”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Bannon: ‘He loved the gays,’ says Wylie. ‘He saw us as early adopters.’ Photograph: Tony Gentile/Reuters\n\nIt was Bannon who took this idea to the Mercers: Robert Mercer – the co-CEO of the hedge fund Renaissance Technologies, who used his billions to pursue a rightwing agenda, donating to Republican causes and supporting Republican candidates – and his daughter Rebekah.\n\nNix and Wylie flew to New York to meet the Mercers in Rebekah’s Manhattan apartment.\n\n“She loved me. She was like, ‘Oh we need more of your type on our side!’”\n\nYour type?\n\n“The gays. She loved the gays. So did Steve [Bannon]. He saw us as early adopters. He figured, if you can get the gays on board, everyone else will follow. It’s why he was so into the whole Milo [Yiannopoulos] thing.”\n\nRobert Mercer was a pioneer in AI and machine translation. He helped invent algorithmic trading – which replaced hedge fund managers with computer programs – and he listened to Wylie’s pitch. It was for a new kind of political message-targeting based on an influential and groundbreaking 2014 paper researched at Cambridge’s Psychometrics Centre, called: “Computer-based personality judgments are more accurate than those made by humans”.\n\n“In politics, the money man is usually the dumbest person in the room. Whereas it’s the opposite way around with Mercer,” says Wylie. “He said very little, but he really listened. He wanted to understand the science. And he wanted proof that it worked.”\n\nAnd to do that, Wylie needed data.\n\nHow Cambridge Analytica acquired the data has been the subject of internal reviews at Cambridge University, of many news articles and much speculation and rumour.\n\nWhen Nix was interviewed by MPs last month, Damian Collins asked him:\n\n“Does any of your data come from Global Science Research company?”\n\nNix: “GSR?”\n\nCollins: “Yes.”\n\nNix: “We had a relationship with GSR. They did some research for us back in 2014. That research proved to be fruitless and so the answer is no.”\n\nCollins: “They have not supplied you with data or information?”\n\nNix: “No.”\n\nCollins: “Your datasets are not based on information you have received from them?”\n\nNix: “No.”\n\nCollins: “At all?”\n\nNix: “At all.”\n\nThe problem with Nix’s response to Collins is that Wylie has a copy of an executed contract, dated 4 June 2014, which confirms that SCL, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, entered into a commercial arrangement with a company called Global Science Research (GSR), owned by Cambridge-based academic Aleksandr Kogan, specifically premised on the harvesting and processing of Facebook data, so that it could be matched to personality traits and voter rolls.\n\nHe has receipts showing that Cambridge Analytica spent $7m to amass this data, about $1m of it with GSR. He has the bank records and wire transfers. Emails reveal Wylie first negotiated with Michal Kosinski, one of the co-authors of the original myPersonality research paper, to use the myPersonality database. But when negotiations broke down, another psychologist, Aleksandr Kogan, offered a solution that many of his colleagues considered unethical. He offered to replicate Kosinski and Stillwell’s research and cut them out of the deal. For Wylie it seemed a perfect solution. “Kosinski was asking for $500,000 for the IP but Kogan said he could replicate it and just harvest his own set of data.” (Kosinski says the fee was to fund further research.)\n\nAn unethical solution? Dr Aleksandr Kogan Photograph: alex kogan\n\nKogan then set up GSR to do the work, and proposed to Wylie they use the data to set up an interdisciplinary institute working across the social sciences. “What happened to that idea,” I ask Wylie. “It never happened. I don’t know why. That’s one of the things that upsets me the most.”\n\nIt was Bannon’s interest in culture as war that ignited Wylie’s intellectual concept. But it was Robert Mercer’s millions that created a firestorm. Kogan was able to throw money at the hard problem of acquiring personal data: he advertised for people who were willing to be paid to take a personality quiz on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and Qualtrics. At the end of which Kogan’s app, called thisismydigitallife, gave him permission to access their Facebook profiles. And not just theirs, but their friends’ too. On average, each “seeder” – the people who had taken the personality test, around 320,000 in total – unwittingly gave access to at least 160 other people’s profiles, none of whom would have known or had reason to suspect.\n\nWhat the email correspondence between Cambridge Analytica employees and Kogan shows is that Kogan had collected millions of profiles in a matter of weeks. But neither Wylie nor anyone else at Cambridge Analytica had checked that it was legal. It certainly wasn’t authorised. Kogan did have permission to pull Facebook data, but for academic purposes only. What’s more, under British data protection laws, it’s illegal for personal data to be sold to a third party without consent.\n\n“Facebook could see it was happening,” says Wylie. “Their security protocols were triggered because Kogan’s apps were pulling this enormous amount of data, but apparently Kogan told them it was for academic use. So they were like, ‘Fine’.”\n\nKogan maintains that everything he did was legal and he had a “close working relationship” with Facebook, which had granted him permission for his apps.\n\nCambridge Analytica had its data. This was the foundation of everything it did next – how it extracted psychological insights from the “seeders” and then built an algorithm to profile millions more.\n\nFor more than a year, the reporting around what Cambridge Analytica did or didn’t do for Trump has revolved around the question of “psychographics”, but Wylie points out: “Everything was built on the back of that data. The models, the algorithm. Everything. Why wouldn’t you use it in your biggest campaign ever?”\n\nIn December 2015, the Guardian’s Harry Davies published the first report about Cambridge Analytica acquiring Facebook data and using it to support Ted Cruz in his campaign to be the US Republican candidate. But it wasn’t until many months later that Facebook took action. And then, all they did was write a letter. In August 2016, shortly before the US election, and two years after the breach took place, Facebook’s lawyers wrote to Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014, and told him the data had been illicitly obtained and that “GSR was not authorised to share or sell it”. They said it must be deleted immediately.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Christopher Wylie: ‘It’s like Nixon on steroids’\n\n“I already had. But literally all I had to do was tick a box and sign it and send it back, and that was it,” says Wylie. “Facebook made zero effort to get the data back.”\n\nThere were multiple copies of it. It had been emailed in unencrypted files.\n\nCambridge Analytica rejected all allegations the Observer put to them.\n\nDr Kogan – who later changed his name to Dr Spectre, but has subsequently changed it back to Dr Kogan – is still a faculty member at Cambridge University, a senior research associate. But what his fellow academics didn’t know until Kogan revealed it in emails to the Observer (although Cambridge University says that Kogan told the head of the psychology department), is that he is also an associate professor at St Petersburg University. Further research revealed that he’s received grants from the Russian government to research “Stress, health and psychological wellbeing in social networks”. The opportunity came about on a trip to the city to visit friends and family, he said.\n\nThere are other dramatic documents in Wylie’s stash, including a pitch made by Cambridge Analytica to Lukoil, Russia’s second biggest oil producer. In an email dated 17 July 2014, about the US presidential primaries, Nix wrote to Wylie: “We have been asked to write a memo to Lukoil (the Russian oil and gas company) to explain to them how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business. Nix said that “they understand behavioural microtargeting in the context of elections” but that they were “failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers”. The work, he said, would be “shared with the CEO of the business”, a former Soviet oil minister and associate of Putin, Vagit Alekperov.\n\n“It didn’t make any sense to me,” says Wylie. “I didn’t understand either the email or the pitch presentation we did. Why would a Russian oil company want to target information on American voters?”\n\nMueller’s investigation traces the first stages of the Russian operation to disrupt the 2016 US election back to 2014, when the Russian state made what appears to be its first concerted efforts to harness the power of America’s social media platforms, including Facebook. And it was in late summer of the same year that Cambridge Analytica presented the Russian oil company with an outline of its datasets, capabilities and methodology. The presentation had little to do with “consumers”. Instead, documents show it focused on election disruption techniques. The first slide illustrates how a “rumour campaign” spread fear in the 2007 Nigerian election – in which the company worked – by spreading the idea that the “election would be rigged”. The final slide, branded with Lukoil’s logo and that of SCL Group and SCL Elections, headlines its “deliverables”: “psychographic messaging”.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Mercer with his daughter Rebekah. Photograph: Sean Zanni/Getty Images\n\nLukoil is a private company, but its CEO, Alekperov, answers to Putin, and it’s been used as a vehicle of Russian influence in Europe and elsewhere – including in the Czech Republic, where in 2016 it was revealed that an adviser to the strongly pro-Russian Czech president was being paid by the company.\n\nWhen I asked Bill Browder – an Anglo-American businessman who is leading a global campaign for a Magnitsky Act to enforce sanctions against Russian individuals – what he made of it, he said: “Everyone in Russia is subordinate to Putin. One should be highly suspicious of any Russian company pitching anything outside its normal business activities.”\n\nLast month, Nix told MPs on the parliamentary committee investigating fake news: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do not have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”\n\nThere’s no evidence that Cambridge Analytica ever did any work for Lukoil. What these documents show, though, is that in 2014 one of Russia’s biggest companies was fully briefed on: Facebook, microtargeting, data, election disruption.\n\nCambridge Analytica is “Chris’s Frankenstein”, says a friend of his. “He created it. It’s his data Frankenmonster. And now he’s trying to put it right.”\n\nOnly once has Wylie made the case of pointing out that he was 24 at the time. But he was. He thrilled to the intellectual possibilities of it. He didn’t think of the consequences. And I wonder how much he’s processed his own role or responsibility in it. Instead, he’s determined to go on the record and undo this thing he has created.\n\nBecause the past few months have been like watching a tornado gathering force. And when Wylie turns the full force of his attention to something – his strategic brain, his attention to detail, his ability to plan 12 moves ahead – it is sometimes slightly terrifying to behold. Dealing with someone trained in information warfare has its own particular challenges, and his suite of extraordinary talents include the kind of high-level political skills that makes House of Cards look like The Great British Bake Off. And not everyone’s a fan. Any number of ex-colleagues – even the ones who love him – call him “Machiavellian”. Another described the screaming matches he and Nix would have.\n\n“What do your parents make of your decision to come forward?” I ask him.\n\n“They get it. My dad sent me a cartoon today, which had two characters hanging off a cliff, and the first one’s saying ‘Hang in there.’ And the other is like: ‘Fuck you.’”\n\nWhich are you?\n\n“Probably both.”\n\nWhat isn’t in doubt is what a long, fraught journey it has been to get to this stage. And how fearless he is.\n\nAfter many months, I learn the terrible, dark backstory that throws some light on his determination, and which he discusses candidly. At six, while at school, Wylie was abused by a mentally unstable person. The school tried to cover it up, blaming his parents, and a long court battle followed. Wylie’s childhood and school career never recovered. His parents – his father is a doctor and his mother is a psychiatrist – were wonderful, he says. “But they knew the trajectory of people who are put in that situation, so I think it was particularly difficult for them, because they had a deeper understanding of what that does to a person long term.”\n\nFacebook has denied and denied this. It has failed in its duties to respect the law Paul-Olivier Dehaye\n\nHe says he grew up listening to psychologists discuss him in the third person, and, aged 14, he successfully sued the British Columbia Ministry of Education and forced it to change its inclusion policies around bullying. What I observe now is how much he loves the law, lawyers, precision, order. I come to think of his pink hair as a false-flag operation. What he cannot tolerate is bullying.\n\nIs what Cambridge Analytica does akin to bullying?\n\n“I think it’s worse than bullying,” Wylie says. “Because people don’t necessarily know it’s being done to them. At least bullying respects the agency of people because they know. So it’s worse, because if you do not respect the agency of people, anything that you’re doing after that point is not conducive to a democracy. And fundamentally, information warfare is not conducive to democracy.”\n\nRussia, Facebook, Trump, Mercer, Bannon, Brexit. Every one of these threads runs through Cambridge Analytica. Even in the past few weeks, it seems as if the understanding of Facebook’s role has broadened and deepened. The Mueller indictments were part of that, but Paul-Olivier Dehaye – a data expert and academic based in Switzerland, who published some of the first research into Cambridge Analytica’s processes – says it’s become increasingly apparent that Facebook is “abusive by design”. If there is evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, it will be in the platform’s data flows, he says. And Wylie’s revelations only move it on again.\n\n“Facebook has denied and denied and denied this,” Dehaye says when told of the Observer’s new evidence. “It has misled MPs and congressional investigators and it’s failed in its duties to respect the law. It has a legal obligation to inform regulators and individuals about this data breach, and it hasn’t. It’s failed time and time again to be open and transparent.”\n\nThe great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked Read more\n\nFacebook denies that the data transfer was a breach. In addition, a spokesperson said: “Protecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. If these reports are true, it’s a serious abuse of our rules. Both Aleksandr Kogan as well as the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica certified to us that they destroyed the data in question.”\n\nMillions of people’s personal information was stolen and used to target them in ways they wouldn’t have seen, and couldn’t have known about, by a mercenary outfit, Cambridge Analytica, who, Wylie says, “would work for anyone”. Who would pitch to Russian oil companies. Would they subvert elections abroad on behalf of foreign governments?\n\nIt occurs to me to ask Wylie this one night.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nNato or non-Nato?\n\n“Either. I mean they’re mercenaries. They’ll work for pretty much anyone who pays.”\n\nIt’s an incredible revelation. It also encapsulates all of the problems of outsourcing – at a global scale, with added cyberweapons. And in the middle of it all are the public – our intimate family connections, our “likes”, our crumbs of personal data, all sucked into a swirling black hole that’s expanding and growing and is now owned by a politically motivated billionaire.\n\nThe Facebook data is out in the wild. And for all Wylie’s efforts, there’s no turning the clock back.\n\nTamsin Shaw, a philosophy professor at New York University, and the author of a recent New York Review of Books article on cyberwar and the Silicon Valley economy, told me that she’d pointed to the possibility of private contractors obtaining cyberweapons that had at least been in part funded by US defence.\n\nShe calls Wylie’s disclosures “wild” and points out that “the whole Facebook project” has only been allowed to become as vast and powerful as it has because of the US national security establishment.\n\n“It’s a form of very deep but soft power that’s been seen as an asset for the US. Russia has been so explicit about this, paying for the ads in roubles and so on. It’s making this point, isn’t it? That Silicon Valley is a US national security asset that they’ve turned on itself.”\n\nOr, more simply: blowback.\n\n• Revealed: 50m Facebook profiles harvested in major data breach\n\n• How ‘likes’ became a political weapon\n\nThis article was amended on 18 March 2018 to clarify the full title of the British Columbia Ministry of Education",

    "article_text": "Data company gave briefing to Moscow firm Lukoil, and the lecturer who developed the crucial algorithm worked for St Petersburg university\n\nAleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University academic who orchestrated the harvesting of Facebook data, had previously unreported ties to a Russian university, including a teaching position and grants for research into the social media network, the Observer has discovered. Cambridge Analytica, the data firm he worked with – which funded the project to turn tens of millions of Facebook profiles into a unique political weapon – also attracted interest from a key Russian firm with links to the Kremlin.\n\nEnergy firm Lukoil, which is now on the US sanctions list and has been used as a vehicle of government influence, saw a presentation on the firm’s work in 2014. It began with a focus on voter suppression in Nigeria, and Cambridge Analytica also discussed “micro-targeting” individuals on social media during elections.\n\nThe revelations come at a time of intense US scrutiny of Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election, with 13 Russians criminally charged last month with interfering to help Donald Trump.\n\nIn Britain, concerns about Russian propaganda have been mounting, with the prime minister, Theresa May, recently attacking Russia for spreading fake news, accusing Moscow of attempts to “weaponise information” and influence polls.\n\nLukoil, Russia’s second-largest oil company, discussed with Cambridge Analytica the data company’s powerful social media marketing system, which was already being deployed for Republican Ted Cruz in the US presidential primaries and was later used to back Brexit and Trump.\n\nAlexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, emailed colleagues after initial contacts to say that Lukoil wanted a clearer explanation of “how our services are going to apply to the petroleum business”.\n\n“They understand behavioural micro-targeting in the context of elections (as per your excellent document/white paper) but they are failing to make the connection between voters and their consumers,” he wrote in an email seen by the Observer.\n\nA slide presentation prepared for the Lukoil pitch focuses first on election disruption strategies used by Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL, in Nigeria. They are presented under the heading “Election: Inoculation”, a military term used in “psychological operations” and disinformation campaigns. Other SCL documents show that the material shared with Lukoil included posters and videos apparently aimed at alarming or demoralising voters, including warnings of violence and fraud.\n\nDiscussion of services offered by Cambridge Analytica was apparently going right to the top of Lukoil, even though its retail operations in America are a very minor corner of the oil and gas giant’s empire. Asking for a detailed presentation of Cambridge Analyticas’s work in July 2014, Nix told his colleague the document would be “shared with the CEO of the business”.\n\nThe chief executive of Lukoil, Vagit Alekperov, is a former Soviet oil minister who has said the strategic aims of Lukoil are closely aligned with those of Russia. “I have only one task connected with politics, to help the country and the company. I’m not close to Mr Putin, but I treat him with great respect,” he told the New York Times.\n\nCambridge Analytica said an affiliate company had talked to Lukoil Turkey about a loyalty card scheme and proposed a pilot study with a small number of petrol stations there, but the project had not gone ahead. “[The talks] were about potential commercial work in Turkey and did not involve any discussion of political work,” a spokesman said. “Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate companies have not worked in Russia and have not worked for a Russian company or organisation.”\n\nLast month Nix told MPs: “We have never worked with a Russian organisation in Russia or any other company. We do no have any relationship with Russia or Russian individuals.”\n\nThat appears to contradict the company documents seen by the Observer, that list Russia as one of the countries where Cambridge Analytica and affiliate companies have clients.\n\nChristopher Wylie, the whistleblower who has come forward to talk to the Observer, said it was never entirely clear what the Russian firm hoped to get from the operation.\n\n“Alexander Nix’s presentation didn’t make any sense to me,” said Wylie, who left Cambridge Analytica soon after the initial meetings. “If this was a commercial deal, why were they so interested in our political targeting?”\n\nLukoil did not respond to requests for comments.\n\nKogan, a lecturer who worked with Cambridge Analytica on building up the database of US voters then at the heart of the company’s plans, said he had not had any connection to the Lukoil pitch.\n\nPlay Video 13:04 Cambridge Analytica whistleblower: 'We spent $1m harvesting millions of Facebook profiles' – video\n\nBut while he was helping turn Facebook profiles into a political tool he was also an associate professor at St Petersburg State University, taking Russian government grants to fund other research into social media. “Stress, health, and psychological wellbeing in social networks: cross-cultural investigation” was the title of one piece of research. Online posts showed Kogan lecturing in Russian. One talk was called: “New methods of communication as an effective political instrument”.\n\nCambridge University said academics are allowed to take on outside work but are expected to inform their head of institution, a rule Kogan had complied with. “We understand that Dr Kogan informed his head of department of discussions with St Petersburg University regarding a collaboration; it was understood that this work and any associated grants would be in a private capacity,” a spokesman said.\n\nApart from that, Kogan appears to have largely kept the work private. Colleagues said they had not heard about the post in St Petersburg. “I am very surprised by that. No one knew,” one academic who asked not to be named told the Observer. Russia is not mentioned in a 10-page CV Kogan posted on a university website in 2015. The CV lists undergraduate prizes and grants of a few thousand dollars and links to dozens of media interviews.\n\nOne Cambridge Analytica employee mentioned Kogan’s Russian work in an email to Nix in March 2014 discussing a pitch to a Caribbean nation for a security contract, including “criminal psychographic profiling via intercepts”.\n\n“We may want to either loop in or find out a bit more about the interesting work Alex Kogan has been doing for the Russians and see how/if it applies,” the colleague wrote.\n\nKogan told the Observer: “Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way. No data or models.” His recollection was that the Russia project had started a year after his collaboration with Cambridge Analytica ended.\n\nHe said the St Petersburg position emerged by chance on a social visit. A native Russian speaker, Kogan was born in Moldova and brought up in Moscow until he was seven, when his family emigrated to the US, where he later obtained citizenship.\n\nHowever, he stayed in touch with family friends in Russia and visited regularly. On one trip, he said, he “dropped an email” to the psychology department at St Petersburg.\n\n“We met, had a nice chat, and decided let’s try to collaborate – give me more reason to visit there,” he told the Observer in an email.",

    "article_text": "This video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason.\n\nBosses tell undercover reporters how honey traps, spies and fake news can be used to help clients\n\nThe company at the centre of the Facebook data breach boasted of using honey traps, fake news campaigns and operations with ex-spies to swing election campaigns around the world, a new investigation reveals.\n\nExecutives from Cambridge Analytica spoke to undercover reporters from Channel 4 News about the dark arts used by the company to help clients, which included entrapping rival candidates in fake bribery stings and hiring prostitutes to seduce them.\n\nIn one exchange, the company chief executive, Alexander Nix, is recorded telling reporters: “It sounds a dreadful thing to say, but these are things that don’t necessarily need to be true as long as they’re believed.”\n\nThe Channel 4 News investigation, broadcast on Monday, comes two days after the Observer reported Cambridge Analytica had unauthorised access to tens of millions of Facebook profiles in one of the social media company’s biggest data breaches.\n\nProfile Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica Show Hide Name Alexander James Ashburner Nix Age 42 Education Eton, then Manchester University, where he studied history of art Career Nix worked as a financial analyst in Mexico and the UK before joining SCL, a strategic communications firm, in 2003. From 2007 he took over the company’s elections division, and claims to have worked on more than 40 campaigns globally. Many of SCL’s projects are secret, so that may be a low estimate. He set up Cambridge Analytica to work in America, with investment from US hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. He has been both hailed as a visionary – featuring on Wired’s list of “25 Geniuses who are creating the future of business” – and derided as a snake oil salesman. Controversies Cambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its role in elections on both sides of the Atlantic, working on Brexit and Donald Trump’s election team. It is a key subject in two inquiries in the UK – by the Electoral Commission, into the firm’s possible role in the EU referendum, and the Information Commissioner’s Office, into data analytics for political purposes – and one in the US, as part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump-Russia collusion. The Observer revealed this week that the company had harvested millions of Facebook profiles of US voters, in one of the tech giant’s biggest ever data breaches, and used them to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box. Emma Graham-Harrison Photograph: The Washington Post\n\nThe company, and Nix, are under pressure from politicians in the US and the UK to explain how it handled the data and what role the information played in its campaigns, if any.\n\nPlay Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer\n\nThe Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham criticised Cambridge Analytica for being “unco-operative” with her investigation as she confirmed that her watchdog would apply for a warrant to help her examine the firm’s activities.\n\nCambridge Analytica has sold itself as the ultimate hi-tech consultant, winning votes by using data to pinpoint target groups and design messages that will appeal powerfully to their interests, although it denies using Facebook information in its work.\n\n\n\nBut in the undercover investigation by Channel 4 News, in association with the Observer, executives claimed to offer a much darker range of services.\n\n\n\nNo 10 'very concerned' over Facebook data breach by Cambridge Analytica Read more\n\nIn a series of meetings with a reporter posing as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family seeking political influence, Cambridge Analytica executives initially denied the company was in the business of using entrapment techniques.\n\nBut Nix later detailed the dirty tricks the company would be prepared to pull behind the scenes to help its clients.\n\n\n\nWhen the reporter asked if Cambridge Analytica could offer investigations into the damaging secrets of rivals, Nix said it worked with former spies from Britain and Israel to look for political dirt. He also volunteered that his team were ready to go further than an investigation.\n\n\n\n“Oh, we do a lot more than that,” he said over dinner at an exclusive hotel in London. “Deep digging is interesting, but you know equally effective can be just to go and speak to the incumbents and to offer them a deal that’s too good to be true and make sure that that’s video recorded.\n\n“You know these sort of tactics are very effective, instantly having video evidence of corruption.”\n\nNix suggested one possible scenario, in which the managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division, Mark Turnbull, would pose as a wealthy developer looking to exchange campaign finance for land. “I’m a master of disguise,” Turnbull said.\n\nAnother option, Nix suggested, would be to create a sex scandal. “Send some girls around to the candidate’s house, we have lots of history of things,” he told the reporter. “We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what I’m saying.”\n\n\n\nHe said these were hypothetical scenarios, but suggested his ideas were based on precedent. “Please don’t pay too much attention to what I’m saying, because I’m just giving you examples of what can be done, what has been done.”\n\n\n\nAny work may have stayed out of the spotlight partly because Cambridge Analytica works hard to cover traces of its operations, Nix said, using a shifting network of names and front groups.\n\n\n\n“We’re used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows, and I look forward to building a very long-term and secretive relationship with you,” Nix told the source in a first phone call.\n\n\n\nCambridge Analytica sometimes contracts under a different name, so that there are no records of its involvement, Turnbull said. That does not only protect the company, but also makes its work more efficient, he is recorded saying.\n\n“It has to happen without anyone thinking it’s propaganda, because the moment you think ‘that’s propaganda’ the next question is: ‘Who’s put that out?’”\n\nHe added: “It may be that we have to contract under a different name ... a different entity, with a different name, so that no record exists with our name attached to this at all.”\n\nIn a recent project in eastern Europe, the company sent a team but “no one even knew they were there, they were just ghosted in, did the work, ghosted out”, Turnbull said.\n\nCovers include the setting up of fake academic projects, sometimes simply going in on tourist visas, as former employees have told the Guardian they did for US elections – apparently employed in violation of Federal law.\n\n\n\nNix also offered details regarding the services of professional ex-spies from Britain and Israel. “We have two projects at the moment, which involve doing deep deep depth research on the opposition and providing source ... really damaging source material, that we can decide how to deploy in the course of the campaign.”\n\nDenham told Channel 4 News that she had issued a demand for access to Cambridge Analytica earlier this month. They were given until 6pm on Monday to respond to it, but she said the company had been “unco-operative” with the investigation and that she would be applying to the courts on Tuesday for a warrant. “We need to get in there. We need to look at the databases. We need to look at the servers and understand how data was processed or deleted by Cambridge Analytica. There are a lot of conflicting stories about the data,” she said.\n\nCambridge Analytica said the Channel 4 News investigation contained false claims, factual inaccuracies and substantial mischaracterisations.\n\n\n\nIt accused Channel 4 of setting out to entrap staff by initiating a conversation about unethical practices. It rejected any suggestion that the company used fake news, honey traps, bribes or entrapment.\n\nIt said: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Anlytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever … Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.”\n\nOf the suggestions they used honey trap techniques, the company said: “Our executives humoured these questions and actively encouraged the prospective client to further disclose his intentions.”\n\nPlay Video 13:04 Cambridge Analytica whistleblower: 'We spent $1m harvesting millions of Facebook profiles' – video\n\nIn a later statement Cambridge Analytica accused Channel 4 News of attempting to entrap its executives by initiating a conversation about unethical practices, which it insisted the company did not use.\n\nAdmitting he misjudged the situation, Nix said: “In playing along with this line of conversation … we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios. I am aware how this looks … I deeply regret my role in the meeting and I have already apologised to staff. I should have recognised where the prospective client was taking our conversations and ended the relationship sooner.”\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Cambridge Analytica denied it had done anything wrong in relation to the handling of Facebook data.\n\n“Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations,” it said.",

    "article_text": "Sandy Parakilas says numerous companies deployed these techniques – likely affecting hundreds of millions of users – and that Facebook looked the other way\n\nHundreds of millions of Facebook users are likely to have had their private information harvested by companies that exploited the same terms as the firm that collected data and passed it on to Cambridge Analytica, according to a new whistleblower.\n\nSandy Parakilas, the platform operations manager at Facebook responsible for policing data breaches by third-party software developers between 2011 and 2012, told the Guardian he warned senior executives at the company that its lax approach to data protection risked a major breach.\n\nWhere's Zuck? Facebook CEO silent as data harvesting scandal unfolds Read more\n\n“My concerns were that all of the data that left Facebook servers to developers could not be monitored by Facebook, so we had no idea what developers were doing with the data,” he said.\n\nParakilas said Facebook had terms of service and settings that “people didn’t read or understand” and the company did not use its enforcement mechanisms, including audits of external developers, to ensure data was not being misused.\n\nParakilas, whose job was to investigate data breaches by developers similar to the one later suspected of Global Science Research, which harvested tens of millions of Facebook profiles and provided the data to Cambridge Analytica, said the slew of recent disclosures had left him disappointed with his superiors for not heeding his warnings.\n\n“It has been painful watching,” he said, “because I know that they could have prevented it.”\n\nPlay Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer\n\nAsked what kind of control Facebook had over the data given to outside developers, he replied: “Zero. Absolutely none. Once the data left Facebook servers there was not any control, and there was no insight into what was going on.”\n\nParakilas said he “always assumed there was something of a black market” for Facebook data that had been passed to external developers. However, he said that when he told other executives the company should proactively “audit developers directly and see what’s going on with the data” he was discouraged from the approach.\n\nHe said one Facebook executive advised him against looking too deeply at how the data was being used, warning him: “Do you really want to see what you’ll find?” Parakilas said he interpreted the comment to mean that “Facebook was in a stronger legal position if it didn’t know about the abuse that was happening”.\n\nHe added: “They felt that it was better not to know. I found that utterly shocking and horrifying.”\n\nParakilas first went public with his concerns about privacy at Facebook four months ago, but his direct experience policing Facebook data given to third parties throws new light on revelations over how such data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment on the information supplied by Parakilas, but directed the Guardian to a November 2017 blogpost in which the company defended its data sharing practices, which it said had “significantly improved” over the last five years.\n\n“While it’s fair to criticise how we enforced our developer policies more than five years ago, it’s untrue to suggest we didn’t or don’t care about privacy,” that statement said. “The facts tell a different story.”\n\n‘A majority of Facebook users’\n\nParakilas, 38, who now works as a product manager for Uber, is particularly critical of Facebook’s previous policy of allowing developers to access the personal data of friends of people who used apps on the platform, without the knowledge or express consent of those friends.\n\nThat feature, called friends permission, was a boon to outside software developers who, from 2007 onwards, were given permission by Facebook to build quizzes and games – like the widely popular FarmVille – that were hosted on the platform.\n\nThe apps proliferated on Facebook in the years leading up to the company’s 2012 initial public offering, an era when most users were still accessing the platform via laptops and computers rather than smartphones.\n\nFacebook took a 30% cut of payments made through apps, but in return enabled their creators to have access to Facebook user data.\n\nParakilas does not know how many companies sought friends permission data before such access was terminated around mid-2014. However, he said he believes tens or maybe even hundreds of thousands of developers may have done so.\n\nIt has been painful watching, because I know they could have prevented it\n\nParakilas estimates that “a majority of Facebook users” could have had their data harvested by app developers without their knowledge. The company now has stricter protocols around the degree of access third parties have to data.\n\nParakilas said that when he worked at Facebook it failed to take full advantage of its enforcement mechanisms, such as a clause that enables the social media giant to audit external developers who misuse its data.\n\nLegal action against rogue developers or moves to ban them from Facebook were “extremely rare”, he said, adding: “In the time I was there, I didn’t see them conduct a single audit of a developer’s systems.”\n\nFacebook announced on Monday that it had hired a digital forensics firm to conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica. The decision comes more than two years after Facebook was made aware of the reported data breach.\n\n\n\nDuring the time he was at Facebook, Parakilas said the company was keen to encourage more developers to build apps for its platform and “one of the main ways to get developers interested in building apps was through offering them access to this data”. Shortly after arriving at the company’s Silicon Valley headquarters he was told that any decision to ban an app required the personal approval of the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, although the policy was later relaxed to make it easier to deal with rogue developers.\n\nWhile the previous policy of giving developers access to Facebook users’ friends’ data was sanctioned in the small print in Facebook’s terms and conditions, and users could block such data sharing by changing their settings, Parakilas said he believed the policy was problematic.\n\n“It was well understood in the company that that presented a risk,” he said. “Facebook was giving data of people who had not authorised the app themselves, and was relying on terms of service and settings that people didn’t read or understand.”\n\nIt was this feature that was exploited by Global Science Research, and the data provided to Cambridge Analytica in 2014. GSR was run by the Cambridge University psychologist Aleksandr Kogan, who built an app that was a personality test for Facebook users.\n\nThe test automatically downloaded the data of friends of people who took the quiz, ostensibly for academic purposes. Cambridge Analytica has denied knowing the data was obtained improperly, and Kogan maintains he did nothing illegal and had a “close working relationship” with Facebook.\n\nWhile Kogan’s app only attracted around 270,000 users (most of whom were paid to take the quiz), the company was then able to exploit the friends permission feature to quickly amass data pertaining to more than 50 million Facebook users.\n\n“Kogan’s app was one of the very last to have access to friend permissions,” Parakilas said, adding that many other similar apps had been harvesting similar quantities of data for years for commercial purposes. Academic research from 2010, based on an analysis of 1,800 Facebooks apps, concluded that around 11% of third-party developers requested data belonging to friends of users.\n\nIf those figures were extrapolated, tens of thousands of apps, if not more, were likely to have systematically culled “private and personally identifiable” data belonging to hundreds of millions of users, Parakilas said.\n\nThe ease with which it was possible for anyone with relatively basic coding skills to create apps and start trawling for data was a particular concern, he added.\n\nParakilas said he was unsure why Facebook stopped allowing developers to access friends data around mid-2014, roughly two years after he left the company. However, he said he believed one reason may have been that Facebook executives were becoming aware that some of the largest apps were acquiring enormous troves of valuable data.\n\nHe recalled conversations with executives who were nervous about the commercial value of data being passed to other companies.\n\n“They were worried that the large app developers were building their own social graphs, meaning they could see all the connections between these people,” he said. “They were worried that they were going to build their own social networks.”\n\n‘They treated it like a PR exercise’\n\nParakilas said he lobbied internally at Facebook for “a more rigorous approach” to enforcing data protection, but was offered little support. His warnings included a PowerPoint presentation he said he delivered to senior executives in mid-2012 “that included a map of the vulnerabilities for user data on Facebook’s platform”.\n\n“I included the protective measures that we had tried to put in place, where we were exposed, and the kinds of bad actors who might do malicious things with the data,” he said. “On the list of bad actors I included foreign state actors and data brokers.”\n\nFrustrated at the lack of action, Parakilas left Facebook in late 2012. “I didn’t feel that the company treated my concerns seriously. I didn’t speak out publicly for years out of self-interest, to be frank.”\n\nHow to protect your Facebook privacy – or delete yourself completely Read more\n\nThat changed, Parakilas said, when he heard the congressional testimony given by Facebook lawyers to Senate and House investigators in late 2017 about Russia’s attempt to sway the presidential election. “They treated it like a PR exercise,” he said. “They seemed to be entirely focused on limiting their liability and exposure rather than helping the country address a national security issue.”\n\nIt was at that point that Parakilas decided to go public with his concerns, writing an opinion article in the New York Times that said Facebook could not be trusted to regulate itself. Since then, Parakilas has become an adviser to the Center for Humane Technology, which is run by Tristan Harris, a former Google employee turned whistleblower on the industry.",

    "article_text": "Brittany Kaiser talks about her time inside the controversial political data firm and why she is speaking out now\n\nFormer Cambridge Analytica exec says she wants lies to stop\n\nIt was the summer of 2007. Brittany Kaiser was not yet 21, but she was one of a handful of full-time workers in the small digital team for Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, uploading photos of the Illinois senator to something called a Facebook page.\n\nAt the next desk was another activist who knew a bit about the social media startup. Chris Hughes, 24, had worked with his Harvard roommate Mark Zuckerberg to create Facebook as a tool for students a few years earlier.\n\nA decade later, the picture has darkened, as Hughes recently lamented when he complained about the “negative role” Facebook is playing in politics.\n\nAnd Kaiser, who until two weeks ago was a senior employee at Cambridge Analytica, has worked for a company involved in two of the most negative and controversial campaigns in history.\n\nNow she wants to make those secrets public, becoming the second former Cambridge Analytica employee to come forward in less than a week.\n\nHer motive for doing so is likely to come under scrutiny: this has been a catastrophic week for the firm – and Kaiser was a senior executive. She claims, however, that it is because she wants to stop telling lies.\n\nIt seems remarkable that an Obama volunteer who studied human rights and voted for Bernie Sanders ended up working for a controversial data analytics company at the centre of a global story about the use of data and dirty tricks.\n\nThe company’s work on Donald Trump’s election campaign left her feeling “incredibly internally conflicted”, but she insists she was only doing her job; her political views have nothing to do with her decision to reveal secrets about Cambridge Analytica.\n\nAsked why she has decided to speak out, Kaiser flares: “Why should we make excuses for these people? Why? I’m so tired of making excuses for old white men. Fucking hell.”\n\nShe says she believes that Silicon Valley has much to answer for. “There’s a much wider story that I think needs to be told about how people can protect themselves, and their own data.”\n\nHer disclosures come almost a week after the Observer revealed new information on how data was acquired from more than 50 million Facebook friends without their consent.\n\nKaiser has less to say on the harvesting of this data in 2014 than she does on other issues, which is corroborated by emails, correspondence and other documents reviewed by the Guardian.\n\nHer own journey – from Obama’s campaign to trying to secure business with political parties and corporate interests in Ethiopia, Lithuania, Romania, Nigeria and Zambia; and from Occupy to Trump’s presidential victory party – says much about the bizarre state of politics in the digital era.\n\n**********\n\nFacebook was not all Kaiser and Hughes had in common when they met at Obama’s Chicago HQ; they had attended the same prestigious private school in Massachusetts. Now they were among fewer than a dozen Obama activists and volunteers on the “new media” team.\n\nHughes, though, stood apart. He was apparently still able to pull strings at Facebook, which had relocated to California. When the campaign noticed problematic things about the social media site, such as the deluge of racist and abusive material being posted on the senator’s “wall”, Hughes, it seems, could find a solution.\n\nOn that occasion, Kaiser says, the platform was changed so that campaign workers could pre-approve messages before they appeared.\n\nAnother leap forward for Obama 2008’s Facebook experiment was their response to the avalanche of “friend” requests tying up campaign resources, with volunteers having to check photos. “We didn’t want a media controversy around Barack Obama being friends with somebody that was naked with an assault rifle,” she says.\n\nThe solution was a change that meant fans could “follow” Obama’s campaign rather than request a “friend connection”.\n\nFor the next few years, Kaiser says, her career diverged from US politics: she was a marketing officer for London’s air ambulance, volunteered for human rights groups, lived in Asia and started an inward-investment company in Libya – primarily, she claims, to gain access to the country for human rights work.\n\nThese opaque foreign adventures appear to have caught the eye of the SCL Group, a British psy-ops company, and its ambitious chief executive, Alexander Nix. Kaiser said she first met Nix at a sushi restaurant with some Mongolian clients. He drilled her as a spy might a source, apparently telling her: “Let me get you drunk and steal your secrets.”\n\nThat was 2012, the year Obama was re-elected, this time on a much more sophisticated campaign whose backbone was “big data” and Facebook friend networks, using techniques that foreshadowed much of what was to come.\n\nKaiser recalls Nix getting excited when she told him she’d worked for Obama.\n\nKaiser worked for SCL until Cambridge Analytica was formally incorporated.\n\nNix, she says, saw the gap in the market. The Republicans were losing the data race; that was where the opportunities were.\n\nThe kind of personality questionnaires conducted by the Cambridge psychologist Aleksandr Kogan on Facebook were particularly important, she adds, as they allowed the company’s data scientists to build models connecting data to behavioral traits and build “a very in-depth picture on those individuals”.\n\nKogan paid about 270,000 people to take his personality test. But, Kaiser says, Cambridge Analytica did many similar quizzes – not always on Facebook – and had personality data for more than 2 million Americans.\n\n“The bigger a data set that you have, the more polls, the more surveys that you have that people undertake, the more accurate your models are going to be,” she says. “That’s just a fact of data science.”\n\nAround mid-2015, Kaiser says, the company knew Facebook was changing its API rules to restrict the data that could be harvested through questionnaires like Kogan’s.\n\nThis appears to have prompted a last-minute grab for data. In one internal email seen by the Guardian, employees are asked to identify which issues on a list of 500 Facebook “like” items would be most “useful for political modeling or commercial sales”.\n\nIt is unclear from the email where the data was coming from, but the list is curiously revealing. Cambridge Analytica didn’t want to know who “liked” Eminem, Family Guy, YouTube, The Walking Dead or Mountain Dew. It was, however, interested in Facebook users who “liked” Mitt Romney, Walt Disney World, the US Marine Corps and Coca-Cola.\n\n********\n\n\n\nNigeria was one of Kaiser’s first assignments. Three days ago, in one of a series of extraordinary scoops, the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr revealed details about this project, aimed at securing the re-election of the then president, Goodluck Jonathan. He was unaware of Cambridge Analytica’s involvement.\n\nCambridge Analytica's ruthless bid to sway the vote in Nigeria Read more\n\nCadwalladr revealed details of a murky operation by suspected Israeli hackers to discredit Johnson’s rival, Muhammadu Buhari, by finding “kompromat” on the Nigerian politician. Asked about this, Kaiser confirms she knew the Israeli contractors.\n\n“They were working for the same client that we were working for.” Who was that? “Oil billionaires,” she replies.\n\nKaiser’s story of how the Israelis got their information, however, was worse than computer hacking.\n\n“They went to Nigeria, became friends with the people in Buhari’s campaign, and started sitting in meetings in the campaign headquarters,” she says. “They got information by being in there, however you do that. Making friends with people, sitting in high-level meetings, working on their computers.”\n\nThis, she claims, was being done independently of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nEarlier this week there was another scoop, based on undercover footage from C4 News which captured Nix boasting about using “honey traps”, fake news campaigns and operations with ex-spies to swing election campaigns around the world.\n\n\n\nKaiser claims she had never heard him make such claims before. “Alexander is known to oversell everything to close the deal.”\n\nBy 2015, Nix and Kaiser were pitching to increase their market share in the most lucrative market of all: the US presidential campaign.\n\nCambridge Analytica had already worked for several 2014 midterm candidates, Super Pacs and foundations. Consultants usually limit themselves to one presidential campaign, but Cambridge Analytica ended up working for two Republican primary candidates: Ted Cruz and Ben Carson.\n\nPrior to that, Kaiser says, the company also made unsuccessful bids for business with Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie.\n\nCambridge Analytica scandal: the biggest revelations so far Read more\n\nThat same year, a former Florida governor with a famous name who many suspected would secure the nomination also visited Cambridge Analytica’s London office. Kaiser says she never met Jeb Bush, but that according to Nix, the Republican political scion wanted the firm to join his future campaign for the White House.\n\nShe claims Nix always saw political campaigning as a springboard to a bigger mission.\n\n“To become a famous advertising company in the US market; that’s what he planned from the beginning,” she says. “Alexander Nix has no interest in the Republicans or Democrats winning or losing.”\n\nThat does not seem to tally with the ideological zeal driving Cambridge Analytica’s patrons, the Republican billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah, who later bankrolled Trump’s campaign. They worked closely with Steve Bannon, whose townhouse on Capitol Hill – an office for Breitbart, and a nerve-centre for his political operations – has become something of a legend in Washington.\n\n“Yes, ‘The Embassy’,” Kaiser recalls, adding: “I used to actually share a key with Alexander to that house.”\n\nIt was not until mid-2016 that Cambridge Analytica finally got the biggest ticket in Beltway politics: a contract with the presidential campaign.\n\nIt immediately sent a team of data scientists and political strategists to San Antonio, Texas, where the digital campaign was being run. Others went to the headquarters in Trump Towers, New York.\n\nQuestions have been asked about the legality of a London-based company, with a largely British staff, working on the campaign. Kaiser cannot answer them definitively.\n\nWhat she does know is where Nix was on the night Trump was elected, because she was there too: at the Republicans’ victory party in New York, standing next to the Mercers.\n\nIn her pocket, Kaiser says, she also had a ticket to Hillary Clinton’s election night party. But when the TV screens “started going red state, red state, red state” before declaring Trump the victor, she knew she didn’t need it.\n\nKaiser says she turned to the Mercers, who were not watching the screen, and relayed the news. “You could just see them looking at each other, like: ‘Holy shit … we just became the most powerful people in politics’.” According to her account, Nix told her: “We did it.”\n\nKaiser says she felt conflicted about Trump’s victory, and still does.\n\nHer testimony, relayed to the Guardian in recent days in a variety of Silicon Valley locations, raises many questions – about what she says now, and what she did for the company.\n\nIt will not be easy for Kaiser to put her past behind her.\n\n“Corporations like Google, Facebook, Amazon, all of these large companies, are making tens or hundreds of billions of dollars off of monetising people’s data,” Kaiser says. “I’ve been telling companies and governments for years that data is probably your most valuable asset. Individuals should be able to monetise their own data – that’s their own human value – not to be exploited.”\n\nAsked if she has any regrets, Kaiser says she does.\n\n“To be honest, I regret not spending all those years only working for causes I believed in, and instead just learning about how to achieve an end – how to get a result. I really know how to get a result now – and I can do it for anybody.”",

    "article_text": "Investigators from Britain’s data watchdog have spent nearly seven hours searching the London offices of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nEighteen enforcement officers entered the Cambridge Analytica headquarters in London’s West End on Friday night to search the premises after the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) was granted a warrant to examine its records.\n\nThe officials concluded the search at about 3am on Saturday.\n\n“We will now need to assess and consider the evidence before deciding the next steps and coming to any conclusions,” an ICO spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nA judge had issued the warrant on Friday evening, four days after the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, first announced plans to raid the offices.\n\nDenham has been seeking access to records held by the London-based data analytics company, which faces allegations it may have illegally acquired the information of millions of Facebook users and used it to profile and target voters during political campaigns.\n\nCambridge Analytica misled MPs over work for Leave.EU, says ex-director Read more\n\nMr Justice Leonard granted the warrant after a five-hour hearing at the Royal Courts of Justice, adjourned from Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for the ICO said: “This is just one part of a larger investigation into the use of personal data and analytics for political purposes.”\n\nThe focus of the data watchdog’s investigation includes the acquisition and use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica, its parent company, SCL, and Dr Aleksandr Kogan, the academic who developed the app used to gather the data.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An ICO enforcement officer in Cambridge Analytica’s offices on Friday night. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA\n\nThe growing scandal stems from claims over the harvesting of personal data and whether it was used to affect the outcome of Donald Trump’s US presidential campaign and the EU referendum.\n\nLess than an hour after the warrant was granted a group of 18 people, some wearing ICO enforcement jackets, entered the building from New Oxford Street, led by a woman holding a piece of paper that appeared to be a warrant.\n\nThe enforcement officers were seen on the second floor – where Cambridge Analytica is thought to have its offices.\n\nIt is understood they were searching for correspondence and communications between SCL and Kogan’s company Global Science Research (GSR), as well as data obtained from Facebook via Kogan.\n\nNews of the raid came as the acting CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Dr Alexander Tayler, who was appointed after the suspension of Alexander Nix, issued an apology about the way some data had been collected by an affiliate company.\n\nQ&A How did the Cambridge Analytica story unfold? Show Hide Saturday 17 March The Observer publishes online its first story on the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal, written by Carole Cadwalladr and Emma Graham-Harrison. Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie reveals how the firm used personal information taken in early 2014 to build a system that could profile individual US voters. The data was collected through an app, built by academic Aleksandr Kogan, separately from his work at Cambridge University, through his company Global Science Research (GSR). Sunday 18 March As the Observer publishes its full interview with Wylie in the print edition, the fallout begins. US congressional investigators call for Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix to testify again before their committee. Monday 19 March Channel 4 News airs the findings of an undercover investigation where Cambridge Analytica executives ​boast of using honey traps, fake news campaigns and operations with ex-spies to swing election campaigns. Tuesday 20 March ​A former Facebook employee claims​ hundreds of millions of Facebook users may have had their private information harvested by companies in similar methods. Wednesday 21 March UK MPs summon Mark Zuckerberg to appear before a select committee investigating fake news, and accuse Facebook of misleading them at a previous hearing. Thursday 22 March It emerges Facebook had previously provided Kogan with an anonymised, aggregate dataset of 57bn Facebook friendships. Zuckerberg breaks his silence to call the misuse of data a 'breach of trust'. Friday 23 March Brittany Kaiser, formerly Cambridge Analytica’s business development director, reveals the blueprint for how CA claimed to have won the White House for Donald Trump by using Google, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.\n\nPhotograph: Antonio Olmos\n\n“I am sorry that, in 2014, SCL Elections [an affiliate of Cambridge Analytica] licensed Facebook data from a research company [GSR] that had not received consent from respondents,” he said. “The company believed the data had been obtained in line with Facebook’s terms of service and data protection laws.\n\n“We are now undertaking an independent, third-party audit to verify that we do not hold any GSR data.”\n\nTayler went on to deny that a former employee who provided documents and information about Cambridge Analytica to the Observer was a whistleblower.\n\nLeaked: Cambridge Analytica's blueprint for Trump victory Read more\n\nHe said: “The source of allegations against the company is not a whistleblower or a founder of the company. Christopher Wylie was a part-time contractor who left in July 2014 and has no direct knowledge of our work or practices since that date.\n\n“He was at the company for less than a year, after which he was made the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent his misuse of the company’s intellectual property while attempting to set up his own rival firm.”\n\nMeanwhile, pressure is mounting on the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who has been called to give evidence to MPs.\n\nPlay Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer\n\nCambridge Analytica, SCL, Kogan and Facebook deny any wrongdoing.\n\nEarlier in the week, the culture secretary, Matt Hancock, hinted that the government would consider further strengthening the information commissioner’s powers to investigate the misuse of personal data amid criticism that it had taken so long to get a search warrant.\n\nFollowing Friday’s hearing, Leonard said he would outline the reasons for his decision on Tuesday.",

    "article_text": "When I first met Shahmir Sanni last August, he was nervy, anxious, uncertain. “I’ve just started piecing it together,” he said, in what was our first off-the-record conversation. “All this stuff I didn’t realise at the time.” Stuff that a series of investigations and news articles had forced him to start thinking about. “Was I just really naive?” he asked. Then later: “Do you think they just used me?”\n\nIt’s been a painful question for Sanni, one that he’s struggled with over a period of months. Now, though, he thinks that, yes, he was used; that he and his friend, Darren Grimes, were taken advantage of by people they respected and trusted, and that the consequences of it are profound, far reaching, and go well beyond his own personal feelings of hurt and betrayal.\n\nIn early 2016, Sanni was a 22-year-old recent graduate, volunteering with Vote Leave, the official campaign to leave the European Union led by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. It was one of his first pieces of work experience after graduating from the University of East Anglia with a degree in economics, and for someone who describes himself as a “natural Eurosceptic” it was a plum role. “It was like a startup. Everyone was throwing ideas around and saying different things. You’re given a lot of creative freedom.” He was still living at home in Solihull, but was travelling in by train, a few days each week, to work in Vote Leave’s headquarters at Millbank Tower in London, overlooking the Thames.\n\nPlay Video 10:30 The Brexit whistleblower: 'Not cheating is the core of what it means to be British' – video\n\nVote Leave’s senior directors were quick to realise how useful he would be for the campaign. “A huge part of campaigns is to make sure you diversify,” says Sanni. “And we discussed how crucial it was that Vote Leave didn’t appear racist.”\n\nSo, it was: “Here’s the brown guy”?\n\n“Exactly,” he says.\n\nIt was a role he was happy to play, though, helping with their black and ethnic minority outreach efforts. “At university all my friends were ‘Remain, Remain, Remain’, but when I started doing research into it, I realised I’m a nerdy Eurosceptic. And even after all this, I would still vote Leave.”\n\n“All this” is why Sanni is talking today. Because it’s what happened next that’s the issue – a sequence of events that began in March 2016, when one of Vote Leave’s senior directors, Stephen Parkinson, who is now Theresa May’s political secretary, asked Sanni if he would be interested in helping with one of Vote Leave’s official youth groups, BeLeave.\n\n“BeLeave was very progressive; it was aimed at young, liberal Leavers. They were talking about African farmers being discriminated against… it totally aligned with my values.”\n\nBeLeave had been set up and was being run from within Vote Leave’s HQ by another volunteer, 23-year-old fashion student Darren Grimes, whose main role was creating ads and messaging to share on social media. “His content was just really, really good. They were just cool, simple graphics that people would share. His creative side shone through. Everyone recognised that.”\n\nSanni continued to campaign for Vote Leave, but he was also now helping BeLeave. Then about a month before the referendum, “Cleo tells us someone, a sponsor, wants to give money to BeLeave”.\n\nThis was Cleo Watson, another senior director at Vote Leave – its head of outreach. Now, like Parkinson, Watson works at No 10 Downing Street, as political adviser to Theresa May.\n\nWhen Watson said a donor had expressed interest in giving money to BeLeave so it could expand its work, Sanni and Grimes wrote a proposal. They could treble the impact of their Facebook content, they reckoned, if they could get a few thousand pounds to spend on ads. “We were like: ‘If we had £10,000, this is what we could do: we could have X number of paid adverts and reach so many people.’”\n\nQuick guide Key players in the Vote Leave campaign Show Hide Vote Leave: the key players Dominic Cummings Campaign director of Vote Leave and former special adviser to Michael Gove, the 46-year-old from Durham has been described as an “optimistic Eurosceptic” by the Economist. Cummings is regarded as the leading strategist of the campaign. He is credited with creating the memorable official slogan of Vote Leave: “take back control”. Matthew Elliott (pictured)\n\nChief executive of Vote Leave, the 40-year-old political strategist from Leeds has been described by the BBC as “one of the most effective lobbyists at Westminster”. Elliott is a former chief executive of Big Brother Watch, Business for Britain and the TaxPayers’ Alliance. He is currently editor-at-large of BrexitCentral. Stephen Parkinson\n\nThe national organiser of the ground operation for Vote Leave, Parkinson is from North Shields and was a special adviser to Theresa May when she was home secretary. Following the EU referendum victory he rejoined her as a special adviser based in Downing Street. His current official title is political secretary to the prime minister. Victoria Woodcock\n\nVote Leave’s operations director. Credited by Cummings with winning the referendum: he described her as “the most indispensable person in the campaign – if she’d gone under a bus, Remain would have won.” Vote Leave’s powerful ‘Voter Intention Collection System’ (Vics) software was named after her.

Boris Johnson\n\nA figurehead of Vote Leave and member of the campaign committee that met weekly during the referendum to set its campaign strategy. The 53-year-old Old Etonian is currently foreign secretary. Michael Gove\n\nCo-convener of Vote Leave’s campaign committee, the 50-year-old is currently environment secretary. Previously he has served as education secretary and justice secretary.\n\nWatson told them they needed to speak to Vote Leave’s internal lawyer and head of compliance. “And he said the only way to get money was to set [BeLeave] up as a separate organisation. So, we were like: ‘OK, cool. How do we do that?’ And so he wrote up the constitution for us. And Darren put his own name on it. Because that’s what he was told to do.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An example of BeLeave’s campaign messaging. ‘BeLeave was very progressive,’ says Sanni. ‘It was aimed at young, liberal Leavers.’ Photograph: BeLeave\n\nThe lawyer helped Sanni and Grimes to draw up the documents, which they signed on 18 May, and he told them to open a bank account.\n\nBut no donor ever materialised. Later, in the crucial final fortnight before the referendum, the talk in the Vote Leave office was about how the campaign was both running out of money and about to hit its spending limit of £7m. And then, 10 days before the referendum, Vote Leave learned that they had received a donation of £1m. Because of their spending limits, they suggested this could be given as a donation to BeLeave. Not the few thousand pounds they had asked for, though. The proposed sum was initially £400,000 but ended up close to £700,000.\n\nWhat was your reaction?\n\n“We were ecstatic. It was amazing. Can you imagine… you’re 22 and you’re given nearly a million pounds? I think I added that to my LinkedIn profile that same day.”\n\nToday, though, for Sanni, that campaign, the money, the creative work, and everything associated with it is tainted. What he has spent months coming to terms with is that this donation may not have had anything to do with BeLeave’s creativity and flair. “Vote Leave didn’t really give us that money,” he says. “They just pretended to. We had no control over it. We were 22-year-old students. You’re not going to just give nearly a million pounds to a pair of students and let them do whatever.”\n\nTo Sanni’s mind, what this means is: “They cheated.”\n\nThe question is whether this was a strategy to get around the strict electoral spending limits enforced by law. If election campaigns coordinate, they have to declare their spending together. Spending limits are the bedrock of our parliamentary democracy: our electoral laws control the amount of money that can be spent in elections – which for the official designated campaign group is £7m. But a perfectly legal loophole exists: separate campaigns can spend up to £700,000 in excess of that. Just as long as they don’t co-ordinate – or, in the Electoral Commission’s words, “work together”.\n\nSo was BeLeave a separate campaign? Vote Leave insist it was and the Electoral Commission agreed back in April 2017. But Sanni – and he has a wealth of documents – now thinks it wasn’t. He believes BeLeave “worked together” with Vote Leave.\n\n“It’s a lie. The whole thing. It was never separate.” And he has a whole dossier of emails, text messages and other files. What’s more: “They told us to set up the bank account, but no money ever went into it. I was the treasurer and secretary of BeLeave and I never saw the money. I had no control over it. It was Vote Leave who decided everything.” The money went straight to Vote Leave’s Canadian data analytics firm – AggregateIQ (AIQ).\n\nIt’s an extraordinary revelation. The Observer has been one of a number of publications and campaign groups that have picked away at the story behind this donation. Because one thing is clear: something smelled bad. It’s been the subject of two Electoral Commission investigations, an inquiry by the Information Commissioner’s Office, numerous Freedom of Information requests, multiple articles and a judicial review. The latest investigation is still live. And nobody has yet been able to answer the question posed in the very first article by BuzzFeed on 2 August 2016: “Why did Vote Leave donate £625,000 to a 23-year-old fashion student during the referendum?”\n\nUntil now. Because Sanni knows exactly why. “We were two broke college students. Darren’s working-class as well. And it’s his name all over this. He’s the one being investigated. It’s his name on the form. And he just did what Vote Leave told him.”\n\n17 days after an investigation opened, Vote Leave's COO deleted herself and two others from over 100 files\n\nSanni is quite profoundly anti-Europe. He doesn’t believe in what he calls EU “passport discrimination”. And having moved here from Pakistan, he loves this country with the passion that, he says, maybe only an immigrant can feel. “Britain saved my family,” he says. “I voted Leave. And if there was a second referendum, I would vote Leave again. But I now know my vote was based on cheating. And that’s what I cannot stand.”\n\nTo say it’s a brave decision to come forward is a huge understatement. Sanni is still only 24. The CEO of Vote Leave, Matthew Elliott, is the co-founder of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, where Sanni works as digital campaign manager. And a lot of his friends are still in that same pro-Brexit world, including Darren Grimes, who now works for the website BrexitCentral where Matthew Elliott is editor at large.\n\nSanni lives in BrexitLand. His career has been built on Brexit. And his decision to come forward has been far from straightforward. Back in August, we discussed him going on the record anonymously, but even that felt too risky. He was worried about his mother – a teacher who came to Britain as a single mother from Pakistan less than a decade ago – and his two sisters. But it’s also part of what has prompted his decision.\n\n“I’m from Pakistan. And for someone that came here seeking a new life, a better life, one where my mum and my sisters could live freely, in a country where my decision as a voter actually matters and is truthful… this is a huge deal.”\n\nThe first inkling that something wasn’t right came when journalists from BuzzFeed and Private Eye got sight of BeLeave’s audit to the Electoral Commission and found what BuzzFeed noted was “a highly unusual transfer of funds”. Namely that Darren Grimes was recorded as having received a total of £675,315 in four donations spread over eight days shortly before polling day – on 13, 16, 20 and 21 June.\n\nSanni shrugged it off. “I just thought: ‘Oh, this is how politics is. It’s remoaners trying to smear us and our hard work.’”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shahmir Sanni and Darren Grimes canvassing for BeLeave during the 2016 EU referendum campaign. Photograph: Shahmir Sanni\n\nBut Grimes was less sanguine. Sanni still has his Facebook messages, which show his confusion and panic. “I’ve had three journalists this morning,” one says. “I don’t know if I should go back to GP and be like I’m dying or just fight through it.” (A reference, Sanni says, to the state of his health.) Grimes then forwarded an email he’d received from a Vote Leave director: “So as discussed we think you should refuse to speak to hacks about it and just email them something like this: ‘We received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.’”\n\nIn the BuzzFeed article, Grimes says: “We received donations in a standard legal way and have reported them according to the rules.”\n\nWhat Sanni believes, and says is reflected in the multiple pages of evidence that he has gathered, is that Vote Leave directed BeLeave’s actions before it became a separate campaign, after it became a separate campaign, and throughout the referendum.\n\nWhat’s also clear, in the pages of messages from Grimes, is how the donation – which has put him front and centre of the media coverage – has affected him. His messages to Sanni make distressing reading. As a teenager, Grimes was bullied. He grew up in a working-class community in County Durham, and Sanni describes him as sensitive and vulnerable to criticism.\n\nWhen the letter arrived from the Electoral Commission, announcing it needed to make an “assessment”, he really started to panic. “He rang me up and told me to delete my emails. I didn’t understand it. I said: ‘We’ve done nothing wrong. Don’t worry about it.’ But he was panicking. So I just did it.”\n\nSanni still had no inkling that there was anything seriously amiss. “We were advised every step of the way by Vote Leave’s lawyers. They literally told us what to do and where to sign. I couldn’t understand how we had done anything wrong.”\n\nAnd then he found the drive: a shared Google drive that Vote Leave had set up and that has every appearance of being a smoking gun. It’s here that Grimes and Sanni shared content with key Vote Leave directors, including campaign director Dominic Cummings, and Vote Leave’s data analytics firm, AIQ.\n\n“I looked at it and I thought ‘Oh, my God.’ That’s when I realised things were serious. I was, ‘OK, this is really fucked up.’”\n\nWhat Sanni realised was that on 17 March 2017, Victoria Woodcock, the chief operating officer of Vote Leave, went through the drive and deleted herself, Cummings and Vote Leave’s digital director, Henry de Zoete, from more than 100 files. However the system logged a record of her activity. It is not known whether or not she was acting under instruction.\n\nThis was 17 days after the Electoral Commission had written to Vote Leave and Darren Grimes, telling them that it was opening an investigation into the donation. And 13 days after the Observer had announced the Information Commissioner’s Office was launching an inquiry into the use of data in the referendum.\n\nTo Sanni it was obvious that something was seriously amiss – that this was evidence that had been deleted. Woodcock had painstakingly gone through the files one by one, and removed their names from them. Not one or two, but 140 of them. On a blog post published on Friday, Cummings says this is “factually wrong and libellous”. Vote Leave say staff acted “ethically, responsibly and legally in deleting any data”.\n\n“What did you do when you saw that on the drive?” I ask Sanni.\n\n“I told Chris,” he says.\n\nA gif showing changes made to BeLeave shared drive permissions on 17 March 2017.\n\nI’ve spent countless hours this year talking to Christopher Wylie, and it was through him that I first heard about Shahmir Sanni’s role in the EU referendum. Wylie is the whistleblower whose revelations in the Observer last weekend about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook precipitated such an astonishing global fallout. Cambridge Analytica’s CEO, Alexander Nix, has been suspended, while at one stage Facebook saw around $60bn wiped off its share price. On Wednesday, Mark Zuckerberg apologised.\n\nChristopher Wylie is not just at the heart of the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook scandal. He’s at the heart of Brexit too.\n\nIt was Wylie who introduced both Sanni and Grimes to Vote Leave. Politics is a small world, and Wylie’s work with the Lib Dems in the coalition government had brought him into contact with both Lib Dems and Tories. Grimes and Sanni were both friends of Wylie, and it was he who introduced them to Stephen Parkinson of Vote Leave. In a statement released this week, Stephen Parkinson said: “I was not introduced to Shahmir Sanni or Darren Grimes by Chris Wylie as he is claiming, but by a mutual friend from university.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Screenshot of a March 2016 email exchange between Shahmir Sanni and Vote Leave’s Stephen Parkinson. Beginning with the phrase “As Chris has already mentioned...”, Sanni asks about meeting to discuss the possibility of working with the Leave campaign. Photograph: Screenshot\n\nIt is Wylie’s role elsewhere that is pivotal. Because he didn’t just play a founding role in setting up Cambridge Analytica: he also helped in the setting up of AIQ, the Canadian data services and “digital advertising” firm to which Vote Leave allocated 40% of its £6.8m spend.\n\nIn February last year, I wrote my first report about Cambridge Analytica, interrogating what work it had done for Nigel Farage’s Leave.EU campaign. It kicked off two investigations into Cambridge Analytica’s role in Brexit: one by the Electoral Commission into its work for Leave.EU; the other by the ICO into how it used data. Since then, both organisations have denied that Cambridge Analytica did any paid or unpaid work for Leave.EU. However, on Friday, a former director of the data firm, Brittany Kaiser, said she was told to deny any work had been done. “In my opinion, I was lying,” she said. ”I felt like we should say ‘this is exactly what we did’.” This is consistent with what I have been reporting for more than a year.\n\nIn March, after the first article was published, I got a tip-off. Vote Leave – the official leave campaign group in the referendum – was entirely separate from Leave.EU, but the data analytics firm Vote Leave used, AIQ, was linked to SCL Elections, the parent company that set up Cambridge Analytica with Robert Mercer’s funds. AIQ was until last year listed on its website as “SCL Canada”.\n\nIt was my attempt to prove this, to figure out the link, that first led me to Wylie. “If you want to understand where Canada fits into this,” an ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica told me, “you need to find Christopher Wylie.” So I did.\n\nWylie was the key to understanding how Cambridge Analytica had harvested upwards of 50m Facebook profiles. And he was the key to understanding the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ.\n\n“I helped set up AIQ in 2013,” he told me in our first conversation. “They’re my friends. We needed someone to build Cambridge Analytica’s technology platform and manage their databases, and I asked my friend Jeff.”\n\nJeff Silvester was Wylie’s first employer, a man he had known since he was 16 and who went on to co-found AIQ. Last May, Wylie showed me a document that proved the link: an intellectual property agreement that showed SCL Elections owned AIQ’s IP “in perpetuity”. This document shows the link between Cambridge Analytica and AIQ. Between Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon and Brexit. What’s more, says Wylie, AIQ deployed the algorithms that Cambridge Analytica built. “AIQ managed Ripon, Cambridge Analytica’s platform, and built a lot of the tech to connect the algorithms to social and online advertising networks.” In response to our questions, AggregateIQ said: “AggregateIQ has always been 100 per cent Canadian owned and operated. AggregateIQ never worked or even communicated in anyway with Cambridge Analytica, or any other parties related to Cambridge Analytica, with respect to the Brexit campaign.”\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, almost all of AIQ’s work came via Cambridge Analytica. They worked closely with Cambridge Analytica’s vice-president, Steve Bannon, on multiple political campaigns in the US. “Bannon was always interested in Brexit,” says Wylie. “He saw Britain as a cultural leader. And where Britain led, America would follow.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An excerpt from the Electoral Commission’s November 2017 review of assessments into the “potential incorrect reporting of joint referendum spending”.\n\nIn total, £3.9m of leave campaign funds were spent with AIQ. Four different groups used the firm, even though all these campaigns were supposedly separate and could only “work together” if they shared their spending limits. Vote Leave spent £2,697,000. There was the £675,000 via BeLeave. A sum of £100,000 that Vote Leave donated to Veterans for Britain, which Veterans for Britain then paid to AIQ. AIQ also received £32,750 from the Democratic Unionist party. Whichever way one looks at it, AIQ would seem to be fundamental to the data-driven targeting of “persuadables” in the final days of the campaign.\n\nThese four campaign groups mysteriously and independently found the same tiny data analytics firm, located in a sleepy town on an island off the west coast of Canada, 5,000 miles away.\n\nIn April 2017, Dominic Cummings told me by email that Vote Leave had found the firm “on the internet”. Darren Grimes told the Electoral Commission the same thing. The only problem? Online archives show that AIQ’s website didn’t show up in Google searches until after the referendum. “I looked at the time,” says Sanni. “I was, like, ‘Who is AIQ?’ And there was nothing. No website. Nothing.”\n\nIt’s Cummings who is widely acknowledged to be the mastermind of Vote Leave. A close friend of Michael Gove, he had worked as his special adviser when Gove was minister of education, alongside another senior Vote Leave director, its head of digital, Henry de Zoete.\n\nNobody is in any doubt about Cummings’s brilliance: he’s advertised it widely, and written thousands of words about his strategy on his blog – about how he spent 98% of his budget online; how Vote Leave’s ads received nearly a billion impressions; and how, in the end, it came down to just 600,000 people, or just over 1% of registered votes. “A small enough margin,” he notes, that “a few specific events and decisions” made all the difference.\n\nHe’s also been very specific about the pivotal role played by AIQ. The firm’s website featured a quote from Cummings about Brexit: “We couldn’t have done it without them.” This was removed from the site this week. AIQ told the Observer that “the services it provided to Vote Leave were in accordance with instructions given by Vote Leave”, and “the services provided to BeLeave were in accordance given by BeLeave”.\n\nThe final weeks of the Brexit campaign were the most crucial. On his blog, Cummings says they code-named the period “Waterloo” and ramped up its spending, bombarding the small sliver of people it had identified as “persuadable” with every kind of ad. And it worked. Cummings’s campaign was a triumph. It had overcome all the odds. There’s no doubt that he won the war of the internet.\n\nBut the question about this donation, the £675,000 that went to Darren Grimes (to him personally because BeLeave was not a limited company), the four campaigns that all used AIQ, and AIQ’s links to Cambridge Analytica… all this has dogged the result for 18 months now.\n\nPlay Video 0:30 Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings: ‘We basically dumped the entire budget in the last 10 days’ – video\n\nLast autumn, Cummings took himself off Twitter. A freedom of information effort by Peter Geoghegan and Adam Ramsay of Open Democracy became the basis for a judicial review by the Good Law Project’s Jolyon Maugham QC, and in November, in what was front-page news, the Electoral Commission reopened its investigation into Darren Grimes and the donation. It had “reasonable grounds”, it said, “to suspect an offence may have been committed.”\n\nCummings masterminded Vote Leave’s strategy. And CEO Matthew Elliott signed it all off. But neither has been named by the Electoral Commission or the Information Commissioner’s Office in any of the multiple subsequent investigations. As Sanni points out, “It’s Darren’s name all over everything. He’s the one in the frame.” And he’s the one, according to Sanni, who has borne the brunt of the stress and anxiety that’s followed.\n\nThis is the heart of the story, and it’s what has ultimately prompted Shahmir Sanni to go on the record.\n\n“Darren is totally loyal,” he says. “And they knew that.”\n\nAnd it was witnessing the toll the investigation was taking on Grimes that finally made Sanni realise the seriousness of the charges.\n\n“It’s the impact on Darren’s health that made me go: ‘Something’s fucked up. Something’s wrong.’”\n\nIn evidence that Sanni has submitted to the Electoral Commission, he includes Facebook messages that Grimes sent him at the time senior Vote Leave staff were trying to arrange the donation; text messages that make poignant reading in the light of what happened next.”\n\nGrimes: “I was a bit worried about things going wrong tbh […] Especially with the prying eyes because of the expenses scandal.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Gove and Darren Grimes (back left) in BeLeave campaign material. Photograph: BeLeave\n\nSanni: “What are you worried about?”\n\nGrimes: “Managing accounts/handling that sum of money and making sure everything is properly accounted for I guess. I have a lot to manage pretty much alone because people are flakey [sic]. And the last thing I need is to end up fucking up. Haha.”\n\nSanni: “I don’t think you’ve got anything to worry about honestlyyt [sic]. And you’re worried because you care – which is good thing… And the fact that people are wiling to donate to BeLeave instead of Vote Leave is something you should be very, very proud of.”\n\nWhat’s more, in an email sent on 16 May to Vote Leave’s lawyer, Cleo Watson wrote: “… Darren and the rest of the group (all between 18 & 22) don’t feel comfortable handling the money side of things, having no experience beyond their student loans.”\n\nIt’s a stunning acknowledgment, one which raises more questions. This was Vote Leave’s senior director and Vote Leave’s head of compliance acknowledging that this was a group of young people without the experience or wherewithal to handle such a large sum of money. Watson told the Observer: “I absolutely deny the claims being levelled against me.” She said she was supportive as a friend but did not have “any kind of control” over them.\n\nThere’s a heartbreaking contrast in the documents that Sanni has – between the cynicism that informed the funding scheme and the idealism that underpinned BeLeave’s messages and beliefs (“BeLeave is a movement of young people working to build a bright future for Britain outside the European Union,” read the funding proposal document they submitted).\n\n‘I made Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool’: meet the data war whistleblower Read more\n\nAnd Grimes’s fear that somehow he would mess up and jeopardise the cause is unmistakable: that it was too much responsibility; that he didn’t feel up to it. Sanni repeatedly tells him, “you should be proud”, and Grimes replies: “I guess it is just worrying soemthing [sic] is gonna fuck up and it’ll be me having to pay thousands back and end up homeless.” We sent Darren Grimes a summary of the evidence we had found. He said any allegations he had done anything wrong were “damaging” and “untrue”.\n\nWhat has amazed me through all this is Sanni. When I met him in August, I didn’t think he’d come forward. I thought there was an outside chance he might leak me emails or documents, but I couldn’t see him going on record. He’s a Leaver: these are his friends and colleagues, they are people he looked up to.\n\n“Everyone associated with the campaign knew who Darren was,” he says. “Everybody congratulated us and knew what role we’d played. Michael Gove knew exactly how important we’d been. He’s a close friend of Dom Cummings. Of course he knew. Boris Johnson knew. Everybody knew.”\n\nAnd part of me worried about what would happen if he did go on the record. I worried that Christopher Wylie’s decision to come forward last week might over-influence Sanni. That he’d expose himself to risks he hadn’t properly thought through. That at just 24, he couldn’t really understand the possible consequences. But what I’ve learned about Sanni in the past few months is how tough-minded he is. Coming to terms with the idea that he had been gulled and compromised by the people he respected, for the cause that he loved, has been painful and difficult. It was a process of months. But since he decided to come forward, he’s been determined to do what he has no doubt is the right thing. His messages reveal how protective and supportive he’s been of Darren Grimes. They’re at the heart of his decision. But he has a sense of higher purpose too.\n\n“I think I respect British laws more than most British people do,” he says. “I feel I respect this country and love this country more than some people who have been born and bred here. Because I know and I’ve seen… the safety that it’s brought me and my family, my sisters and my mother as a woman, as women that have potential and are now living their best lives.”\n\nSanni doesn’t go into detail about what they went through in Pakistan, but at one point he tells me that he has “had a lot of trauma in my life”. Nobody is making him come forward. And when he talks about his mother and sisters and the freedom they now enjoy, the hairs rise on the back of my neck. And then he tells me about queueing. It starts as a riff, but then it becomes a speech. A mission statement.\n\n“This is the one country where no matter what is happening, people will stand in a line. People here, there is a core ethos of what it means to be British: to do it right. To wait your turn. To never cheat or lie your way to get to the front. It’s what it means to be British.”\n\nSanni would still vote Leave. He just wants to do it properly. “We don’t cheat,” he says. “We’re British.”\n\nWhat will you do on Monday, I ask him. He still works for the TaxPayers’ Alliance, co-founded by Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s CEO. He has no other form of income. He shrugs. “Go to work, I suppose. Wait and see what happens.”\n\nLike us all.\n\n• This article was amended on 29 March 2018 to clarify that although Shahmir Sanni works for TaxPayers’ Alliance as digital campaign manager, he does not work on pro-Brexit social media messaging.\n\n",

    "article_text": "Mark Zuckerberg kept his silence – then did little to assuage the anger in a week that laid bare the worst of Silicon Valley\n\nEvery story has a beginning. For me, the story of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook that has unfolded so spectacularly this past week began in a cafe in Holloway, north London, at the beginning of 2017.\n\nI was having a coffee with my colleague Carole Cadwalladr. She had recently written a series of articles that set out how certain Google search terms had been “hijacked by the alt-right”. In the course of that investigation she explained how she had come across another pattern of activity apparently linking the Trump and Leave.EU campaigns, one that appeared to involve the billionaire Robert Mercer, Steve Bannon – then of Breitbart – and a secretive British company called Cambridge Analytica. She laid out the elements of what she knew, and what she didn’t, testing her conviction that “there’s definitely something there”.\n\nIn the year and more since, Carole has painstakingly pieced together that story from its disparate and determinedly obstructive elements. She has done this in the face of much scepticism, a series of legal challenges and several attempts at intimidation (last summer the Leave.EU campaign posted a photoshopped video of her being beaten up and circulated it for days). Last weekend, however, the “something there” that Carole had intuited about the story, and its full implications for our democracy, came into proper focus.\n\nThe trajectory of what happened since is a case study in how complex truths stubbornly pieced together can eventually capture the wider imagination. The first act in this drama was a legal challenge by Facebook, an attempt to suppress Carole’s interview with the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie the day before it appeared. They must have known a little of what was coming.\n\nQuick guide The Observer Show Hide The Observer is the world's oldest Sunday newspaper, founded in 1791. It is published by Guardian News & Media and is editorially independent.\n\n\n\nThe Observer had made the decision to share the revelations with the New York Times and with Channel 4 News, to pool resources and broaden its reach. Even so, on Sunday morning some experienced commentators initially just shrugged. On his sofa, Andrew Marr felt he could pretty much ignore the story, dismissing it as “too complicated” to merit much attention. JK Rowling, meanwhile, suggested in a tweet that it was “surely the story of the year, if not the decade”. In the days that followed, the latter reaction has seemed closer to the mark.\n\nThis was partly down to one of the more memorable pieces of journalistic theatre. Rarely, in real time, can hypocrisy have been exposed so pointedly as on Monday night’s Channel 4 News. That afternoon, Alexander Nix, the self-possessed Etonian chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, had been plaintively professing his company’s rectitude to the BBC, and suggesting that he was the victim of a co-ordinated smear campaign. That evening, he and his managing director, Mark Turnbull, were shown explaining to undercover Channel 4 reporters exactly how they had manipulated the voters of democracies across the globe, notably in the US, with unsourced propaganda that was not necessarily true; and boasting of sting operations and honey traps\n\nIn a way, that was only the warm-up act of the story. Nix’s unwitting confessions were in marked contrast to the silence from Facebook’s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg. All anyone knew of Facebook’s response on Monday was that it had a swat team of data analysts working overnight at Cambridge Analytica’s offices – though that same data remained out of bounds for the government’s information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, who was trying in vain to get a warrant to access files before they were potentially compromised. Zuckerberg declined to face his own employees at a meeting on Tuesday, while again a press statement from his PR team suggested that “the entire company is outraged we were deceived”. The continued silence seemed to tell another story, however, not least to Wall Street; in those two days nearly $60bn was wiped off the Facebook market capitalisation, and #whereszuck became a top-trending social media meme.\n\nAs the silence persisted, a little of Zuckerberg’s public relations dilemma became clear. The original legal threat to the Observer was over the question of whether the 50 million profiles handed first to the Cambridge academic Aleksandr Kogan and then sold on to Cambridge Analytica constituted a data breach. Facebook insisted that it did not, but that insistence itself amounted to a public acknowledgement of a business model that appeared to allow the unauthorised sale of private data.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg did eventually come out to try to explain this, his crafted statement was another effort to make the exploitation of the 50 million profiles seem like a technical problem, a glitch. His tone was the default position of T-shirted Silicon Valley plutocrats who insist that they are on our side, while squirrelling away their billions. What had happened was not a data breach “but a breach of trust”, he suggested, a sentiment he repeats in a personal advertisement in today’s newspapers, including the Observer.\n\nThis appeal to Facebook users’ faith in its better nature recalled an infamous recorded exchange from the early days of Facebook at Harvard, when Zuckerberg was in conversation with a friend.\n\nZuck: “Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard, just ask. I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS.”\n\nFriend: “What? How’d you manage that one?”\n\nZuck: “People just submitted it. I don’t know why. They ‘trust me’. Dumb fucks!”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix (right) talking about his company’s role in the US presidential election to an undercover reporter for Channel 4 News. Photograph: Channel 4 News/PA\n\nPeople closest to the beneficiaries of Cambridge Analytica’s work have been quickest to suggest that it was negligible. Though Cambridge Analytica’s own claims suggest that its tens of thousands of propaganda items were viewed billions of times, Steve Bannon suggested the effect was insignificant: people have minds of their own and are not swayed by what they see and hear on the internet, the argument goes.\n\nTo counter this, you don’t really have to point out that we live in a world where a significant percentage of people now believe that the Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax perpetrated by actors, or that sharia law is about to take hold in the home counties, you just have to point to the history of advertising.\n\nPropaganda works best, as Cambridge Analytica’s Mark Turnbull helpfully pointed out to camera, when you do not know its source. He excitedly detailed the way in which extremist views and fake news could be “seeded” in the bloodstream of social media and then take hold. Facebook in particular has, in this respect, delivered what propagandists have always wanted, a complete blurring of the line – still sacrosanct in traditional media – between editorial and advertising, often delivered with the added reliability of having been “shared” by a “friend”.\n\nAs David Kirkpatrick, Facebook’s authorised biographer, noted, one characteristic of the first eight years of the company was a tendency for Zuckerberg and his inner circle to sit around and try to establish exactly what business they were in.\n\nEarly on, Zuckerberg liked to refer to his creation as “a directory of people” in these discussions; later he came to focus on “connectivity”. A more cynical response to that question has always been that they were in the advertising business, but as the writer John Lanchester pointed out, even that doesn’t really get to the truth. “Even more than it is in the advertising business, Facebook is in the surveillance business.” It is designed to watch our every move, our every like and dislike, and sell those findings to the highest bidder.\n\nFor the majority of the 2.1 billion users of Facebook up until now, that has seemed like a price worth paying, in order to connect with friends and family. The wisdom promoted by the tech companies to their users is that privacy is only for those with something to hide. What the Cambridge Analytica story has begun to reveal about those companies’ use of our intimate history of likes and dislikes, of private messages and personal photos, is that they cannot only be used to target us with holidays and theatre tickets, but also to shape our news of the world, and our political ideas, in ways we don’t recognise.\n\nThat understanding has, it seems, now reached something of a tipping point.\n\nImmediate ramifications of the exposé will see the prime movers in this story called to clarify previous statements to government committees on both sides of the Atlantic. Beyond that, last week may prove an important step in a long reckoning over whether monopolistic global corporations are best trusted with so much marketable personal data to exploit for personal gain.\n\nThe great rupture of the industrial revolution led eventually to the growth of trade unions and a new balance of power between capital and producer. The sheer pace of change of the digital revolution in our century has meant that the equivalent rebalancing is critically overdue. Last week even the Economist was persuaded of the need for Facebook in particular to make radical changes to its data practices, or for governments to call time on its model. “If Facebook ends up as a regulated utility with its returns on capital capped, its earnings may drop by 80%. How would you like that, Mr Zuckerberg?”\n\nWhen faced with the often anonymised global entity of the internet, it has been easy to buy the argument that the forces at work in it are too opaque and complex to hold to account. What the Cambridge Analytica revelations bring to light – through old-fashioned journalistic persistence – is that those forces are, in fact, open to the same kinds of manipulation and corruption that any media needs protection from, but on a far greater scale. The story has given the growing unease about the unaccountable empire-building of Silicon Valley tech companies an all-too-human set of faces. It may not be a pretty sight, but it is not one that will be easily forgotten.\n\nThe Observer’s story last week on the use of Facebook data by Cambridge Analytica sparked a worldwide response:\n\n“This is a serious moment for the web’s future. But I want us to remain hopeful.”\n\nTim Berners-Lee, world wide web inventor\n\n“[Facebook] has been misleading in its evidence to a British parliamentarycommittee, arrogant in its instinct to shirk the responsibilities that come with power.”\n\nThe Times\n\n“It is absolutely right the information commissioner is investigating … we expect all the organisations involved to cooperate…” Brian Acton, WhatsApp\n\n“We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can’t then we don’t deserve to serve you … We also made mistakes.”\n\nMark Zuckerberg\n\nWhat is disturbing is that Facebook has not yet identified and alerted users whose profile information was vacuumed up\n\nNew York Times\n\nThere are a number of inconsistencies in your evidence...

    "article_text": "The blueprint for how Cambridge Analytica claimed to have won the White House for Donald Trump by using Google, Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube is revealed for the first time in an internal company document obtained by the Guardian.\n\nThe 27-page presentation was produced by the Cambridge Analytica officials who worked most closely on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nA former employee explained to the Guardian how it details the techniques used by the Trump campaign to micro-target US voters with carefully tailored messages about the Republican nominee across digital channels.\n\nPlay Video 6:03 Brittany Kaiser, former Cambridge Analytica director: 'I voted for Bernie' - video\n\nIntensive survey research, data modelling and performance-optimising algorithms were used to target 10,000 different ads to different audiences in the months leading up to the election. The ads were viewed billions of times, according to the presentation.\n\nThe document was presented to Cambridge Analytica employees in London, New York and Washington DC weeks after Trump’s victory, providing an insight into how the controversial firm helped pull off one of the most dramatic political upsets in modern history.\n\n“This is the debrief of the data-driven digital campaign that was employed for Mr Trump,” said Brittany Kaiser, 30, who was Cambridge Analytica’s business development director until two weeks ago, when she left over a contractual dispute.\n\nShe is the second former employee to come forward in less than a week, talking exclusively to the Guardian about the inner workings of the firm, including the work she said it conducted on the UK’s EU membership referendum.\n\nShe said she had access to a copy of the same document now obtained by the Guardian, and had used it to showcase the campaign’s secret methods to potential clients of Cambridge Analytica.\n\n“There was a huge demand internally for people to see how we did it,” Kaiser said of the 2016 race. “Everyone wanted to know: past clients, future clients. The whole world wanted to see it. This is what we were allowed to confidentially show people if they signed a non-disclosure agreement.”\n\nKaiser claims to be committed to human rights, but many would argue her career at Cambridge Analytica tells a different story. She has worked extensively for the firm, pitching business to clients in countries that have a history of exploitation by western political mercenaries, including Lithuania, Benin, Ethiopia and Libya.\n\nCambridge Analytica has a reputation among political operatives for exaggerating its role in campaigns. A senior Trump campaign official who said they saw the document about a year ago claimed it took credit for some work that was done by the Republican national committee and Trump’s digital director, Brad Parscale.\n\nKaiser did not work on the campaign but said she gleaned information about how it was orchestrated during discussions with senior staff, including the now suspended chief executive, Alexander Nix.\n\nNone of the techniques described in the document are illegal. However, the scandal over Cambridge Analytica’s acquisition of data from more than 50 million Facebook users is lifting the lid on an industry that has learned how to closely track the online footprint and daily lives of US voters.\n\nDespite the advances made in data-led political campaigning, these were techniques that, according to the presentation, Trump did not have access to when Cambridge Analytica joined his campaign in early June 2016.\n\nThe Republican nominee, who had just secured sufficient delegates to become the party’s candidate, still had “no speakable data infrastructure” and “no unifying data, digital and tech strategy”, the document states.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A sample of Cambridge Analytica’s ‘Trump for President’ debrief. Photograph: Cambridge Analytica\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Cambridge Analytica\n\nKaiser said Cambridge Analytica staff told her they were stunned when they arrived at Trump’s headquarters in Trump Tower, New York.\n\n\n\n“There was no database of record. There were many disparate data sources that were not connected, matched or hygiened,” she said of the process of ordering, sorting and cleaning enormous data sets. “There was no data science programme, so they weren’t undertaking any modelling. There was no digital marketing team.”\n\nOne of the first things Cambridge Analytica did, she said, was work with data supplied by the party’s data trust and other data acquired through an initiative called Project Alamo.\n\nThe document contains very little information about how the campaign used Facebook data. One page, however, suggests Cambridge Analytica was able to constantly monitor the effectiveness of its messaging on different types of voters, giving the company and the campaign constant feedback about levels of engagement on platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Cambridge Analytica\n\nThe feedback loop meant the algorithms could be constantly updated and improved to deliver thousands of different messages to voters depending on their profile.\n\nThe level of information the company could glean about voters – and the apparent appetite among Silicon Valley companies to cash in on the advertising bonanza – is illustrated on another page which shows how the Trump campaign used a prime piece of marketing real estate on election day: YouTube’s entire masthead.\n\nCambridge Analytica scandal: the biggest revelations so far Read more\n\nKaiser said Hillary Clinton’s campaign had reserved the space on Google’s video-hosting platform but was so confident of victory that it gave it up. “Google called us and said this ad space is now available, immediately,” Kaiser said. “That’s what I was told.”\n\nThe Trump campaign seized the opportunity, showing two different ads to different categories of voters according to the detailed geographical information of visitors to the YouTube home page.\n\nVoters in areas where people were likely to be Trump supporters were shown a triumphant-looking image of the nominee, and help finding their nearest polling station.\n\nThose whose geographical information suggested they were not fervent Trump supporters, such as swing voters, were shown photos of his high-profile supporters, including his daughter Ivanka Trump, a celebrity from the reality TV show Duck Dynasty, and Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Cambridge Analytica\n\nOne of the most effective ads, according to Kaiser, was a piece of native advertising on the political news website Politico, which was also profiled in the presentation. The interactive graphic, which looked like a piece of journalism and purported to list “10 inconvenient truths about the Clinton Foundation”, appeared for several weeks to people from a list of key swing states when they visited the site. It was produced by the in-house Politico team that creates sponsored content.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica presentation dedicates an entire slide to the ad, which is described as having achieved “an average engagement time of four minutes”. Kaiser described the ad as “the most successful thing we pushed out”.\n\nPolitico said editorial journalists were not involved in the campaign, and similar ads were purchased by the Bernie Sanders and Clinton campaigns.\n\nAdvertisements on Facebook, Twitter, Google and the music-sharing app Pandora were used to help convince 35,000 supporters to install an app used by the most active supporters.\n\nAccording to the presentation, Cambridge Analytica and the Trump campaign also used a new advertising technique offered by Twitter, launched at the start of the election year, which enabled clients to kickstart viral tweets.\n\nThe “conversational ads” feature was used to encourage Trump’s followers to tweet using a set of pre-determined hashtags.\n\nThe campaign also took advantage of an ad opportunity provided by Snapchat, enabling users to swipe up and immediately see a preloaded web page. While not useful for securing donors, Cambridge Analytica deemed the tool useful for engaging potential voter “contacts”, according to the presentation.\n\nOne of the final slides explains how the company used paid-for Google ads to implement “persuasion search advertising”, to push pro-Trump and anti-Clinton search results through the company’s main search facility.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Cambridge Analytica\n\nOne slide showed how the company ensured that voters searching the words “Trump Iraq War” would encounter paid-for search results that were favourable to his campaign. “Control The First Impression,” the slide says, with an arrow pointing to a search result that states: “Hillary Voted for the Iraq War – Donald Trump opposed it.”\n\n“That’s a Google manipulation thing,” Kaiser said, adding that while a “general person” probably did not know how easy it was to pay for ads to appear high in Google search results, it was considered “an old-school tactic” in her industry.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Protecting the privacy of law-abiding citizens from the government is a pillar of Ted Cruz's Republican presidential candidacy, but his campaign is testing the limits of siphoning personal data from supporters.\n\nHis \"Cruz Crew\" mobile app is designed to gather detailed information from its users' phones — tracking their physical movements and mining the names and contact information for friends who might want nothing to do with his campaign.\n\nThat information and more is then fed into a vast database containing details about nearly every adult in the United States to build psychological profiles that target individual voters with uncanny accuracy.\n\nCruz's sophisticated analytics operation was heralded as key to his victory in Iowa earlier this month — the first proof, his campaign said, that the system has the potential to power him to the nomination.\n\nAfter finishing a distant third in New Hampshire, Cruz is looking to boost the turnout of likely supporters in South Carolina and in Southern states with primaries on March 1, where voters are more evangelical and conservative.\n\nThe son of mathematicians and data processing programmers, Cruz is keenly and personally interested in the work.\n\n\"Analytics gives the campaign a roadmap for everything we do,\" said Chris Wilson, data and digital director. \"He has an acute understanding of our work and continually pushes me on it.\"\n\nData-mining to help candidates win elections has been increasing among both Republicans and Democrats. Mobile apps by other presidential campaigns also collect some information about users.\n\nBut The Associated Press found the Cruz campaign's app — downloaded to more than 61,000 devices so far — goes furthest to glean personal data.\n\nThe Cruz app prompts supporters to register using their Facebook logins, giving the campaign access to personal information such as name, age range, gender, location and photograph, plus lists of friends and relatives. Those without a Facebook account must either provide an email address or phone number to use the app.\n\nBy contrast, the app offered by GOP candidate Ben Carson's campaign asks supporters to surrender the same information as Cruz from their Facebook accounts, but also gives an option to use it without providing any personal information. Carson's app separately asks users to let the campaign track their movements and asks them to voluntarily supply their birthdate and gender — including options for \"male,\" ''female\" and \"other.\"\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich's campaign app doesn't request personal information from supporters, but it repeatedly nags users to let the campaign track their movements until they answer yes.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Bernie Sanders' app, \"Field the Bern,\" requires supporters to sign in using their Facebook account or an email address, and it also repeatedly asks to let the campaign track their movements until they answer yes.\n\nThe other 2016 presidential contenders, including Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, appear not to have officially sanctioned campaign apps in Apple and Android stores.\n\nThe Cruz app separately urges users to let it download their phone contacts, giving the campaign a trove of phone numbers and personal email addresses. The campaign says that by using its app, \"You hereby give your express consent to access your contact list,\" but Wilson said the campaign will not do this to anyone who declines to allow it when the app requests permission.\n\nCruz's app also transmits to the campaign each user's physical location whenever the app is active, unless a user declines to allow it. The campaign said it does this \"so that we can connect you to other Cruz Crew users based on your particular geographic location.\"\n\nThe campaign tells users it can share all the personal information it collects with its consultants or other organizations, groups, causes, campaigns or political organizations with similar viewpoints or goals.\n\nIt also shares the material with analytics companies. Cruz's campaign combines the information with data from a group called Cambridge Analytica, which has been involved in his efforts since fall 2014. A Cambridge investor, Robert Mercer, has given more money than anyone else to outside groups supporting Cruz.\n\nSanders' campaign said it shares personal information from supporters with its consultants and vendors but not analytics companies.\n\nCambridge has a massive 10 terabyte database — enough to fill more than 2,100 DVDs — that contains as many as 5,000 biographical details about the 240 million Americans of voting age. Cambridge considers its methodology highly secretive, but it may include such details as household income, employment status, credit history, party affiliation, church membership and spending habits. Cambridge uses powerful computers and proprietary algorithms to predict Americans' personality traits.\n\nThe Cruz campaign paid Cambridge $3.8 million in 2015, accounting for more than 8 percent of all its spending. Two outside groups supporting Cruz, including one directly funded by $11 million from Mercer, paid the firm $682,000 since December. Cambridge has five employees at Cruz headquarters in Houston and 70 others split between New York City and the Washington suburbs.\n\nThe power of Cruz's data-driven systems was on display in Iowa.\n\nThe GOP candidates held similar positions on issues such as abortion and gun control. Cambridge helped differentiate Cruz by identifying automated red light cameras as an issue of importance to Iowa residents upset with government intrusion. Potential voters living near the red light cameras were sent direct messages saying Cruz was against their use.\n\n\"Everything in this campaign is data-driven. I've never seen anything like it,\" said Jerry Sickles, a paid field representative in Hooksett, New Hampshire, who uses the Cruz Crew app. \"We just know exactly who our voters are, and we will make sure they get out to vote.\"\n\nCruz, the junior senator from Texas, has been outspoken about protecting Americans' personal information from the government, including the National Security Agency. \"Instead of a government that seizes your emails and your cellphones, imagine a federal government that protected the privacy rights of every American,\" he said when announcing his campaign.\n\nCruz campaign officials say it's different for the government versus a campaign to collect data. Sickle said Cruz is building on the use of big data pioneered by the successful Democratic campaigns of Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012.\n\n\"It's not like we're giving it to the NSA,\" Sickle said.\n\nA campaign spokeswoman, Alice Stewart, added: \"Why wouldn't we want to use every tool available to us to win?\"\n\nThe scope of Cruz's system is formidable. Cambridge's database combines government and commercial data sets such as voter rolls and lists of people who liked certain Facebook posts, along with consumer data from grocery chains and other clients that can provide a voter's preferred brand of toothpaste or whether he clips coupons. In Iowa, where identifying evangelical voters was key to Cruz's victory strategy, Cambridge's employees scoured the Internet for such useful information as church membership rolls.\n\nCambridge CEO Alexander Nix said the company categorizes every American into one of five basic personality types derived from academic research and up to 50,000 questionnaires conducted each month.\n\n\"We've quantified the personalities of every adult American,\" Nix said. \"We can reach out and target those different clusters with messages about the things they care about most, but that have been nuanced to resonate with their personality type.\"\n\nFor example, a Cruz campaign worker about to knock on the door of a house would access information about the household's members through the Cruz Crew app, receiving prepared scripts about what issues each person was likely to care about, modified to appeal to their personality.\n\nEven within issues such as the right to bear arms, Nix said personality types will tailor the message. For voters who care about traditions or family, a message may resonate about guaranteeing the ability of a grandfather teaching shooting lessons. For someone identified as introverted, a better pitch might describe keeping guns for protection against crime.\n\nCambridge and the Cruz campaign stressed that anyone providing personal information through the app does so voluntarily. Data uses are outlined in legal disclosures available on the campaign's website.\n\nCambridge said it operates behind firewalls on its computer servers to secure its data and follows all applicable U.S. laws. Cambridge runs its operations out of the U.S.; they would be illegal in Europe under stricter privacy laws there.\n\nIn the hours before the Iowa vote, the campaign pushed urgent messages through its app to users who had Iowa contacts listed in their phones. The app displayed pre-written text messages the supporters were encouraged to forward to their Iowa acquaintances, urging them to caucus for Cruz.\n\nThe chief technologist at the privacy advocacy group Center for Democracy and Technology, Joe Hall, said politicians are unlikely to strengthen privacy protections as their campaigns become more and more reliant on mining personal data to squeeze out votes.\n\n\"This is a form of political-voter surveillance,\" Hall said. \"If people understood that this amount of fine-grained, sensitive data was being used by political campaigns, they would likely feel betrayed.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Michael Biesecker on Twitter at https://twitter.com/mbieseck and Julie Bykowicz at http://twitter.com/bykowicz",

As the report went on air, the firm announced it has suspended chief executive Alexander Nix, pending a full investigation.\n\nAn undercover investigation by Channel 4 News has revealed how Cambridge Analytica claims it ran key parts of the presidential campaign for Donald Trump.\n\nThe British data company was secretly filmed discussing coordination between Trump’s campaign and outside groups – an activity which is potentially illegal.\n\nExecutives claimed they “ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy” for President Trump.\n\nIn the third part of a Channel 4 News investigation into Cambridge Analytica, bosses also talked about:\n\nThe full scale of their pivotal work in Trump’s election win\n\nHow they avoid Congressional investigations into their foreign clients\n\nSetting up proxy organisations to feed untraceable messages onto social media\n\nUsing a secret email system where messages self-destruct and leave no trace\n\nCambridge Analytica’s involvement in the “Defeat Crooked Hilary” brand of attack ads\n\nIn a series of meetings filmed at London hotels over four months, between November 2017 and January 2018 an undercover reporter for Channel 4 News posed as a fixer for a wealthy client hoping to get candidates elected in Sri Lanka.\n\nUPDATE: Cambridge Analytica have announced they have suspended chief executive Alexander Nix pending a full investigation. They said: “In the view of the board Mr Nix’s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 News do not represent the values or operations of the firm.”\n\n‘We ran all the digital campaign’\n\nThe company says their work with data and research allowed Mr Trump to win with a narrow margin of “40,000 votes” in three states providing victory in the electoral college system, despite losing the popular vote by more than 3 million votes.\n\nThe election was plagued by allegations of fake news and smears on social media, along with the alleged attempt by Russia to influence the outcome.\n\nMr Nix boasted about Cambridge Analytica’s work for Trump, saying: “We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.”\n\nSeparately, Mr Turnbull described how the company could create proxy organisations to discreetly feed negative material about opposition candidates on to the Internet and social media.\n\nHe said: “Sometimes you can use proxy organisations who are already there. You feed them. They are civil society organisations.. Charities or activist groups, and we use them – feed them the material and they do the work…\n\n“We just put information into the bloodstream to the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape. And so this stuff infiltrates the online community and expands but with no branding – so it’s unattributable, untrackable.”\n\nCambridge Analytica’s senior executives were also filmed discussing a twin-track strategy to campaigning, putting out positive messages through the official Donald J Trump for President campaign, while negative material was pushed out through outside organisations.\n\nCambridge Analytica’s chief data scientist Dr Tayler said: “As part of it, sometimes you have to separate it from the political campaign itself. So in America you know there are independent expenditure groups running behind the campaign… Super pacs. Political action committees.\n\n“So, campaigns are normally subject to limits about how much money they can raise. Whereas outside groups can raise an unlimited amount. So the campaign will use their finite resources for things like persuasion and mobilisation and then they leave the ‘air war’ they call it, like the negative attack ads to other affiliated groups.”\n\nIn a different meeting, Mr Turnbull described how the company created the “Defeat Crooked Hilary” brand of attack ads, that were funded by the Make America Number 1 super-PAC and watched more than 30 million times during the campaign.\n\nCoordination between an official election campaign and any outside groups is illegal under US election law. Cambridge Analytica deny wrongdoing, insisting a strict firewall separated out their activity and that they were transparent about their work on political campaigns and PACs.\n\n‘No paper trail’\n\nIn one exchange Alexander Nix revealed the company used a secret self-destructing email system that leaves no trace. He said: “No-one knows we have it, and secondly we set our… emails with a self-destruct timer… So you send them and after they’ve been read, two hours later, they disappear. There’s no evidence, there’s no paper trail, there’s nothing.”\n\nMr Nix also belittled representatives on the House Intelligence Committee to whom he gave evidence in 2017. He claims Republican members asked just three questions. “After five minutes – done.”\n\n“They’re politicians, they’re not technical. They don’t understand how it works,” he said.\n\nMr Nix further claimed that Democrats on the Committee are motivated by “sour grapes”.\n\nHe said: “They don’t understand because the candidate never, is never involved. He’s told what to do by the campaign team.”\n\n“So the candidate is the puppet?,” the undercover reporter asked.\n\n“Always,” replied Mr Nix.\n\nHe added that his firm could avoid any US investigation into its foreign clients. “I’m absolutely convinced that they have no jurisdiction…,” he said. “We’ll say none of your business.”\n\nThe meetings involved Mr Nix, along with Mark Turnbull, Managing Director Political Global, and Dr Alex Tayler, the company’s chief data scientist.\n\n‘Very disturbing’\n\nDefeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has told Channel 4 News how she faced a “massive propaganda effort” during the election – and questioned if Cambridge Analytica helped the Russians in their alleged attempt to influence the election outcome.\n\nIn an exclusive interview filmed in October 2017 to promote her book, she said: “There was a new kind of campaign that was being run on the other side – that nobody had ever faced before. Because it wasn’t just all about me. It was about how to suppress voters who were inclined to vote for me.\n\n“When you have a massive propaganda effort to prevent people from thinking straight, because they’re being flooded with false information and you have people who are searching.. trying to make sense of it. But every search engine, every site they go into is repeating these fabrications. Then yes It affected the thought processes of voters.”\n\nThe former candidate also questioned whether Cambridge Analytica were involved in the Russia’s alleged attempt to influence the election, calling the possibility “very disturbing”.\n\nCambridge Analytica strongly deny any involvement and say any such allegation is false.\n\nClinton said: “So you’ve got CA, you’ve got the Republican National Committee which of course has always done data collection and analysis and you’ve got the Russians. And the real question is how did the Russians know how to target their messages so precisely to undecided voters in Wisconsin or Michigan or Pennsylvania – that is really the nub of the question.\n\n“So if they were getting advice from say Cambridge Analytica or someone else about OK here are the 12 voters in this town in Wisconsin – that’s whose Facebook pages you need to be on to send these messages that indeed would be very disturbing.”\n\n‘Absurd’ allegations\n\nTonight, a Cambridge Analytica spokesman said: “CA has never claimed it won the election for President Trump. This is patently absurd. We are proud of the work we did on that campaign, and have spoken in many public forums about what we consider to be our contribution to the campaign.”\n\nOn campaign finance violations, the firm said: “Cambridge Analytica has been completely transparent about our simultaneous work on both political campaigns and political action committees (including publicly declaring our work on both with FEC filings). We have strict firewall practises to ensure no coordination between regulated groups, including the teams working on non-coordinated campaigns being physically separated, using different servers and being banned from communicating with each other.”\n\nOn Russia investigation: “As one of the companies that played a prominent role in the 2016 election campaign, Cambridge Analytica is committed to supporting and assisting the House Intelligence Committee investigation into Russian interference in the election in any way that we can. CA is not under investigation, and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the company. They deny any involvement in the alleged Russian attempts and say such an allegation is entirely false.”\n\nAnd on ProtonMail, Cambridge Analytica said: “It’s common practice to use encrypted communications. We take information security with the utmost seriousness, and for high profile clients using maintain stream email providers simply doesn’t provide a suitable level of security.”",

    "article_text": "Political data gathered on more than 198 million US citizens was exposed this month after a marketing firm contracted by the Republican National Committee stored internal documents on a publicly accessible Amazon server.\n\nThe data leak contains a wealth of personal information on roughly 61 percent of the US population. Along with home addresses, birthdates, and phone numbers, the records include advanced sentiment analyses used by political groups to predict where individual voters fall on hot-button issues such as gun ownership, stem cell research, and the right to abortion, as well as suspected religious affiliation and ethnicity. The data was amassed from a variety of sources—from the banned subreddit r/fatpeoplehate to American Crossroads, the super PAC co-founded by former White House strategist Karl Rove.\n\nDeep Root Analytics, a conservative data firm that identifies audiences for political ads, confirmed ownership of the data to Gizmodo on Friday.\n\nUpGuard cyber risk analyst Chris Vickery discovered Deep Root’s data online last week. More than a terabyte was stored on the cloud server without the protection of a password and could be accessed by anyone who found the URL. Many of the files did not originate at Deep Root, but are instead the aggregate of outside data firms and Republican super PACs, shedding light onto the increasingly advanced data ecosystem that helped propel President Donald Trump’s slim margins in key swing states.\n\nAlthough files possessed by Deep Root would be typical in any campaign, Republican or Democratic, experts say its exposure in a single open database raises significant privacy concerns. “This is valuable for people who have nefarious purposes,” Joseph Lorenzo Hall, the chief technologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said of the data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“This is valuable for people who have nefarious purposes.”\n\nThe RNC paid Deep Root $983,000 last year, according to Federal Election Commission reports, but its server contained records from a variety of other conservative sources paid millions more, including The Data Trust (also known as GOP Data Trust), the Republican party’s primary voter file provider. Data Trust received over $6.7 million from the RNC during the 2016 cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org, and its president, Johnny DeStefano, now serves as Trump’s director of presidential personnel.\n\nThe Koch brothers’ political group Americans for Prosperity, which had a data-swapping agreement with Data Trust during the 2016 election cycle, contributed heavily to the exposed files, as did the market research firm TargetPoint, whose co-founder previously served as director of Mitt Romney’s strategy team. (The Koch brothers also subsidized a data company known as i360, which began exchanging voter files with Data Trust in 2014.) Furthermore, the files provided by Rove’s American Crossroads contain strategic voter data used to target, among others, disaffected Democrats and undecideds in Nevada, New Hampshire, Ohio, and other key battleground states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeep Root further obtained hundreds of files (at least) from The Kantar Group, a leading media and market research company with offices in New York, Beijing, Moscow, and more than a hundred other cities on six continents. Each file offers rich details about political ads—estimated cost, audience demographics, reach, and more—by and about figures and groups spanning the political spectrum. There are files on the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Planned Parenthood, and the American Civil Liberties Union, as well as files on every 2016 presidential candidate, Republicans included.\n\nWhat’s more, the Kantar files each contain video links to related political ads stored on Kantar’s servers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpreadsheets acquired from TargetPoint, which partnered with Deep Root and GOP Data Trust during the 2016 election, include the home addresses, birthdates, and party affiliations of nearly 200 million registered voters in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections, as well as some 2016 voters. TargetPoint’s data seeks to resolve questions about where individual voters stand on dozens of political issues. For example: Is the voter eco-friendly? Do they favor lowering taxes? Do they believe the Democrats should stand up to Trump? Do they agree with Trump’s “America First” economic stance? Pharmaceutical companies do great damage: Agree or Disagree?\n\nThe details of voters’ likely preferences for issues like stem cell research and gun control were likely drawn from a variety of sources according to a Democratic strategist who spoke with Gizmodo.\n\n“Data like that would be a combination of polling data, real world data from door-knocking and phone-calling and other canvassing activities, coupled with modeling using the data we already have to extrapolate what the voters we don’t know about would think,” the strategist said. “The campaigns that do it right combine all the available data together to make the most robust model for every single voter in the target universe.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We take full responsibility for this situation.”\n\nIn a statement, Deep Root founder Alex Lundry told Gizmodo, “We take full responsibility for this situation.” He said the data included proprietary information as well as publicly available voter data provided by state government officials. “Since this event has come to our attention, we have updated the access settings and put protocols in place to prevent further access,” Lundry said.\n\nDeep Root’s data was exposed after the company updated its security settings on June 1, Lundry said. Deep Root has retained Stroz Friedberg, a cybersecurity and digital forensics firm, to investigate. “Based on the information we have gathered thus far, we do not believe that our systems have been hacked,” Lundry added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo far, Deep Root doesn’t believe its proprietary data was accessed by any malicious third parties during the 12 days that the data was exposed on the open web.\n\nDeep Root’s server was discovered by UpGuard’s Vickery on the night of June 12 as he was searching for data publicly accessible on Amazon’s cloud service. He used the same process last month to detect sensitive files tied to a US Defense Department project and exposed by an employee of a top defense contractor.\n\nThis is not the first leak of voter files uncovered by Vickery, who told Gizmodo that he was alarmed over how the data was apparently being used—some states, for instance, prohibit the commercial use of voter records. Moreover, it was not immediately clear to whom the data belonged. “It was decided that law enforcement should be contacted before attempting any contact with the entity responsible,” said Vickery, who reported that the server was secured two days later on June 14.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA web of data firms funnel research into campaigns\n\nDeep Root’s data sheds light onto the increasingly sophisticated data operation that has fed recent Republican campaigns and lays bare the intricate network of political organizations, PACs, and analysis firms that trade in bulk voter data. In an email to Gizmodo, Deep Root said that its voter models are used to enhance the understanding of TV viewership for political ad buyers. “The data accessed was not built for or used by any specific client,” Lundry said. “It is our proprietary analysis to help inform local television ad buying.”\n\nHowever, the presence of data on the server from several political organizations, including TargetPoint and Data Trust, suggests that it was used for Republican political campaigns. Deep Root also works primarily with GOP customers (although similar vendors, such as NationBuilder, service the Democrats as well).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeep Root is one of three data firms hired by the Republican National Committee in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Founded by Lundry, a data scientist on the Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney campaigns, the firm was one of three analytics teams that worked on the Trump campaign following the party’s national convention in the summer of 2016.\n\nLundry’s work brought him into Trump’s campaign war room, according to a post-election AdAge article that charted the GOP’s 2016 data efforts. Deep Root was hand-picked by the RNC’s then-chief of staff, Katie Walsh, in September of last year and joined two other data shops—TargetPoint Consulting and Causeway Solutions—in the effort to win Trump the presidency.\n\nWalsh, who now works for the nonprofit America First Policies after a brief stint in the White House, oversaw Trump’s data operation in partnership with Brad Parscale, Trump’s digital director. (Parscale did not respond to a request for comment before press time. Attempts to reach Walsh for comment were also unsuccessful.) Walsh and Parscale focused their efforts on three categories of voters, AdAge reports: voters who might be predisposed to support Trump, Republican voters who were uncertain about Trump, and voters that were leaning toward Hillary Clinton but could be persuaded by Trump’s message of changing up government-as-usual.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo appeal to the three crucial categories, it appears that Trump’s team relied on voter data provided by Data Trust. Complete voter rolls for 2008 and 2012, as well as partial 2016 voter rolls for Florida and Ohio, apparently compiled by Data Trust are contained in the dataset exposed by Deep Root.\n\nData Trust acquires voter rolls from state officials and then standardizes the voter data to create a clean, manageable record of all registered US voters, a source familiar with the firm’s operations told Gizmodo. Voter data itself is public record and therefore not particularly sensitive, the source added, but the tools Data Trust uses to standardize that data are considered proprietary. That data is then provided to political clients, including analytics firms like Deep Root. While Data Trust requires its clients to protect the data, it has to take clients at their word that industry-standard encryption and security protocols are in place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTargetPoint and Causeway, the two firms employed by the RNC in addition to Deep Root, apparently layered their own analytics atop the information provided by Data Trust. TargetPoint conducted thousands of surveys per week in 22 states, according to AdAge, gauging voter sentiment on a variety of topics. While Causeway helped manage the data, Deep Root used it to perfect its TV advertising targets—producing voter turnout estimates by county and using that intelligence to target its ad buys.\n\n\n\nA source with years of experience working on political campaign data operations told Gizmodo that the data exposed by Deep Root appeared to be customized for the RNC and had apparently been used to create models for turnout and voter preferences. Metadata in the files suggested that the database wasn’t Deep Root’s working copy, but rather a post-election version of its data, the source said, adding that it was somewhat surprising the files hadn’t been discarded.\n\nBecause the data from the 2008 and 2012 elections is outdated—the source compared it to the kind of address and phone data one could find on a “lousy internet lookup site”—it’s not very valuable. Even the 2016 data is quickly becoming stale. “This is a proprietary dataset based on a mix of public records, data from commercial providers, and a variety of predictive models of uncertain provenance and quality,” the source said, adding: “Undoubtedly it took millions of dollars to produce.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough basic voter information is public record, Deep Root’s dataset contains a swirl of proprietary information from the RNC’s data firms. Many of the filenames indicate that they potentially contain market research on Democratic candidates and the independent expenditure committees that support them. (Up to two terabytes of data contained on the server was protected by permission settings.)\n\nOne exposed folder is labeled “Exxon-Mobile” [sic] and contains spreadsheets apparently used to predict which voters support the oil and gas industry. Divided by state, the files include the voters’ names and addresses, along with a unique RNC identification number assigned to every US citizen registered to vote. Each row indicates where voters likely fall on issues of interest to ExxonMobil, the country’s biggest natural gas producer.\n\nThe data evaluates, for example, whether or not a specific voter believes drilling for fossil fuels is vital to US security. It also predicts if the voter thinks the US should be moving away from fossil-fuel use. The ExxonMobil “national score” document alone contains data on 182,746,897 Americans spread across 19 fields.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReddit analysis\n\nSome of the data included in Deep Root’s dataset veers into downright bizarre territory. A folder titled simply ‘reddit’ houses 170 GBs of data apparently scraped from several subreddits, including the controversial r/fatpeoplehate that was home to a community of people who posted pictures of people and mocked them for their weight before it was banned from Reddit’s platform in 2015. Other subreddits that appear to have been scraped by Deep Root or a partner organization focused on more benign topics, like mountain biking and the Spanish language.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Reddit data could’ve been used as training data for an artificial intelligence algorithm focused on natural language processing, or it might have been harvested as part of an effort to match up Reddit users with their voter registration records. During the 2012 election cycle, Barack Obama’s campaign data team relied on information gleaned from Facebook profiles and matched profiles to voter records.\n\nDuring the 2016 election season, Reddit played host to a legion of Trump supporters who gathered in subreddits like r/The_Donald to comb through leaked Democratic National Committee emails and craft pro-Trump memes. Trump himself participated in an “Ask Me Anything” session on r/The_Donald during his campaign.\n\nGiven how active some Trump supporters are on Reddit—r/The_Donald currently boasts more than 430,000 members—it makes sense that Trump’s data team might be interested in analyzing data from the site.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA FiveThirtyEight analysis that looked at where r/The_Donald members spend their time when they’re not talking politics might shed some light onto why Deep Root collected r/fatpeoplehate data. FiveThirtyEight found that, when Redditors weren’t commenting in political subreddits, they most often frequented r/fatpeoplehate.\n\n\n\nIt’s possible that Deep Root intended to use data from r/fatpeoplehate to build a more comprehensive profile of Trump voters. (Lundry declined to comment beyond his initial statement on any of information included in the Deep Root dataset.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, FiveThirtyEight’s investigation doesn’t account for Deep Root’s collection of data from mountain-biking and Spanish-speaking subreddits that weren’t as popular with r/The_Donald members—and data from these subreddits that are not so closely linked to Trump’s diehard supporters might be more useful for his campaign’s goal of pursuing swing voters.\n\n\n\n“My guess is that they were scraping Reddit posts to match to the voter file as another input for individual modeling,” a source familiar with campaign data operations told Gizmodo. “Given the number of random forums, my guess is they started with a list of accounts to scrape from, rather than scraping from all forums then trying to match from there (in which case you’d start with the political ones).”\n\nMatching voter records with Reddit usernames would be complicated and any large-scale effort would likely result in many inaccuracies, the source said. However, campaigns have attempted to match voter files with social media profiles in the past. Such an effort by Deep Root wouldn’t be entirely surprising, and would likely yield rich data on the small portion of users it was able to match with their voter profiles, the source explained.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nData exposes sensitive voter info\n\nThe Deep Root incident represents the largest known leak of Americans’ voter records, outstripping past exposures by several million records. Five voter-file leaks over the past 18 months exposed between 350,000 and 191 million files, some of which paired voter data—name, race, gender, birthdate, address, phone number, party affiliation, etc.—with email accounts, social media profiles, and records of gun ownership.\n\n“I can think of no avenues for punishing political data breaches or otherwise properly aligning the incentives.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCampaigns and the data analysis firms they employ are a particularly weak point for data exposure, security experts say. Corporations that don’t properly secure customer data can face significant financial repercussions—just ask Target or Yahoo. But because campaigns are short-term operations, there’s not much incentive for them to take data security seriously, and valuable data is often left out to rust after an election.\n\n“Campaigns are very narrowly focused. They are shoestring operations, even presidential campaigns. So they don’t think of this as an asset they need to protect,” the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Hall told Gizmodo.\n\nEven though voter rolls are public record and are easy to access—Ohio, for instance, makes its voter rolls available to download online—their exposure can still be harmful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVoter registration records include ZIP codes, birthdates, and other personal information that have been crucial in research efforts to re-identify anonymous medical data. Latanya Sweeney, a professor of government and technology at Harvard University, famously used voter data to re-identify Massachusetts Governor William Weld from information in anonymous hospital discharge records.\n\nBecause of the personal information they contain, voter registration databases can also be useful in identity theft schemes.\n\nEven though exposure of Deep Root’s data has the potential to harm voters, it’s exactly the kind of data that campaigns lust after and will spend millions of dollars to obtain. Campaigns are motivated to accumulate as much deeply personal information about voters as possible, so they can spend their ad dollars in the right swing districts where they’re likely to sway the greatest number of voters. But voter data rapidly goes stale and campaigns close up shop quickly, so data is seen as disposable and often isn’t well-protected.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I can think of no avenues for punishing political data breaches or otherwise properly aligning the incentives. I worry that if there’s no way to punish campaigns for leaking this stuff, it’s going to continue to happen until something bad happens,” Hall said. The data left behind by campaigns can pose a lingering security issue, he added. “None of these motherfuckers were ever Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts, they don’t pack out what they pack in.”\n\n[UpGuard]",

    "article_text": "Data tools that once helped Obama have fallen into the hands of the Trump campaign. | Getty Data tools of Obama veterans aiding Trump campaign\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign has driven key decisions by using advanced data tools developed by veterans of President Barack Obama’s first White House run, says a former Trump campaign staffer — a revelation that surprised and angered liberal campaign veterans.\n\nMatt Braynard, the Trump campaign’s data lead for five months of the primary season, disclosed the use of the technology on Tuesday during a POLITICO discussion at the Republican National Convention. He said his team had, through a third-party vendor, tapped voter models created by HaystaqDNA, a firm founded by the directors of data targeting and data analytics for Barack Obama’s groundbreaking 2008 White House bid.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe data models are designed to predict to a high level of accuracy how Americans will vote based on mixing and matching a wide variety of characteristics — from their support for U.S. humanitarian intervention abroad to their thinking on ride-on-demand services like Lyft and Uber.\n\n“The Obama analytics operation in 2008 and 2012 went out to start a firm called HaystaqDNA — very successful,” Braynard said. “Their data drove almost every decision for us in terms of who got mail, whose door got knocked on, who got volunteer phone calls [or] paid phone calls, email, all of that.\"\n\nKen Strasma, HaystaqDNA’s co-founder and CEO, acknowledged that his firm sold its data models to L2, the nonpartisan Washington state-based voter data vendor used by the Trump campaign.\n\nBut Strasma disputed Braynard’s contention that the Trump campaign had gotten “complete access” to the data models or that it was done \"without their\" — that is, HaystaqDNA's — \"knowledge.\"\n\n“Once we provide that to L2, they are free to sell that to whoever they choose,” said Strasma. On the Trump campaign's use of those models, he added: \"It wouldn't have been our first choice.\"\n\nHaystaqDNA is seen by many in the field as a progressive firm. It advertises itself as having “pioneered the predictive analytics that helped the Obama campaign make history in 2008.”\n\nWord that the firm's technology had fallen into the hands of Trump is sparking a sharp reaction from some who work in progressive digital politics.\n\n“Next year @Netroots_Nation should ban @L2political and @HaystaqDNA. Folks who empower racism and bigotry are not in our tent,\" tweeted Melissa Byrne, a member of Bernie Sanders' digital organizing staff.\n\nBraynard says he left the Trump campaign over a conflict with its previous leadership. The Trump campaign couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n\nStrasma stressed that the models sold through L2 are pre-packaged products, not the sort of ultra-customized work or consulting services the company offers to progressive candidates such as Sanders, with whom it worked during the Democratic primaries.\n\nToday, \"our strategic advice and our hearts are with the Clinton campaign,\" said Strasma. \"But with our more commoditized, generic models, we don't control who's able to buy them.\"\n\nStrasma said his company had made the decision to offer its products to L2 without a restriction that would have limited their use to customers on the left in part because they intended the lower-cost tools to be used on small-scale issue work — such as a local environmental action — that can often target supporters on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nHe said he was surprised to hear that a high-stakes presidential campaign, like Trump's, would opt to use his firm's off-the-shelf tools.\n\nThe Trump campaign, however, has a pattern of using consumer-grade technology. It has powered its website and online organizing efforts using NationBuilder, an online content management system that has been criticized for being available to all comers despite the progressive roots of its leadership staff.\n\nAt the panel, Braynard explained that the Trump campaign used HaystaqDNA's data tools to pinpoint a specific type of would-be supporter.\n\n\"These are people who are rich in the wisdom of the Old Testament,\" said Braynard. \"They have a very un-nuanced view of the world and a very realistic view of the world and the threats the country faces, domestically and foreign.”\n\nPaul Westcott, L2’s director of marketing and communications, said his company has been eager to advertise its relationship with HaystaqDNA.\n\n“This isn’t ‘Obama data,’\" said Westcott. “Our understanding is just that they’re very good at what they do, and we wanted to work with them.\" He added, \"From the White House on down, if they care, they can see what we’re pushing. It’s not a secret.”",

    "article_text": "Russian trolls are influencing how Facebook lets advertisers target its users.\n\nFacebook is now stipulating that targeted political ads on its platform undergo human review, which could slow down how quickly marketers can get their Facebook ads up and running. While the change in ad reviews will have the biggest impact on political advertisers, it is notable because it shows the pressure Facebook is facing for letting a Russian troll farm buy ads on its platform is leading the social giant to make adjustments.\n\n“Many ad campaigns are last-minute in response to the current information flow of a campaign and thus require quick starts and switches,” said an executive of a political consultancy, who requested anonymity out of fear of irritating Facebook. “If Facebook is not nimble in reviewing and approving ads, it will affect how much we spend on the platform.”\n\nLast week, Facebook announced it will require “certain types” of targeted ads to be manually reviewed. Facebook declined an interview request for this story, but Axios reported that Facebook ads that target users based on politics or social issues will be reviewed by a human before they go live.\n\nAdvertisers are used to Facebook approving their ads within hours and getting immediate feedback in their dashboard, where they can monitor results. A slowdown of the approval process would make it harder for advertisers to quickly make adjustments to their campaigns.\n\n“The near-instantaneous nature of Facebook advertising is a critical part of its strategic importance,” said Chris Wexler, executive director of media and analytics at ad agency Cramer-Krasselt. “And if for some reason this slows that down, it will impact brands significantly.”\n\nThe impact of Facebook’s updated ad-review process will depend on the length of delays for approving targeted ads and how precisely Facebook regulates political targeting on its platform, which remain unclear.

    "article_text": "Sanders TV ad\n\nCORRECTION: This story originally reported that the campaign expenditures listed herein encompassed all of 2015 but that is incorrect. They refer only to expenditures made by candidate campaigns in the fourth quarter of 2015, from October 1 through December 31, 2015.\n\nWe hear a lot about how much money the 2016 presidential hopefuls are spending on ads. But there's an entire industry dedicated to churning campaign donor dollars into direct mail, TV spots, social-media efforts, data analytics, opposition research and more. In the fourth quarter, the Bernie Sanders campaign's TV-focused media agency Old Towne Media scored the most campaign cash -- $10.6 million -- among agencies working with the remaining presidential campaigns.\n\nAs the race grinds ahead to the South, it's apparent already that some consultancies bet on (or more likely, got chosen by) the wrong horses. Digital and fundraising firm Upstream Communications and data company TargetPoint Consulting lost their 2016 presidential client when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie threw in the towel after a tough loss in New Hampshire. When Kentucky Senator Rand Paul called it quits after a poor showing in Iowa, his digital consultancy Harris Media also was out a big client, one founder Vincent Harris praised in a post-mortem essay for having digital \"integrated into everything.\"\n\nBut with a still-contentious Republican primary race and a neck-and-neck Democratic primary continuing into the foreseeable future, there are many more still standing. Some have already been paid millions by the campaigns, with much of that money going towards TV and digital ad buys. Among the biggest winners thus far, according to Ad Age analysis of Federal Election Commission reports, are Old Towne Media and Revolution Messaging, the TV and digital firms used by the Bernie Sanders campaign; GMMB, the ad firm used by Hillary Clinton, which was also President Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaign choice; Marco Rubio's media agency, Smart Media Group; and the new kid on the block, London-based Cambridge Analytica, the data analytics and targeting firm employed by Ted Cruz.\n\nSome of the political firms that have garnered the most media attention don't appear to be profiting from the campaigns themselves much at all. While the Koch Brothers-affiliated data firm i360 has done work with the Jeb Bush and John Kasich campaigns, FEC reports show the candidates spent less than $50,000 combined with the company in the fourth quarter. GOP data firm Data Trust doesn't show up at all. WPP-owned Blue State Digital, the Democratic agency that helped propel Obama's '08 campaign to digital stardom, is a mere blip on the Clinton camp's spending screen. Targeted Victory, the company that made its name as 2012 candidate Mitt Romney's digital shop, earned only around $250,000 from the Cruz camp in late 2015, in addition to much smaller payouts for managing fundraising services for other GOP campaigns.\n\nBut FEC reports can be deceiving. Data firms and other specialized consultancies may not show up at all because they aren't hired directly by campaigns; rather, their services might be outsourced by larger agencies. Also, it's important to note that for this story Ad Age looked only at spending by the campaigns, not their PACs, which in some cases command much bigger budgets.\n\nWith that in mind, Ad Age has compiled a list of media agencies, direct mail firms, political consultancies and data firms that earned $100,000 or more for the quarter from the presidential campaigns still standing. The list does not include common political campaign services such as compliance, payroll management, fundraising technology platforms, travel expenses and staff.

    "article_text": "Facebook faces an uphill battle in cleaning up political advertising on its platform.\n\nFacebook is making adjustments to how political advertisers buy ads on its platform. It’ll still be hard for the social media giant to identify all of the political ads running through its system, though.\n\nFacebook can detect a political ad in two main ways. One is by looking at the creative of the ad itself; the other is by looking at who it’s targeted to.\n\nAs for the ad creative, Facebook can scan the creative to detect if political content is present, but some political advertisers release hundreds of versions of the same ad within minutes, which allows them to A/B test their creative until they find the right combination of text and imagery that slips by Facebook’s filters.\n\nThose advertisers also use their own data to create nuanced proxy audiences that make it difficult to identify the true intent of their messages. For instance, if fans of a particular TV show are likely to want criminal justice reform, an advertiser advocating against private prisons could target fans of that show to obfuscate the political purpose of the ad. Creating so many permutations of the same ad and using unique data to indirectly target political messages are tactics that ad buyers can use to cloak the partisanship of their data targeting and ad creative.\n\n“Advertising platforms would have to make a considerable investment to catch all political ads,” said Mark Jablonowski, chief technology officer of DSPolitical, an ad-targeting firm used by liberal advertisers. “And they almost certainly won’t catch everything, no matter the spend.”\n\nThe pressure Facebook faces for letting a Russian troll farm buy ads on its platform is leading the social giant to change its approach to political advertising. Earlier this month, Facebook announced it would hire 1,000 people to review ads on its platform and require politically targeted ads to be manually reviewed.\n\nU.S. senators also recently introduced a bill called the Honest Ads Act that would require digital platforms to make public information about political ads they host. Facebook declined an interview request for this story.\n\nDigiday Content Marketing Summit Vail, CO Register Now Subscribe to our daily newsletter during Cannes for invitations to exclusive Digiday events, previews of the day ahead and key highlights. Subscribe Now\n\nThe other way Facebook can identify a political ad is by looking at who it’s targeted to. Depending on the type of data that political advertisers use to buy ads on Facebook, it can be hard for Facebook to detect that the ad is political, which would trigger a human review by Facebook, said John Randall, vp of digital at ad agency Craft, which specializes in advocacy campaigns for politically conservative groups.\n\nThe first type of data is Facebook’s own audience data. This data would be used if someone wanted to target users who, say, self-identified on Facebook as a Democrat or liked Facebook pages related to Hillary Clinton. It is easiest to identify politically targeted ads when this type of data is used, Randall said.\n\nThe second type of data is third-party data that an advertiser uploads into Facebook. This data can come from a political database like The Data Trust or a nonpolitical data aggregator like Acxiom that’s used for political targeting.\n\nSpotting when this data is used for political purposes is harder than spotting when Facebook’s own data is used to target political ads. However, the more popular data aggregators are frequently used on Facebook, so the social platform has a lot of experience identifying which data sets belong to which providers and how that information might be used to target users.\n\nThe third type of data is first-party data from an advertiser itself that’s uploaded to Facebook, and this data is the hardest to spot political association, Randall said. Advertisers can combine their own surveys with voter file and census data to create unique data sets coded and labeled however the advertiser desires. The various types of data are not mutually exclusive to a campaign. For example, an advertiser using its own first-party data might combine its data with Facebook’s geographic data.\n\nWith a unique data set, an advertiser can politically target ads without being obvious about it, said Ken Strasma, CEO of HaystaqDNA, an analytics firm that has worked on campaigns for former President Barack Obama and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Rather than using Facebook’s data to simply target people who liked Hillary Clinton’s Facebook page or using third-party data to target young voters, who are more likely to vote for a Democrat, an advertiser trying to reach liberal voters can mine its proprietary data for patterns of particular policy positions aligning with nonpolitical criteria.\n\nThe data firm Deep Root Analytics helped the Trump campaign identity “NCIS” as being popular with anti-Obamacare voters and “The Walking Dead” as being popular with people who favor stricter immigration laws, for example. Political advertisers could theoretically combine their data with Facebook’s data to give the impression they are targeting “NCIS” fans, when in reality, they are subtly using a proxy audience to send a politically charged message.\n\nAt some point, the definition of political advertising becomes existential. Aside from using nonpolitical categories to target political messages, advertisers also use political criteria to target nonpolitical products, Strasma said. An example of this is that advertisers selling gold coins will target conservatives since they are more likely to mistrust the government and its currency.\n\nMarketers say that adding human reviewers will indeed help Facebook flag more political ads. But beefing up the review process still won’t catch everything, and it could slow down how quickly marketers get their Facebook ads up and running.\n\n“It’s a question of resources,” Strasma said. “If Facebook or other sites employ enough people and manually review every ad, they can catch most [political ads], but only at tremendous cost both in terms of salary and in terms of inconvenience to the advertisers who value quick turnaround.”",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON – A former Donald Trump campaign insider wants to set the record straight on a major story he says the chattering classes missed: It’s about Trump’s core supporters, who they are, and why they’re drawn to him.\n\nIt was Matt Braynard’s job to identify these supporters. He led Trump’s data operation in the early primaries, a position that gave him a unique vantage point into an epochal political phenomenon.\n\nThe media misdiagnosed it, he says. They focused on economics, education and race – factors Braynard calls negligible.\n\nBraynard says he spotted something else. As he sifted data and learned to predict with 80 per cent certainty whether someone would prefer Trump to his rivals, he noticed a common worldview. He won’t discuss it in detail, but offers hints.\n\nIt involves certain types of strength – forceful positions on controversial issues, support for law-and-order at home, and a take-no-prisoners attitude on foreign terrorism.\n\n“The way I like to phrase it is these are people who are rich in the wisdom of the Old Testament. It’s a way of looking at the world,” Braynard said in an interview.\n\n“At this time of domestic and international turmoil, people want someone who can tell the truth, be strong, and not take (crap) from anyone… Our candidate, effectively, is the law-and-order candidate. And when you’ve got Black Lives Matter terrorists murdering cops on the street, there’s been no better time for a candidate to wear that mantle…\n\n“It cut across all kinds of lines – racial, geographic, income.”\n\nBraynard chafes at a one-word label some political science professors have applied to these voters: authoritarian. “It’s part of the left’s narrative to turn Trump into Hitler. And it is also a smear on Trump supporters.”\n\nBraynard ran the data operation from October through the early primaries when he had a falling-out with the campaign. He began by leasing a voter-data package from the company L2, which included material from a firm founded by ex-Obama operatives, HaystaqDNA.\n\nHe looked for patterns that identified Trump voters.\n\nHe focused on people who’d never voted in a primary; found data that correlated with Trump support (reading Guns&Ammo magazine was one indicator); and contacted likely supporters, instructing them on how to vote in primaries.\n\n“(They’d say), ‘You know, I do like that guy.’ So we’d say, ‘Just make sure you show up and vote.’ And that’s how we won the nomination.”\n\nNot everyone missed the story he’s telling. In their version, however, it’s less flattering and more ominous. It’s told by researchers who study authoritarian voters, a branch of political science that grew from the Second World War.\n\nMatthew MacWilliams of the University of Massachusetts polled 1,800 voters last December and published his findings in a Politico piece titled: “One Weird Trait That Predicts Whether You’re a Trump Supporter.”\n\nHe said respondents who expressed the strongest authoritarian impulses were almost three times likelier to support Trump than those who scored lowest; other Republicans registered no similar spike.\n\n“It only mattered for Trump,” MacWilliams said in an interview. “The polling on it couldn’t be clearer… People who are disposed to authoritarianism are more likely to be core supporters for Trump.”\n\nThe Vox website conducted its own poll, finding similar results. Yet a study by Eric Oliver and Wendy Rahn arrived at a different conclusion – that Trump’s popularity with authoritarians was lower than Ted Cruz’s.\n\nSo who are these people?\n\nTo identify authoritarians, political science professors use a simple parenting quiz: Would you prefer an independent or respectful child? Curious or well-mannered? Self-reliant or obedient? Considerate or well-behaved? The more one prefers the second trait, the more authoritarian they are likely to be, researchers say.\n\nTop-level authoritarians comprise about 25 per cent of the American electorate, says Jonathan Weiler of the University of North Carolina.\n\nWeiler, the co-author of “Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics,” says that, historically, these votes were evenly split between U.S. parties. But he found that over the last quarter-century they shifted, coalescing within the Republican party.\n\nEnter Trump, who found an ideal base: “He speaks very well to (them),” Weiler said in an interview.\n\nAuthoritarian voters see the world in binary terms, said Weiler and MacWilliams: Order-chaos. Good-evil. Us-them. Black-white, with very little grey.\n\n“Aggression and suspicion of outsiders … are really two of their key characteristics,” Weiler said.\n\n“A person who has that worldview would, for example, want to deal with … terrorist threats in the most aggressive, militaristic way. And (they’re) not just racially resentful, but in general suspicious of, and antagonistic towards, groups they’re not familiar with.”\n\nThere’s good news for Trump.\n\nAuthoritarians are unwaveringly loyal: “Remember when a Rubio adviser said, in January, ‘Trump’s support is like granite, there’s no way to chip at it?”’ said MacWilliams.\n\n“That’s because they were authoritarians. They made a decision, and weren’t going to change. Remember when Trump said, ‘I could go out on Fifth Avenue, shoot someone, and not lose votes?”’\n\nAnd their numbers can grow. First, non-authoritarians have hopped aboard the Trump train out of loyalty to the Republican party. Then, say Weiler and MacWilliams, chaotic events like terrorist attacks temporarily expand the number of authoritarian-minded voters.\n\nThe bad news for Trump?\n\nHis other attributes might turn off a part-time authoritarian, Weiler said: “I don’t know if Trump projects (steadiness in a crisis). I think Bush projected really solid, steady strength after 9-11… Trump is unhinged.”",

    "article_text": "Issue: Opposed to Muslim Ban - L2 Data\n\nIn the wake of the presidential election many Democrats who relied on big data to predict big wins were despondent. \"We were wrong,\" said one Democratic strategist on condition of anonymity. \"We were overconfident and need to completely rethink our models. But let me say that again: We need to rethink our models, and not the use of data.\"\n\nPaul Westcott, Director of Marketing and Communications for L2 Political, cheerfully agrees. Big data was the big winner of the 2016 election, and the industry is booming. \"The data industry has been heavily scrutinized. In fact, because of greater processing, the availability of more data sources, and better feedback loops, the political data industry performed well,\" Westcott said. \"I can say that with certainty because our data was used by hundreds of down ballot races but also by every presidential primary contestant, either through their PAC or the campaign directly.\"\n\nSEE: Quick glossary: Big data (Tech Pro Research)\n\nBig data is L2's core competency. The company has a 40-year legacy of providing data for political and enterprise clients. L2's database contains key data points about more than 240 consumers, including demographic and geographic information, voting history political affiliation, likely household income and spending habits, and media market. Data is visualized using the Bing API with HaystaqDNA, allowing clients to zoom in to see individual data or zoom out to see a macro-profile of a region or the entire country. Consumer records are exportable in common file formats like CSV and XLS.\n\nThough the Clinton campaign was often associated with big data sophistication, the Trump campaign also bought data from L2 and other data vendors. \"The Trump campaign tapped data and analytics firms,\" Westcott said, \"to micro-target individuals by building complex turnout models and using predictive analytics. Many believe the Trump campaign was purely an earned media machine that won because of tweets and TV appearances. In both the primary and general, predictive models were heavily used by the Trump team to target and speak to 'likely Trump voters.'\"\n\nWATCH: Documentary shows information revolution of big data (CBS News)\n\nData accessibility was one of the biggest innovations of the 2016 presidential campaign, Westcott said. Historically, cutting edge technologies have been out of reach for small businesses and small campaigns alike. This cycle, market demand for sophisticated voter-targeted technology brought the cost of data tools down. \"We worked with many campaigns with districts of under 50,000 voters... for digital, mail, email, phone, and other targeting. Meaning, city council races determined outreach based on [data] models focused on the economy, environment, immigration, and dozens of other [issues].\"\n\nBig data innovations that played out in the political cycle, Westcott said, will have a big impact on the private sector in 2017 and 2018. \"We're expecting the even greater use of predictive models... for digital advertising, social media targeting, and in all traditional outreach,\" he said. \"Political ad tech has been a heavily partisan industry. That will change in the 2018 cycle as political ad buyers start looking for a market-based solution instead of a party-based solution.\"\n\nL2 gave TechRepublic access to election and issue-related data maps.

    "article_text": "Sanders may not have acknowledged Hillary Clinton’s historic victory yet, but he knows the writing’s on the wall. Slowly but surely, he’s transitioning from “Guy Running for President” to “Guy Leading a Movement.” Sanders has vowed to compete in Washington, D.C.’s primary, but he’s increasingly using his time to signal to his supporters and to the Democratic leadership that he’ll exit the race.\n\nSpeaking at a rally in D.C. on Thursday, Sanders didn’t mention Clinton or the convention. Instead he told the crowd that, to have an impact, they need to stick together: “We need real change in this country,” he said. “And what people also understand is that no president, not Bernie Sanders, not anybody else, can do it alone.”\n\nSanders’s staffers, too, seem eager to work with Clinton. “We’ll all be helping the Hillary team in the general election in one capacity or another,” the CEO of HaystaqDNA, a predictive analysis company that works closely with Sanders, told Politico. “Getting a bunch of kids stoked on the process is very important to ensure a Trump presidency is not possible,” said Sanders videographer Arun Chadhaury. The Clinton camp had made its first hire from Sanders’s team: Kunoor Ojha, who led its student organizing team.\n\nThe portion of the race where Bernie Sanders was running for president is over. For all of the stories being kicked around about Sanders’s bitterness and vanity, he’s doing exactly what he should be doing right now: transitioning out of the race in a way that should help him bring his supporters into the fold by November.",

    "article_text": "When you display big buckets of voter data on a map—coded red for Republican and blue for Democrat—the United States is clearly a purple country.\n\nEvery campaign, from presidential to local elections, relies on big data. Specifically, campaigns buy voter information and social media data. L2 Political is one of the most widely used campaign data vendors. Customers range from presidential campaigns to local elections to PACs. The product is a powerful window to information like voter name, party affiliation, voting history, and other demographic and geographic information. L2 displays voter data on a map overlay and spits out information in common file formats like CSV.\n\nBig data is has become a critical tool for campaigns. TechRepublic spoke with L2's Director of Communications Paul Westcott about how voter information is bought and sold, the future of data management, and how information tools help campaigns, firms, and SMBs better understand markets.\n\nThe phrase \"big data\" gets thrown around a lot these days, but what specific types of data are used by campaigns?\n\nCampaigns are starting to rival the brand side of the business in the amount of information they use to microtarget individuals. Voter files themselves are powerful tools that give you some very strong baseline information including [voter] name, age, party ID, gender, complex voting history, and address.\n\nIn order to make these segments usable we created a selection and visualization tool called L2 VoterMapping. L2 VoterMapping allows users to make selections instantly, get [numbers], and build universes for outreach like mailing, phones, [canvass] walk lists, and digital targeting like email, cookie, and device ID tracking.\n\nHere are a few of the datasets used by L2:\n\nConsumer data, e.g., Income, Education, Children, Occupation, and Hobbies & Interests.\n\nCensus data\n\nContribution data, both private file and FEC\n\nHaystaqDNA Modeled Issue Data. This is modeled data that gives scores to individual voters on gun control, gay marriage, abortion, rideshare, and turnout.\n\nOther Government data, e.g., gun ownership.\n\nSEE: Big decisions with big data (Tech Pro Research story)\n\nCan you explain how voter data has evolved?\n\nPolitical data used to be limited to address, simple vote history, and possibly party ID. And the only data came from states and counties. L2 started in 1975 as 'Labels & Lists' in Washington state, and made that data actionable by allowing a client to call our offices, request a broad or targeted group of individuals, and print a walk or call list or mailing labels. In the last 40 years the amount of data and the ways [data] is used has grown exponentially.\n\nWhere and how do you acquire data?\n\n[Our] data comes from a variety of sources, including states, and counties and municipalities that provide the raw voter data. Once that data is brought in it is scrubbed against the national change of address database, the Social Security death index, and commercial files among scores of other checks. The commercial data comes from a variety of sources, including Experian.\n\nWe have hundreds of segments of voter, demographic, consumer, census, contribution and modeled issue data. Data itself can be delivered via secure FTP, API, or through our platform.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow is social media data used by campaigns, and by business?\n\nSocial media outreach, specifically Facebook, has been in high demand this year. While we don't append social media handles directly to the voter file, we [use] LiveRamp. LiveRamp attaches cookies and Device IDs, and allows for digital targeting through social media. We're also working with a number of companies that specifically take high-quality, off-line lists, create segments, and upload to Facebook allowing campaigns and other organizations the ability to target ads to specific voters.\n\nREAD: The Power of IoT and Big Data (Tech Pro Research insights)\n\nBased on your data, what issues do voters care about this year?\n\nL2 is working with HaystaqDNA, who built the models for Obama for America. They built dozens of issue-specific models. This allows us to [understand] what voters think about about guns, abortion, gay marriage, turnout, marijuana legalization, rideshare, immigration and other issues.

    "article_text": "Weird human resources\n\nStart with some of the strangest findings about how we work. The big data start-up Evolv sifts thought millions of pieces of human resources data from clients looking for insights about who applies for jobs and who succeeds at work. The idea is to help companies decide who to hire, and how to manage their teams. Evolv CEO Max Simkoff said his firm has found a series of surprising insights about corporate hiring, based on companies' own data.\n\n\"We've got data on over 3 million employees in a variety of industries and job types,\" Simkoff said. \"Companies have finally honed in on the monthly, weekly and in some cases hourly metrics that measure those employees' productivity.\"\n\n(Read more: Lisa was called a 'slut' by bank's big data hijinks)\n\nOne of the most surprising findings is just how easy it can be to tell a good applicant from a bad one with Internet-based job applications. Evolv contends that the simple distinction of which Web browser an applicant is using when he or she sends in a job application can show who's going to be a star employee and who may not be.\n\nEvolv says a willingness to adopt new technology by choosing \"nonstandard browsers\" like Firefox or Chrome is a powerful predictor of performance. Employees who use them perform better across the board than those who use standard browsers that come with most computers, like Internet Explorer and Safari.\n\nNot only do these employees stay on the job longer, miss less work and adhere better to company protocols, the company says, they provide higher customer satisfaction and close more sales.\n\nMary Murcott is chief strategy officer at a call center firm called NOVO 1, which hired Evolv to help it retain its workers and hire new people who would stay.\n\nThe company found several trends in play: Workers over the age of 30 or 40 had about half the attrition rate as younger workers. The more rank-and-file employees switch around among managers, the longer they seemed to stay with the firm. And although the firm had long been open to rehiring workers who had left, Evolv concluded that rehires left the company 44 percent faster than new hires, which made Murcott rethink her openness to ex-employees.\n\n\"That has helped us understand where we got our top people and where we got people that were not great,\" Murcott said. \"And so we've moved our recruiting dollars and our job-sourcing dollars to other avenues.\"\n\nWhat's more, Murcott said her firm has been able to focus its hiring on an unusual pool of applicants who are usually overlooked by corporate hiring managers: the long-term unemployed.\n\nWorking with Evolv, the company has developed hiring tests that de-emphasized traditional measures that have not proved effective, such as education and work experience, and emphasized personality and skills-based measures.\n\n\"We had a 55-year-old woman come in the other day—she hadn't been able to find a job, she hadn't been in the workforce, she hadn't had any job experience, and we hired her as a customer service representative,\" Murcott said. \"So here's woman that couldn't get a job, that everybody's denying, and we were able to put her on the job. She's doing great.\"\n\nBut here's the weirdest thing Evov said it has discovered: Criminals can make better employees than anyone else. Evolv calculates that employees with criminal backgrounds are 1 to 1.5 percent more productive on the job than people without criminal records, and the firm said that difference in a large company \"could result in tens of millions in profit and loss gain.\"\n\nEvolv CEO Simkoff says he's not sure why that's the case, but he guesses it's because such employees feel a sense of loyalty to the companies that took the risk to hire them.\n\nBut won't companies be reluctant to hire criminals? Simkoff said companies sometimes don't want to hear advice that they should be hiring more criminals. \"But I tell them their own data is showing this—if they want to save $10 million a year, they should make the change. But what they do with the data is ultimately up to them.\"\n\nWeird demographics\n\nVeterans of the Obama presidential campaigns—which created new ways of drilling down into databases and social media to find and motivate potential voters—have seeded a slew of new big-data analytics firms hoping to do the same for paying clients. One of them is Michael Simon, who worked on the Obama '08 campaign and is now a co-founder of the data analytics firm HaystaqDNA.\n\nSimon and his firm are looking at new ways to isolate demographic groups—slices of American society so small that they might not have been detected by traditional polling, but can now be identified and reached using technology. It's the kind of thing that can be as useful to corporate marketing folks looking for customers as it is for politicians looking for votes.\n\n(Read more: Big data's powerful effect on tiny babies)\n\n\"We're trying to understand how people who otherwise look alike are actually different, and you really need to dive beneath the surface,\" Simon said.\n\nIn one recent project, Haystaq used Google Earth images of California to find homes with solar panels on the roofs. After teaching their computers to distinguish between solar panels and other things that look similar from above, like skylights and pools, they are cross-referencing the solar panel homes with publicly available name and address information for those houses.\n\nAs a result the firm will have a list of everyone in California—and eventually the whole country—who owns a residential solar panel.\n\nThe fact that someone would buy a solar panel tells you a lot about the type of person they are: likely environmentally conscious and with enough disposable income to spend on an expensive piece of technology. Solar panel owners make up their own tiny demographic—and by scouring satellite images, marketers can now find them individually.",

Using the Bing API and HaystaqDNA, L2 overlays detailed voter and consumer records over maps of the United States. Campaigns and enterprise clients can filter by a long list of demographic and psychographic information, including voter address and phone number, voting history, party affiliation, lifestyle and work style estimates, digital advertising segment, income estimates, contributions, and other details.\n\nThis information allows campaigns to create very refined marketing campaigns. The L2 platform enables campaign workers to zoom in on a map and see specific houses and neighborhoods. The refined data chunks help canvassers knock on individual doors using a finely tuned script, phone bank callers can now call and chat with individuals, and volunteers can SMS personally with voters. The tool also spits out XML and CSV files that campaigns use with advertising CMRs to purchase ads online and automate social media channels.\n\nThe result is an electorate saturated with campaign- and election-related marketing. L2 provided TechRepublic with data about the most important battleground and swing states.

    "article_text": "In the years leading up to the 2016 election, Democrats continued investing heavily in a shared data and technology platform, NGP VAN, across liberal candidates and causes. Republicans took a more market-based approach, with high-headcount, full-service shops meant to continue product development beyond election years. Republicans wanted competition where liberals emphasized collaboration. In the wake of widely unexpected election results, have data-driven campaigners on either side shifted their approach?\n\nThe Conservative Shakeout\n\nDespite the Republican Party’s victories up and down the ballot, it wasn’t a banner year for many data-driven conservative organizations, as some technologists and agencies were reportedly blacklisted after the Republican National Committee (RNC) merged with the Trump campaign in May.\n\nThe conservative data firm i360, a unit of the Koch brothers’ Freedom Partners super PAC, abandoned the presidential race despite working with the RNC the previous year on a joint data operation. And Targeted Victory, the largest Republican digital media agency in 2012, is shutting down.\n\nMichael Beach, a co-founder of Targeted Victory who left to start a consulting business, said political agencies are ephemeral and it’s normal for staffers to move to other operations.\n\nRNC deputy digital director Samantha Osborne and Logan Dobson, the Republican National Senatorial Committee’s director of data and analytics, for instance, were both recent Targeted Victory employees.\n\nDemocrats like to emphasize their deeper talent pool of political tech entrepreneurs and vendors, but Republicans say that characteristic causes a bottleneck between candidates and their media buys. Major Republican ad spenders, such as the RNC, focused more on platform-direct deals with Google and Facebook, with most of the remainder going to nonpartisan tech and media networks.\n\n“Granted, there may be sum total fewer people whose jobs are data-driven and digital advertising on our side,” said one data consultant to the RNC who requested anonymity due to a pending job application. “But I’d rather have fewer, smarter people spending more money.”\n\nThe Trump campaign relied heavily on first-party voter matching and on platforms – Facebook especially – to do the targeting legwork, and on Rocket Fuel’s DMP for generating audience segments.\n\nNo Republican source said he or she considers Trump’s campaign a good indicator of how campaign media operations will be run in the future, but many expect the party’s major spending organizations to continue spending more with non-ideological vendors.\n\nThe Liberal Dream\n\nDespite their recent defeat, Democrats’ approach to data and tech hasn’t shifted.\n\nAndrew Drechsler, president of the liberal data analytics firm HaystaqDNA, said he sees “the one-stop shop approach” becoming more common on the Republican side, while “Democrats still have more hands on it, which can be good and bad.” It’s possible that Democrats will have to re-explore the boundary between “sharing best practices” and “overloading a campaign with partners,” he said.\n\nThe Democrats’ platform approach fosters a partnership-driven ecosystem.\n\nDSPolitical integrated with NGP VAN for an ad-targeting solution meant to extend data-driven targeting to down-ballot candidates.\n\n“The (Democratic National Committee) blessed it and pushed it out to states, but there’s no vast sum waiting [like the RNC’s $150 million],” Walsh said. “This past election, the right decided to push vast sums into the kind of targeting that we’ve been evangelizing on our side for years.”\n\nDrechsler said the Democrats’ shared tech is a net positive, but that he does expect consolidation among liberal agencies. “Clients are asking for (consolidation), and that drives change faster here than anything in the brand world.”\n\nAnd there are Democrats pursuing more of a commercial, full-service approach. The liberal digital ad firm Bully Pulpit Interactive recently acquired a strategic communications firm named Incite, which had worked exclusively with brands and public sector clients. And Bully Pulpit is being retooled with a heavier focus on brand spending.\n\nThe Nonpartisans\n\nAside from the parties, the 2016 campaign was a crucial test for many companies new to the political world.\n\nThe results were anemic. Even on the Republican side, where more money went to nonpolitical tech and media, the winners were platforms and audience hubs (largely Google and Facebook, with a second tier featuring the likes of Hulu, Pandora and Twitter), not ad tech entrants.\n\nRocket Fuel may have been a vendor to the winning campaign, but sources told AdExchanger the company secured the account by accepting bottom-of-the-barrel margins. The company built out a double-digit political accounts team and DC office – which it closed after failing to hit budget projections.\n\nMost ad tech newcomers to DC cautiously parachuted in one- or two-person teams, and many of those, like Tremor Video, TubeMogul, Quantcast, YuMe and SpotX, have tamped down political efforts or reverted executives back to nonpolitical business.\n\n“It’s hard to be in this business if you don’t have a D or R tattooed on that everybody knows about,” said Jag Duggal, Quantcast’s senior VP of strategy.\n\nIn the upcoming cycle, the new DC media-buying competition may come from more familiar faces. For instance, the political data supplier L2 is adding a media-buying solution with L2 Media, which will be helmed by JC Medici, who ran Rocket Fuel’s political business last year.\n\n“The phrase ‘political tech’ is misleading, because the tech isn’t political,” Medici said. “People pulling the levers have been overcharging because it’s a noncompetitive market, and if you’re relying solely on ‘political tech’ you’re probably in trouble.”\n\nOther data suppliers haven’t followed L2’s lead, but Jordan Lieberman, political and public affairs lead at Audience Partners, said pure modeling and data firms are stretched by plummeting rates for offline and voter data, “so I wouldn’t be surprised if as a result you see more of them try to strap on media buying.”\n\nL2 was pivoting into advertising because last year “a number of advocacy groups and campaign clients had this data but didn’t know how to run it or what to do with it, and they felt like they were letting the clients down,” Medici said. “You need healthy skepticism to make sure you’re not just telling each other what the other person wants to hear.”",

    "article_text": "How academic at centre of Facebook scandal tried – and failed – to spin personal data into gold\n\nAs Aleksandr Kogan goes before parliament on Tuesday to account for his role in the controversial harvesting of Facebook data that was later used by Cambridge Analytica, he leaves behind him two unsuccessful companies and a once-promising academic career.\n\nKogan was a young psychologist fresh off a post-doctoral fellowship when he earned an appointment as a lecturer at Cambridge University in 2012 – a coup for any academic. Just six years later, the erstwhile Dr Spectre has been maligned in the press, mocked for his eccentric name change, and banned from the social network that he thought would provide him with the data to advance his research.\n\nRevealed: Aleksandr Kogan collected Facebook users' direct messages Read more\n\nHe has also brought unwelcome scrutiny of Cambridge University’s other researchers, prompting Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg to tell the US Congress that the company is looking into “whether there was something bad going on at Cambridge University overall”.\n\nIn a recent interview with 60 Minutes, Kogan apologised for his role in the controversy, saying: “I think that the core idea we had – that everybody knows, and nobody cares – was wrong. For that, I am sincerely sorry.”\n\nThe story of Kogan’s commercial ventures reveals a world where companies traded in the currency of personal data. As Kogan declined to speak on the record with the Guardian for this article, this account is based on public records, interviews with Kogan’s associates, and emails seen by the Guardian.\n\nPlay Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer\n\nIt was at Cambridge, home of the renowned Psychometrics Centre, that Kogan became the crucial link between SCL Elections (an entity related to Cambridge Analytica) and Facebook’s vast troves of personal data. Two other Cambridge researchers, Dr Michal Kosinski and Dr David Stillwell, had pioneered the use of Facebook data for psychometric research with a Facebook quiz application, the myPersonality quiz, which launched in 2007. Kogan built his own personality quiz application in 2013, and used it for academic research, according to an email he sent to Cambridge colleagues in March.\n\nKogan was introduced to SCL Elections in January 2014 by a Cambridge psychology PhD student, according to emails seen by the Guardian.\n\nSCL offered Kogan the holy grail for a social scientist: money to pay people to take his surveys. And Kogan had something SCL wanted: a Facebook application that worked under the social network’s pre-2014 terms of service, which allowed app developers to harvest data not only from the people who installed the app, but from their friends. “New applications are not able to access friend networks and no other psychometric profiling applications exist under the old Facebook terms,” the contract that SCL and Kogan’s company ultimately signed reads.\n\nBetween that first meeting and 4 June 2014, when the contract was signed, Kogan tried to recruit Stillwell and Kosinski to work on the SCL project with him. The negotiations broke down, and John Rust, the director of the Psychometrics Centre, accused Kogan of using Kosinski’s and Stillwell’s ideas for a “get rich quick” scheme. Kogan denied the charges, defending his work as original and accusing Rust in turn of “bullying”.\n\nSpeaking to the Guardian on a previous occasion, Kogan said: “When we initially envisioned doing the project with SCL, we had planned for it to be collaboration with Michal Kosinski and David Stillwell at the Psychometrics Centre.\n\n“Even though I very much wanted to work with Michal and David, SCL felt that their position of a fee of $500,000 for the modelling portion of the project was not warranted. And so SCL asked me to remove Michal and David from the project.\n\n“I did my best to find a middle road, but neither SCL nor Michal [or] David ended up moving to a middle ground.\n\n“John Rust, the director of the Psychometrics Centre, then made a complaint to the university on behalf of Michal and David … and even though the university’s investigation resulted in no support for John’s claims, I still lost valuable collaborators that I enjoyed working with.\n\n“In the end, I believe the Psychometrics Centre wanted to get back on the project, even though SCL had moved on based on their negative experience with them.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters outside the US Capitol in Washington as Mark Zuckerberg testifies about Facebook’s privacy policies. Photograph: Aaron Bernstein/Reuters\n\nAt the end of May 2014, Kogan established the company, Global Science Research Ltd (GSR) that signed the contract with SCL Elections. Kogan’s co-director of GSR, and a witness to the contract’s execution, was Joseph Chancellor, a post-doctoral student in Kogan’s lab who is currently employed by Facebook. Kogan described Chancellor as an equal partner in the enterprise to 60 Minutes, saying: “We did everything together”. A spokesman for Facebook defended the company’s disparate treatment of the business partners, saying of Chancellor: “His work at Facebook is unrelated to what he did previously.”\n\nDespite Rust’s accusations, the contract did not offer any financial remuneration to Kogan and Chancellor. Instead, they would be rewarded with data – both the Facebook data and an additional dataset of 1 million citizens of Trinidad and Tobago – which they would go on to attempt to spin into both academic and commercial gold. The Guardian understands that Kogan never received the Trinidad and Tobago dataset.\n\nIn August 2014, GSR added another director, who described himself as the chief financial officer and co-founder of GSR on his LinkedIn profile in December 2014.\n\n“The company owns a massive data pool of 40+ million individuals across the United States – for each of whom we have generated detailed characteristic and trait profiles,” the LinkedIn profile stated at the time.\n\nThe profile described two products being offered by GSR: Peek, a tool to help businesses understand the “psychological, economic, ethnographic knowledge” profiles of their customer bases, and SurveyExtender, a tool to forecast survey results.\n\nWhen the Guardian contacted Kogan in December 2014, he affirmed by email that GSR was developing the two products, which he compared, respectively, to CubeYou and SurveyMonkey. (Facebook suspended CubeYou from its platform in April 2018, following inquiries about data usage from CNBC).\n\nFar more than 87m Facebook users had data compromised, MPs told Read more\n\nIt would be another year before the Guardian published an article revealing that Cambridge Analytica was using the Facebook data to target voters for Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign.\n\nIn the meantime, Kogan continued to work with the Facebook data, both for academic research and for GSR, which had a website promoting its tools to “optimise marketing strategies with the power of big data and psychological sciences”. He maintained a close relationship with Facebook, which provided him with an anonymised, aggregate dataset of 57 billion Facebook friendships for research purposes. He told 60 Minutes: “I even did a consulting project with Facebook in November of 2015, and what I was teaching them was lessons I learned from working with this dataset that we had collected for Cambridge Analytica, so I was explaining, ‘Here’s kinda what we did, and here’s what we learned, and here’s how you could apply it internally to help you with surveys and survey predictions and things like that.’”\n\nIn June 2015, Kogan also established a Delaware corporation, Philometrics, which remains active and of which he is CEO.\n\nChancellor resigned as a director of GSR in September 2015 and was hired by Facebook a few months later. According to public documents, however, he remained a partial owner of the company through May 2016.\n\nAfter the Guardian’s publication of the December 2015 exposé, Facebook contacted Kogan and required him to delete the GSR data. The company also ceased collaborating with Kogan on research related to the 57 billion friendship data set. The end result was a major setback for Kogan and especially his graduate students, who had to abandon about 18 months of work.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aleksandr Kogan in April. Photograph: AP\n\nIn March 2016, Kogan wrote to Rust and Stillwell of the Psychometrics Centre to request access to the myPersonality dataset for one of his PhD students, who had been using the GSR dataset for his dissertation, according to emails seen by the Guardian.\n\nRust rejected Kogan’s appeal, writing: “I think it completely inappropriate that we should have anything more to do with you or your companies.”\n\nWith Kogan’s academic career sputtering, he appears to have turned his attention to building SurveyExtender into a viable product, now under the auspices of Philometrics. The Guardian understands that the version of SurveyExtender marketed by Philometrics did not use the GSR Facebook data.\n\nKogan moved to San Francisco, though he has maintained his position at Cambridge in order to supervise his remaining PhD students. His company attracted the attention of at least one investor, the media monitoring firm Meltwater. In his 2017 book Outside Insight, Meltwater’s founder Jørn Lyseggen interviewed Kogan, who was using his married name, Alex Spectre, at the time. Lyseggen describes Philometrics as a “pioneer” in the realm of garnering consumer insights and competitive intelligence from social media data.\n\nThe Guardian view on Facebook: time to tame the surveillance economy | Editorial Read more\n\nIn October 2017, GSR was dissolved. That same month, Kogan registered a UK business, Philometrics Ltd, of which Kogan was CEO and the US Philometrics was the sole shareholder.\n\nKogan and at least one of his employees worked out of Meltwater’s San Francisco office for a time. A spokeswoman for Meltwater confirmed that the company is a minority investor in Philometrics and that a Philometrics employees “contributed time on an internal Meltwater pilot project attempting to predict future values of cryptocurrencies”.\n\nThe company appears to have soured on Kogan, however.\n\n“Meltwater invested in Philometrics because of Alex Spectre’s impressive background as a professor from Cambridge University and the prospect of him recruiting valuable talents he knew from Cambridge,” a spokeswoman told the Guardian by email. “There were no Facebook data in the company Meltwater invested in.”\n\nShe continued: “Alex never succeeded in building Philometrics into a successful company. As far as we understand Philometrics is today a company with very limited operations and employees.”",

Cambridge Analytica was part of the Trump campaign’s data operation during the 2016 election, the newspapers report.\n\nFacebook suspended Cambridge Analytica, and its affiliated British company, SCL Group, along with Kogan, for possibly violating its terms of service and is investigating the matter. The firm is also under investigation in both the U.S. and the U.K., according to The Guardian and The Times. Both newspapers spoke with whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who left the company he co-founded in 2014.\n\nKogan describes himself on a tech-funding website by saying, “I’ve worked in science and tech startups for the past decade. I’m trained as a social psychologist with a strong focus on quantitative methods. In other words, I love math, people, and fuzzy problems.”\n\nHe adds on a personal blog, “Much of my research focuses on well-being and kindness, but more recently, I’ve been interested in understanding how we can scale survey research without scaling the costs :-p. … Born in the Soviet Union, I split my childhood half there and half in NYC where my family immigrated. I currently live in the Bay Area.”\n\nAccording to the University of Singapore, where Kogan gave a talk in 2014, “Alex’s research interests are broadly centered on the biological, contextual, cultural, and experiential forces that shape human kindness and well-being. Alex’s work has been featured in numerous media outlets, including BBC, Time, CNN, and Discovery Magazine.”\n\nHere’s what you need to know about Kogan and his role in the Cambridge Analytica controversy:\n\n1.

Full interview, tonight on 9p ET, on @CNN https://t.co/9L3itGMW79 pic.twitter.com/z4ny9vytCp — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) March 21, 2018\n\nAleksandr Kogan told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that Facebook is making him a “scapegoat.” He said he suspects suspects thousands of other developers and data scientists have used similar methods to gather information on Facebook users.\n\n“Using users’ data for profit is their business model,” he told CNN. Kogan said he does not believe he broke Facebook policies and said he would be willing to testify before Congress or speak to authorities. He said he didn’t know what Cambridge Analytica would be doing with the data he gave them.\n\n“I was pretty heavily silo’d as far as anything as funders or clients, I found out about Donald Trump just like everyone else, through the news,” he said. “They initially approached me to do some consulting work for them, mostly on surveys and then this project was born to collect new data. And they guided us through it. I was an academic, I didn’t know anything about starting a company. Chris (Wylie) said ‘go start a company,’ he told me how to do it, he explained, ‘well here’s the terms of service you need to put into this app and basically assured all of this was common place and best practice.”\n\nKogan told CNN he knew it would be used for political consulting, but didn’t know anything beyond that.\n\n“There was a lot of ambiguity of what that meant,” he said.\n\nHe told CNN there could be a “silver lining” in the current controversy as it creates a discussion about how social media companies like Facebook use personal information to sell ads.\n\n“The broader question is the elephant in the room,” he said, telling CNN that in exchange for free services like Facebook, users become the product that is sold to advertisers. “Are we concerned with being the product?”\n\nFacebook said in a statement Friday that Kogan, “lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.”\n\nAccording to Facebook, Kogan, “requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app,” which was called “thisisyourdigitallife.”\n\nThe app, “offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.”\n\nAccording to Facebook, “When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.”\n\nRecent information led to the suspension, Facebook said:\n\nSeveral days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information. We are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\n\nAccording to The New York Times and The Guardian, Kogan also obtained data about the friends of those who gave consent to the app, leading to the collection of information from about 50 million others, the bulk of which did not know that their information had been provided to him. About 30 million psychological profiles were built from that data, the newspapers reported.\n\nThe Guardian reports that Cambridge Analytica spent about $1 million to fund Kogan’s effort to harvest the Facebook data. He was allowed to keep a copy of the data for his academic research. Wylie told The Guardian that Kogan was able to get the OK to continue collecting the data from Facebook because he told the company it was only being used for research.\n\nHe told The New York Times that the data was the “saving grace” for Cambridge Analytica’s plan to deliver a way to influence elections through data that the Mercers were seeking.\n\n“We wanted as much as we could get. Where it came from, who said we could have it — we weren’t really asking,” he told The Times.\n\n“They want to fight a culture war in America,” Wylie told the newspaper. “Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war.”\n\nCambridge Analytica previously worked with Senator Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign while the Mercers were backing him. The Guardian revealed in 2015 that Cruz was connected to SCL and Kogan. In March 2017, The Intercept reported that Facebook failed to protect 30 million users from having their data harvested by Global Science Research.\n\nBannon and the Mercers have not commented since The Guardian and The Times reports were published or in the wake of the Facebook suspension. Cambridge Analytica said in a statement:\n\nCambridge Analytica fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is currently in touch with Facebook following its recent statement that it had suspended the company from its platform, in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. Cambridge Analytica’s Commercial and Political divisions use social media platforms for outward marketing, delivering data-led and creative content to targeted audiences. They do not use or hold data from Facebook profiles. In 2014, we contracted a company led by a seemingly reputable academic at an internationally-renowned institution to undertake a large scale research project in the United States. This company, Global Science Research (GSR), was contractually committed by us to only obtain data in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act and to seek the informed consent of each respondent. GSR was also contractually the Data Controller (as per Section 1(1) of the Data Protection Act) for any collected data. GSR obtained Facebook data via an API provided by Facebook. When it subsequently became clear that the data had not been obtained by GSR in line with Facebook’s terms of service, Cambridge Analytica deleted all data received from GSR. We worked with Facebook over this period to ensure that they were satisfied that we had not knowingly breached any of Facebook’s terms of service and also provided a signed statement to confirm that all Facebook data and their derivatives had been deleted.\n\nThe company added, “No data from GSR was used by Cambridge Analytica as part of the services it provided to the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign. Cambridge Analytica only receives and uses data that has been obtained legally and fairly. Our robust data protection policies comply with US, international, European Union, and national regulations.”\n\nYou can read more about Cambridge Analytica at the link below:\n\n2. He Was Born in Moldova, Lived in Moscow Until He Was 7, Moved to the United States & Is Now a U.S. Citizen Living in the Bay Area\n\nKogan was born in Moldova, in the former Soviet Union, and lived in Moscow, Russia, until he was 7, according to The Guardian. He lived in the New York City area and in Bergen County, New Jersey, public records show. He has since become a U.S. citizen.\n\nKogan now lives in the San Francisco Bay area. He briefly changed his name to Aleksandr Spectre after he got married in Singapore. On Facebook, he explained that the name change was not because of negative coverage related to the 2015 article in The Guardian, but as a symbol of their partnership.\n\n“We chose Spectre as a derivative of Spectrum,” he wrote on Facebook. “We wanted to find a last name tied to light because (a) my wife and I are both scientists and quite religious and light is a strong symbol in both, (b) we got married in the international year of light, (c) we are a multi-ethnic family (so multiple colors of the spectrum) and (d) we just thought it sounded really cool. Changing our last name was a symbol of partnership and unity across racial, cultural and philosophical perspectives.”\n\nHis wife is from Singapore and they met at Cambridge University, where she was studying for her Ph.D. He has since gone back to using the name Kogan, and it is not clear if he is still married.\n\n3. Kogan Studied Psychology at Berkeley, Completed His Ph.D at the University of Hong Kong & Became a Lecturer at the Cambridge in 2012\n\nAlex Kogan studied psychology at the University of California Berkeley, graduating in 2008, according to his Linkedin profile. He then completed his Ph.D in psychology at the University of Hong Kong in 2011.\n\nHe spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto and Kogan then began working as an assistant professor at Cambridge University in 2012.\n\nAccording to Cambridge’s Department of Psychology, which uses his Aleksandr Spectre name:\n\nMost broadly, Dr. Spectre’s research focuses on the biology and psychology of human kindness and well-being. To that end, much of his research has centered on exploring prosocial emotional processes, including positive emotions and selflessness, across a variety of intra- and interpersonal contexts. Dr. Spectre uses a diverse set of methodological approaches across psychological, behavioral, genetic, and physiological levels of analysis, employing a multitude of paradigms (dyadic interactions, daily experience, psychophysiological recording, experimental, and thin-slicing), and distinct cultural groups. Presently, Dr. Spectre’s research program focuses on three areas: (a) the biology of prosociality, (b) close relationships and love, and (c) positive emotions and well-being.\n\nHe remains at Cambridge as a senior research associate. According to CNN, Cambridge University said the app used to harvest Facebook data was developed by Kogan’s company, Global Science Research, and it was for commercial, not academic research.\n\nFacebook provided CNN with the description of the app that Kogan submitted in 2014, which read, “This app is part of a research program in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge. We are using this app for research purposes – learning about how people’s Facebook behaviour can be used to better understand their psychological traits, well-being, health, etc and overcome classic problems in social science. Users of the app will be presented with a description of the types of data we gather and the scientific purpose of the data. “Users will be informed that the data will be carefully protected and never used for commercial purposes.”\n\nA university spokesperson told the Cambridge News:\n\nWe are aware that Dr Kogan established his own company, Global Science Research (GSR), of which SCL/Cambridge Analytica was a client. It is not uncommon for Cambridge academics to have business interests, but they must satisfy the university that these are held in a personal capacity and that there are no conflicts of interest. It is our understanding that the thisisyourdigitallife app was created by GSR. Based on assurances from Dr Kogan as well as the evidence available to us, we have no reason to believe he used University data or facilities for his work with GSR, and therefore that there is no reason to believe the University’s data and facilities were used as the basis for GSR’s subsequent work with any other party.\n\nThe spokesperson added, “It is important to make clear that, despite its name, Cambridge Analytica has no connection or association with the university whatsoever.”\n\n4. He Is Also the Founder of a Company Called Philometrics, a ‘Cutting Edge Survey Software Company’ Looking to Combine ‘High End Survey Functionality With Big Data Methods’\n\nKogan now runs a company based in the Bay Area called Philometrics, which describes itself as a “cutting-edge survey software that combines high end survey functionality with big data methods.” The company was founded in 2015.\n\nOn Linkedin, the company writes:\n\nWe are a group of social scientists and computer engineers who are passionate about transforming survey research. Our founders began as academics at the University of Cambridge, working on finding scalable ways to understand how people think. The survey–a 120 year old instrument of choice for most social scientists–became the focus of this work. We found that a combination of big data, machine learning, and survey acumen could lead to remarkable results: Hundreds of thousands of responses to virtually any survey – and at a fraction of the typical cost. Philometrics was founded to help bring our technology to the masses. We are passionate about empowering researchers to do the most cutting edge work they can–and without adding big barriers to entry. Philometrics was built on these ideas. We wanted to be powerful, innovative, fast, and easy to use. We wanted to optimize research through the power of online behavioural big data analysis – from a study of 1000 respondents we aim to give you the insight of 100,000+ people! Our innovative SurveyExtender method produces insight on a revolutionary scale, empowering clients to understand people, markets, and competitors more deeply and accurately than ever before. Philometrics’ team is formed of experienced business analysts and leading academic researchers, all of whom are experienced in helping academics and companies utilize the power of detailed survey insight.\n\nThe company explains on Angel.co, “We were founded by University of Cambridge academics aiming to bring their research on AI-based forecasting of fuzzy traits (e.g., survey responses, interests) to industry. We offer a number of B2B and B2C products and services. Our core software offering, philometrics.com, provides a web do-it-yourself survey building suite with AI superpowers. We also work with a number of commercial partners to help augment their internal insights and collaborate on building consumer apps.”\n\nIn 2014, Kogan gave a talk at the University of Singapore where he bragged about having access to a sample of 50 million individuals for his research:\n\nBig data is increasingly becoming a hot topic in the social sciences, but what is it and why should we care? This talk focuses on answering these questions and suggests that big data is likely to revolutionize how we do our research. I will discuss how big data can be collected, stored, and analyzed, and the types of new insights it can provide to social scientists. I focus specifically on Facebook data and two datasets my lab is currently work with: (a) a sample of 50+ million individuals for whom we have the capacity to predict virtually any trait, and (b) a macro-dataset of every friendship made in the world on Facebook from 2006-2012 by all Facebook users at the national-aggregate level. New empirical findings will focus on prosociality, well-being, and health, though the talk’s central aim is to demonstrate how big data can be applied to traditional social science research questions.\n\n5. Kogan Worked for St. Petersburg State University in Russia, Where His Grandfather Was the Chief of a Physiology School\n\nAlex Kogan has worked for St. Petersburg State University in Russia, according to The Guardian. Kogan did tell the head of the psychology department at Cambridge about his work for the Russian university, the newspaper reports. He took Russian grants to fund research into social media, with one research piece titled, “Stress, health, and psychological wellbeing in social networks: cross-cultural investigation,” according to The Guardian.\n\nCambridge told The Guardian, “We understand that Dr Kogan informed his head of department of discussions with St Petersburg University regarding a collaboration; it was understood that this work and any associated grants would be in a private capacity.”\n\nAccording to The Guardian, Kogan kept his work in Russia private. One colleague told the newspaper, “I am very surprised by that. No one knew.” That work was also not listed on a 10-page CV that Kogan posted on a university website in 2015.\n\nOnline posts show Kogan lecturing in Russian, the newspaper reports, including a talk titled, “New methods of communication as an effective political instrument.”\n\nHe told The Guardian, “Nothing I did on the Russian project was at all related to Cambridge Analytica in any way. No data or mode.”\n\nEditor’s Note: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that Kogan’s grandfather was the chief of a physiology school in Russia and has a neurocybernetics lab named after him there, based on incorrect reporting from another source. We regret the error.",

    "article_text": "In a video published online in September, a social scientist named Alex Spectre made an earnest pitch for his new startup. Clad in the Silicon Valley uniform of open-collar shirt and blazer, Spectre boasted that his company -- Philometrics -- would revolutionize the way online surveys were done, making it easier for companies to design questionnaires that people would actually respond to on Facebook, Twitter or other sites. Crucially, he said, the surveys could predict the responses for large groups from a small number of respondents and micro-target ads better.\n\n\"The reality is working with big data, social media is incredibly difficult,\" said Spectre, who more commonly goes by Aleksandr Kogan, which he uses in his role as a Cambridge University researcher. \"You want to work with people who have a lot of experience. You want to connect with people who have been working with these massive data sets.\"\n\nKogan would know. On Friday, he was suspended by Facebook Inc. for his earlier work mining data on what the New York Times reported was as many as 50 million Facebook users and sharing it with Cambridge Analytica, a political-advertising firm that helped Donald Trump win the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Facebook suspended Kogan over allegations that he lied when he said the data would be used for research purposes only. The social network suspended Cambridge Analytica as well.\n\nThe boyish-appearing Kogan has been thrown into the center of a scandal that has called into question not only the methods the Trump campaign used to psychoanalyze and target potential voters and win the presidency, but also the practices of Silicon Valley companies in allowing third parties to access and exploit private information.\n\nFacebook has since disabled the feature that let Kogan amass personal data on millions of users when less than 1 percent of those people even downloaded his app. But the episode offers a glimpse into how promiscuous some internet giants actually are with information that many users assume is always kept secret. Government officials in the U.S. and Europe are calling for Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to appear in front of lawmakers, and the demands for answers may foreshadow tougher regulation for the social network.\n\nKogan didn’t respond to multiple attempts to reach him for comment. His ill-fated detour from the academic track into the darker corners of social media marketing began in 2014 when U.K.-based Cambridge Analytica turned to Kogan for help. The firm was interested in a data project Kogan had worked on at Cambridge University that was based on research into personality traits and social media.\n\nKogan, who had moved to the U.S. from Russia as a child and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 2008 with a degree in psychology before moving to Hong Kong for his doctorate, ultimately joined Cambridge University in 2012, where he remains a research associate in the psychology department, a position he has retained since relocating back to the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nWhile at Cambridge University, Kogan formed a company in the U.K. called Global Science Research, which created an app called ‘thisisyourdigitallife’ that offered Facebook users personality predictions, in exchange for accessing their personal data on the social network and more limited information about their friends -- including their \"likes\" -- if their privacy settings allowed it. Only about 270,000 people downloaded the app, but the researchers were able to mine the profiles of tens of millions of people through tools Facebook had at the time that gave third parties access to a wide swath of information.\n\nKogan’s company then took the results of those personality surveys and matched them to the users’ actual likes on Facebook -- and the likes of their friends -- to build a model predicting personalities based on digital behavior. The company eventually gave Cambridge Analytica a list of millions of people in the U.S., with their names, locations, genders, ages and predicted test scores.\n\nIn his 2017 video promoting Philometrics, Kogan touted his team’s unique expertise in cracking this code, of predicting the tastes of a large group of people from the responses of a smaller one, which he described as one of the central challenges of doing online research or targeted marketing. \"Social media data is incredible in its opportunities, but it’s also incredibly challenging,\" Kogan said in the video.\n\nUntil 2014, Facebook’s rules let third parties access this back-door channel to friends’ data. That year, the company tightened its privacy settings to \"ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list.\" Facebook has worked to counter the description of what happened as a \"breach,\" but the reality is that the underlying act of data scraping by third parties was not only permitted but encouraged by the social network -- raising questions about how many others abused their access to Facebook user information.\n\nFor its part, Cambridge Analytica said the Facebook data wasn’t used as part of the services it provided to Trump’s presidential campaign, adding that it fully complies with Facebook’s terms of service and is working with the company to resolve the matter.\n\nA person familiar with Kogan’s company’s work last year told Bloomberg News that the methodology and data that it gave to Cambridge Analytica was almost useless in predicting individual personalities, because of a high error rate, and that Cambridge Analytica’s claim of being able to provide behavioral micro-targeting of ads down to the individual level is more marketing bluster than Big Brother.\n\nThe more difficult issue for Facebook is that it had been aware of the controversy over Kogan and Cambridge Analytica’s use of the information since 2015, when Facebook demanded he and Cambridge Analytica delete the data. The social network is now dealing with the fallout of being unable to police how collectors of private Facebook data during that time used the information, and whether they followed Facebook’s rules about sharing or selling it. Facebook is also investigating whether one of its employees, Joseph Chancellor, who formed Global Science Research with Kogan while Chancellor was a doctoral student at Cambridge University, knew about the data leak. Chancellor is now a social-psychology researcher at Facebook. He didn’t respond to a message via LinkedIn seeking comment.\n\nCambridge University said in a statement that it had no evidence to suggest that Kogan had used university resources or facilities for the Global Science Research work, but that it has contacted Facebook requesting \"all relevant evidence in their possession.\"\n\nThe University said that Kogan had sought permission from the head of the psychology department to work with St. Petersburg University on the condition that any grants he received would be \"in a private capacity, separate to his work at University of Cambridge.\"\n\nA person familiar with Kogan’s work says he had a grant that allowed him to do minimal teaching in 2017 and 2018, without specifying the source or nature of the award.\n\nIn 2015, Kogan and his new wife decided to change their last name to something that reflected their belief in both religion and science, and they settled on Spectre, six months before the James Bond film of the same name came out, and long before Russian election meddling dominated the news. A person close to Kogan said the name change had nothing to do with the controversy surrounding his work. \"What person would change their name to a Bond villain,\" the person said, \"to avoid bad press?\"",

    "article_text": "The data scientist who gathered information on millions of Americans for Cambridge Analytica, the controversial data firm that worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, says he would be happy to testify before Congress and speak to the FBI about the work he did for the company. Aleksandr Kogan made the remarks in an email he sent to colleagues at Cambridge University this weekend that was obtained by CNN.\n\n\"I've also seriously been asked if the FBI has reached out, if the two congressional committees in the United States have reached out, and if Parliament or any authorities in the UK have reached out. No one has—I suspect they realize I'm actually not a spy. Though if anyone does, I'd be more than happy to testify and speak candidly about the project,\" he wrote in the email.\n\nKogan's company provided data on millions of Americans to Cambridge Analytica beginning in 2014. The data was gathered through a personality test Facebook application built by Kogan. When Facebook users took the test they gave Kogan access to their data, including demographic information about them like names, locations, ages and genders, as well as their page \"likes,\" and some of their Facebook friends' data.\n\nRelated: Facebook is facing an existential crisis\n\nFacebook says that Kogan told them he was gathering the data for academic purposes and that by providing the data to Cambridge Analytica he had breached Facebook policy. On Friday, Facebook suspended both Kogan and Cambridge Analytica from its platform. The suspension came ahead of reporting in The New York Times and The Observer in London on Saturday that alleged Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data when it was asked to do so by Facebook in 2015 — a claim Cambridge Analytica denies.\n\n\"It's been honestly a surreal week,\" Kogan wrote to his colleagues, \"I've been asked quite seriously by reporters from the NY Times and the Guardian if I am a Russian spy. I really tried to explain that one seems just silly. If I am Russian spy, I am the world's dumbest spy.\"\n\nFacebook has accused Kogan of lying about why he was collecting the data, a claim Kogan disputes in the email, writing, \"we never claimed during the project that it was for academic research. In fact, we did our absolute best not to have the project have any entanglements with the University.\"\n\nKogan said in the email that although he initially used the app for academic purposes, he later updated its terms and conditions on Facebook and said it clearly stated that users were granting Kogan the right to sell and license the data. \"Facebook at no point raised any concerns at all about any of these changes,\" he wrote.\n\nFacebook says that Kogan's app description initially read, \"This app is part of a research program in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge.\" Facebook says that Kogan did not inform it when he changed the app's purpose from academic to commercial, and that he should have informed the company directly.\n\nIn the email obtained by CNN, Kogan said he provided \"predicted personality scores\" on 30 million Americans to SCL, Cambridge Analytica's parent company. But he then downplayed the value of his work, saying the predictions themselves were not useful for targeting advertising to users based on their interests. \"[W]e found out that the predictions we gave SCL were 6 times more likely to get all 5 of a person's personality traits wrong as it was to get them all correct,\" he wrote.\n\nAsked by CNN through a spokesperson for Cambridge University whether he had sent the email, Kogan did not dispute that he had.\n\nKogan, who still works for Cambridge University, now runs an online survey company. The company, Philometrics, says it uses artificial intelligence to forecast people's views on various issues.\n\nCambridge University said in a statement, \"It is important to make clear that, despite its name, Cambridge Analytica has no connection or association with the University whatsoever.\" Cambridge has also said it has no reason to believe that Kogan used university data or facilities in his work with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCambridge Analytica said in a statement Saturday that when it became clear to the company that Kogan had not gathered the data in line with Facebook's terms of service it deleted all the data he had provided.",

Tadas Jucikas and Brent Clickard, former close colleagues of Chris Wylie, the man who blew the whistle on Cambridge Analytica, founded Genus AI in May 2016 as an artificial intelligence company that “integrates 3rd party as well as 1st party data sources and applies proprietary insights and algorithms to unlock the value hidden in data,” according to its website. Some of those techniques were ostensibly shaped by their time at Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Group, where they, along with Wylie, pioneered practices that would form the basis of the data mining outfit, which is currently under fire.\n\nCambridge Analytica is at the center of a media and political maelstrom, having been accused by Wylie of misappropriating the data of more than 50 million Facebook users. Government officials on both sides of the Atlantic are now trying to determine to what extent that data played a role in advising the company’s clients, particularly Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the Leave.EU (Brexit) campaign, on their paths to electoral victories in 2016. Facebook, meanwhile, is in crisis as questions swirl about what it knew of Cambridge Analytica’s actions. And the birth of the new firm suggests that the hubbub around the political consulting firm is the mere tip of an enormous iceberg that touches the core of the social network’s business. Wylie, who revealed his role in the creation of “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool” to the Observer and the New York Times last week, worked closely with Jucikas and Clickard at SCL’s elections division; the three had planned to leave the firm to start their own company in 2014, according to documents viewed by BuzzFeed News. They were unable to do so, hampered by agreements with SCL, said a source familiar with the situation, and their idea for a company eventually became Cambridge Analytica, a joint venture between SCL and Robert Mercer, an American hedge fund magnate and Trump patron. “Cambridge Analytica was founded on misappropriated data of at least 50 million Facebook users and I want to bring attention to that so that people understand that their data is being used improperly by this company,” Wylie said in an interview on NBC’s Today show on Monday. “...And it’s really important, I think, to find out: Was this data used to elect Donald Trump?” SCL’s elections division, using social media data, third-party information from data brokers, and machine learning algorithms, was trying to build “psychographic profiles” — a comprehensive view of how an individual is likely to feel about a given issue, as well as the way they’re inclined to vote — of entire countries to model events on entire populations and predict markets, a source familiar told BuzzFeed News. Workers for SCL sometimes bragged about influencing events in nations like Trinidad and Tobago as well as Ghana, that person said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSCL was able to do that, in part, because of data collected by Cambridge University data scientist Aleksandr Kogan. Through his company Global Science Research, Kogan built and used a personality quiz Facebook application to collect data, including Facebook page likes, location, and basic personal information, from millions of Americans throughout 2014. The application also collected the data of users' Facebook friends, reportedly expanding the network of 270,000 app users who gave express permission to roughly 50 million unwitting individuals. That data was later improperly handed off to Cambridge Analytica. Jucikas and Clickard, who make no mention of their time at SCL or their role in founding Cambridge Analytica on their LinkedIn profiles, did not respond to BuzzFeed News’ requests for comment. A since-deleted profile for \"Tadas Jucikas\" on F6S, a social platform for startup founders, reads \"I helped create Cambridge Analytica which played a role in Donald Trump [sic] presidential election.” Both Jucikas’s and Genus AI’s Twitter accounts have been dormant in the last week. The company removed a link on its website that navigated to a team page with bios for Genus’s executives after BuzzFeed News sent emails to its founders on Monday. Wylie also did not return multiple requests for comment. While Wylie has gone public, his former colleagues have remained quiet and are still attempting to capitalize on the skills they honed while at SCL. In addition to Genus, Jucikas, who shared an apartment for a time with Wylie, created another research company and is an adviser for an energy startup that employs artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, Clickard, apart from cofounding Genus, serves as a data science consultant at a workplace analytics firm and has done work for a survey research firm with Kogan and another data scientist who originally harvested and provided Cambridge Analytica with its contentious Facebook data trove. In an email sent to BuzzFeed News after publication of this article, Jucikas said \"Genus does not have – nor has ever had – access to the Facebook data set,\" adding that \"as business we do not use Facebook customer data to drive insight.\" Clickard did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When BuzzFeed News paid a visit to Genus AI's West London headquarters, company officials, communicating through a receptionist, refused to talk and referred all inquiries to email. At a San Francisco address listed on the company’s website, a security guard said that the suite Genus claimed to have occupied had been vacated by its tenants in the last month. BuzzFeed News also visited a Washington, DC, address for the company, though there was also no one in that office. A building manager attempted to alert the company that BuzzFeed News was looking for them.\n\nA spokesperson for Facebook, which said on Monday that it is hiring a third-party firm to audit Cambridge Analytica, did not return a request for comment. Cambridge Analytica, whose CEO Alexander Nix said in a February parliamentary hearing that his firm did not work with Facebook data, released a statement on Saturday contradicting that, but claimed the company had deleted the GSR-obtained social network information after it had learned that the information violated Facebook’s term of service. On Monday, UK authorities sought warrants to raid Cambridge Analytica’s offices and seize its servers and documents. While Wylie left the company in late 2014, it’s less clear if Clickard or Jucikas, both of whom have doctorate degrees from Cambridge University, still maintain any working relationship with the eponymous data mining firm. In late 2013, while working for SCL, the trio had begun to think about how to start their own venture separate from their employer. Jucikas and Wylie, who were roommates at the time, as well as Clickard, eventually developed a pitch for a company they called Arg.us, according to documents seen by BuzzFeed News. After exploring the possibility of raising $15 million from venture capital investors, the group eventually realized that it wouldn’t be impossible to take the property and research they had developed at SCL with them to their new venture. Arg.us served as a precursor for Cambridge Analytica, according to a source familiar with the situation.\n\nWithout Wylie, Jucikas and Clickard founded Genus AI in May 2016 and announced in a blog post that it had raised $1 million in seed funding in October 2017 from a Berlin-based venture fund and a collection of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. “We are a team of data scientists, engineers and marketing experts passionate about harnessing the power of AI for consumer outreach and communications,” reads the company’s website. “Backed by a group of top investors we've set out to change the way we understand and interact with people around the world.” Genus’s site says little about its clients, though a company blog post says the startup has already built an “anti-fraud framework” for a car-hiring company and used population data insights to “inform policy changes at government departments.” The company also hired Jesse Kamzol, the chief data officer at the Republican National Committee from February 2015 to August 2017, as its head of data. Despite this, Genus seems to have kept a low profile in Washington. Two prominent GOP figures told BuzzFeed News they had not heard of the company, while its executives have been careful not to mention any role in election work on social media. Among the company’s leader, only Clickard has any public statement of his time in politics. In a short February 2016 YouTube video published by the management consultancy company the Chemistry Group, where Clickard was employed until July 2016, the former SCL employee discusses his involvement working in politics. “The coolest thing I’ve worked on in the past is probably using personality data to personalize communication across several US Senate campaigns,” he said. Some members of Genus AI's small team are connected to not only Wylie, but also to Kogan and his cofounder at Global Science Research, Alex Slinger. Clickard worked for Kogan's current venture, Philometrics, a survey research company that claims to use \"online behavioural big data analysis.\" It's unclear if Clickard still works for Philometrics in any capacity. While he has two blog posts on an archived version of its website, and is listed in other documents, his most recent company blog post for Philometrics is from November 2015. Philometrics does not appear in Clickard's past work history under his LinkedIn profile. Many of Genus AI's employees are also currently involved in other data and psychology ventures, in some cases starting overlapping companies with other Genus AI staffers. Jucikas and Genus AI's technology adviser, Tobias Kloepper, cofounded a data company called Whitehat Analytics. According to online domain registration records, Whitehat Analytics registered a website for Our Values, an organization dedicated to engaging veterans in politics that was started by two Trump campaign supporters in October 2017. Kloepper himself is also currently serving as an executive of a third company, Aigenpulse, an analytics platform for scientific data, where he is CEO. In addition, Jucikas is also listed as an adviser to WePower, a “blockchain-based green energy trading platform.” A white paper for its cryptocurrency notes that his “vast experience includes advising the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Education with the UK Government on data science, machine learning, and AI.” There is no mention of SCL or Cambridge Analytica. ●\n\nMark Di Stefano in London and Sarah Mimms in Washington, DC, contributed additional reporting to this story.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan Mac is a senior technology reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco.

    "article_text": "In the 1980s, when we were toiling in the high-tech vineyards as an unfunded mom-and-pop startup, this quip was making the rounds:\n\n\n\nIf you look around the table and don’t know who the sucker is, it’s you.\n\n\n\nTurns out this maxim originated with poker sharks, but it works for tech too.\n\n\n\nIn the dustup around Cambridge Analytica, Dr. Alexandr Borisovich Kogan, Facebook and Facebook users, it’s hard to figure out exactly who’s the sucker.\n\n\n\nLet’s work our way back to figure it out.\n\nI’d be willing to concede that there’s a fair percentage of suckers in the Facebook user group. As someone who’s been around the software industry since before there was an Internet and even before personal computers, from a technical perspective I’ve never expected that anything I put online was my enduring secret. It’s just too easy to copy code, and after that too hard to control where it goes. Genie back in bottle, etc.\n\nCould Facebook, represented by founder Mark Zuckerberg, be the sucker? Surely not, such a Harvard-admitted Prize Boy must know what he’s doing? If he thought he was protecting the user information he was collecting, should his heartfelt apology be accepted?\n\nWell, when I was a manager in a software company, my motto was that “anyone who believes a programmer deserves what they get.” That quip usually applied to those wild under-estimates by programmers (now elevated to “software engineers”) about when their projects would be finished, but I’m sure it could also apply to guesses by Facebook managers about how secure their data is.\n\n“Not very” is almost always the true answer. Zuckerberg surely knew and still knows that.\n\nAnd yet… contracts. Those who have access to Facebook data must promise not to use it in the wrong way (whatever that might mean), right?\n\nYeah sure. My law school Contracts professor hammered on one slogan, perhaps the only thing I remember from that class after some 40 years: “What’s your remedy?” If a licensee has done wrong with your data, what can you do about it after the fact?\n\nSadly, the usual answer is my favorite Yiddish word, bupkes….nada..nothing. Or as close as makes no difference.\n\nBecause money, because time, because a whole bunch of variables can’t be controlled. Lawsuits for breach of contracts like these are very rare, and only happen when the stakes are much higher and the parties are equally matched before they square off.\n\nSo then, was there evil intent disguised as naiveté on the part of the academic who had access to Facebook’s user data and sold / gave it away to a for-profit company? Some commentators though so, but maybe he’s really as clueless as he claims to be.\n\nFrom The Guardian’s profile of the conduit between Facebook and Cambridge Analytica:\n\n“Aleksandr Kogan, a Moldovan-born researcher from Cambridge University, admits harvesting the personal details of 30 million Facebook users via a personality app he developed…While at Cambridge Kogan accepted a position at St Petersburg State University, and also took Russian government grants for research.\n\n“Kogan laughed off suspicions that he is linked to the Kremlin. He said: “This one is pretty funny … anyone who knows me knows I’m a very happy-go-lucky goofy guy, the last one to have any real links to espionage.”\n\nWhen this story started to heat up, the Internet was awash in speculation about the mysterious professor who had somehow delivered Facebook users to the Trump campaign. Much of this was perhaps fueled by the guy’s propensity to use different names and personas.\n\nAccording to his Tumblr profile, there’s even a Berkeley connection:\n\n“I have been a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge since 2012 and the founder/CEO of Philometrics.com since 2015. Much of my research focuses on well-being and kindness, but more recently, I’ve been interested in understanding how we can scale survey research without scaling the costs.\n\n“I received my BA in psychology from UC Berkeley in 2008 and a PhD from the University of Hong Kong in 2011. Before going to Cambridge, I worked as a postdoc at the University of Toronto.\n\n“Born in the Soviet Union, I split my childhood half there and half in NYC where my family immigrated. I currently live in the Bay Area.”\n\nNo online clue to where he lives now, though quotes in stories seem to reference Cambridge. WhitePages.com reports an address in El Sobrante in December of 2017.\n\nAbout his name(s). For most of the time, the one he’s used most often, Aleksandr Borisovich Kogan, shows that he’s still got one foot in the former USSR. “Borisovich”, only sometimes included, is his patronymic, not his middle name, and is a version of his father’s given name. His last name, Kogan, is simply a Russian-style transliteration of the common name most English-speakers render as Cohen. Yet on Tumblr he’s called Alex Spectre and at Cambridge he’s been known previously as Dr. Aleksandr Spectre, per his CV as a Psychology Department Research Associate.\n\nThe name Spectre seems to have originated with his marriage.\n\nHeavy.com found this explanation on, yes, Facebook: “We chose Spectre as a derivative of Spectrum…We wanted to find a last name tied to light because (a) my wife and I are both scientists and quite religious and light is a strong symbol in both, (b) we got married in the international year of light, (c) we are a multi-ethnic family (so multiple colors of the spectrum) and (d) we just thought it sounded really cool. Changing our last name was a symbol of partnership and unity across racial, cultural and philosophical perspectives.”\n\nBut his recent return to “Kogan” might be explained by this item found in California court records, which looks like a sad outcome to a touching tale:\n\n“On 04/10/2017 a Family - Marriage Dissolution/Divorce case was filed by Crystal Ying Spectre against Aleksandr Spectre in the jurisdiction of Contra Costa County Superior Courts…”\n\nIf he’d been plain old Alex Cohen all along instead of experimenting with names, he might have avoided a lot of unnecessary drama in media reports of the Cambridge Analytica affair.\n\nIt’s not clear amidst all the online debris surrounding his various soubriquets what he actually has been doing for the last few years. A wistful 2017 blog post, The Ph.D.’s dilemma: Academia or Industry?, reveals a bad case of start-up envy which he eventually acted upon.\n\nHe wore his academic hat to glean potentially valuable user data from Facebook which he sold to Analytica, which they then peddled to the oligarchic Mercer family to deploy on behalf of a couple of pet candidates, first Ted Cruz and then Donald Trump. The content in these transactions at this point looks an awful lot like junk science, especially as packaged, branded and marketed by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nIn the Guardian interview, Kogan himself poo-pooed the value of what he’d sold:\n\n“The accuracy of this data has been extremely exaggerated. In practice my best guess is that we were six times more likely to get everything wrong about a person as we were to get everything right about a person. I personally don’t think micro-targeting is an effective way to use such data sets.”\n\n“It could have only hurt the campaign. What Cambridge Analytica has tried to sell is magic. And it made claims that this is incredibly accurate and it tells you everything there is to tell about you, but the reality is that it’s not that. If you really work through the statistics … those claims quickly fall apart.”\n\nSo it was just a lot of cleverly merchandised snake oil?\n\nWell, let’s get back to that Berkeley connection.\n\nIn my old email I found a link to a 2011 UC Berkeley press release with this lead:\n\n“There’s definitely something to be said for first impressions. New research from the University of California, Berkeley, suggests it can take just 20 seconds to detect whether a stranger is genetically inclined to being trustworthy, kind or compassionate.”\n\nReally?\n\nThe lead author of the study was Aleksandr Kogan, a postdoctoral student at the University of Toronto at Mississauga. Co-authors came from his undergraduate alma mater, U.C. Berkeley. Kogan quote: “It’s remarkable that complete strangers could pick up on who’s trustworthy, kind or compassionate in 20 seconds when all they saw was a person sitting in a chair listening to someone talk.”\n\nIndeed it is.\n\nI haven’t checked, but I doubt that this study has been replicated. I’m a believer in Dr. Joyce Friedman’s rule of psychology results: “if it’s not intuitively obvious, it’s wrong.”\n\nIt’s a field that attracts snake oil peddlers. Let’s just say that a whole lot of psychology results can’t be replicated for whatever reason . See, further, Wikipedia on the replication crisis in psychology.\n\nIf Kogan knew that it was snake oil, and Cambridge Analytica probably did too, who’s the mark at this table? Maybe it was the Mercer family, though Robert Mercer made his fortune doing fancy math for hedge funds and should have been able to figure this one out.\n\nOf course, the pilfered Facebook data could have been mostly wrong but still right enough to tip the scales in 2016. It’s possible that Mercer et al. accurately assessed the small number of voters in the three key states who gave Trump their electoral votes by narrow majorities fueled by tailored “fake news” on Facebook.\n\nIt’s a close call, but my candidate for the suckers in 2016 are all those trusting souls who endow commercial social media of all sorts with their intimate personal and political data. I’m reminded of the story of King Midas’s barber, who whispered into some reeds that Apollo had turned the king’s ears into ass’s ears, and the reeds amplified the story far and wide. If you don’t want it spread around, keep it to yourself.\n\nAnd while we’re on the subject of misplaced trust, the City of Berkeley is now inveigling residents to record their opinions on hot topics with an online app called here, “Berkeley Considers”. Yes, yes, I know it comes with effusive guarantees of anonymity, but it would be oh-so-easy to hack. Voters, citizens, residents should tell their councilmembers and the city staff that they express themselves when they vote by secret ballot in the real elections, period. Quasi-scientific polls like this one are garbage.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nAmusing P.S.: when I was googling around with Kogan’s name on a rainy day to figure out what all these clowns were up to, I came upon this example question on a translation website:\n\n“Нужно было вам оставаться в Сан-Франциско, доктор Коган. You should have stayed in San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.”\n\nGood advice—if he’d followed it his professional reputation might have been in better shape today.",

    "article_text": "The difference between what FEC records show and what SCL Elections declared as earned from Cambridge Analytica LLC per filed accounts raises important questions.\n\nIn my last story about Cambridge Analytica, I suggested that where there are doubts, those charged with due diligence should “dig, dig and dig again.” That’s what I’ve been doing, piecing together the numbers as best I can from official sources.\n\nLast time out, I quoted from SCL Elections Ltd accounts, (PDF) where I noted:\n\nThe Company owns a 19.0% share in Cambridge Analytica LLC, a US entity in which Alexander Nix is a board member. £24.2m (2015: £12.4m) income was received from this entity during the year and no costs were due by the Company in respect of losses incurred by the entity. There was no cost of this investment. At the year-end, the Company was owed £869,595 (2015: £922,440) by this entity.\n\nThose numbers have been bugging me, largely because the mainstream media has been quoting very different figures in respect of campaign expenditures to the U.S. business Cambridge Analytica LLC. Remember that we are told Cambridge Analytica is largely a data research business but that it also provides some media work, presumably digital consulting and advertising.\n\nFinancial discrepancies\n\nFederal Election Commission Filings show that between 1st January 2015 and 31st December 2016 Cambridge Analytica LLC received a total of $15.4 million. That’s split as to $5.6 million in 2015 and $9.8 million in 2016. There are no receipts recorded for 2017 and beyond.\n\nThe 2015 figure refers to various campaigns, notably that of Ted Cruz and John Bolton Super PAC. The 2016 figures include receipts from Donald J. Trump For President Inc. amounting to $5.9 million, all of which refer to ‘data management’ services but which includes a single figure of $5 million, paid 1st September 2016. There are references to media activity totaling just shy of $2 million with the remainder referenced as ‘campaign management consulting’ of $903,000 and a variety of other research activities making up the balance.\n\nSo where did the rest of the money SCL Elections received from Cambridge Analytica LLC come from and how much are we talking about? The total dollar value is hard to estimate with precision since exchange rates varied in those years but an average rate for each year implies total of $19 million (2015) and $32 million (2016.)\n\nThe Giles-Parscale connection\n\nThe best guess for sources in 2016 is via Giles-Parscale, the digital media vendor that led the Trump campaign’s digital media outreach in 2016.\n\nThe reason I conclude this is because reports talk about a close relationship between Parscale and Matt Oczkowski, then Cambridge’s head of product. According to the Washington Post, that company earned $94 million but FEC filings say it was closer to $87.8 million, a discrepancy of $6.2 million that I believe is made up of payments recorded as between early November 2016 and the end of the year.\n\nThe amounts paid to Giles-Parscale represent website development of $24,000, digital consulting of $2.5 million and $85.2 million in ‘digital consulting and online advertising.’\n\nThere is little doubt that Cambridge and Parscale worked hand in hand for at least some of the 2016 period but the financial extent is unknown and the extent to which Cambridge was a subcontractor is equally unknown. This from Wired provides the best available clues:\n\nParscale describes the firm’s work this way: “As I’ve said multiple times over prior statements, Matt Oczkowski and his team created a daily tracker of polling, so that I could see how Trump was doing in key swing states. They provided that to me daily.” Parscale says Cambridge also helped the campaign with what he calls “persuasion online media buying. They also helped us identify potential donors. And they created a visualization tool that showed in each state which areas were most persuadable and what those voters care about.”\n\nBut then the report goes on to confuse matters saying:\n\nCambridge Analytica was paid $5.9 million by the Trump campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings, $5 million of which went toward buying television ads, with the remainder going to pay Oczkowski and his team.\n\nThat’s not what the FEC says, referring to all monies paid as for ‘data management’ services.\n\nOther sources?\n\nCould there be other sources for both 2015 and 2016 that were funneled through the American organization?\n\nWe know from reports that Alexander Nix, the (then) CEO of Cambridge Analytica LLC and the owner of 70% of SCL Elections was touting all manner of government and election-related contracts in early 2017. But there have been plenty of doubts placed on those claims, despite Nix claiming:\n\n…the push (towards winning government work) is an extension of the work the company has done as a subcontractor on a variety of government projects during the last 14 years — and that SCL would have sought the new work no matter who had won the election.\n\nIf that is true, then it seems odd that U.S. government offices would contemplate commercial arrangements with a U.S. business, ostensibly run by a non-U.S. national who controls 70% of the non-U.S. based company that received so much from the U.S. operation.\n\nThat brings us back to the earnings gap.\n\nHow does Facebook figure?\n\nAccording to The Guardian:\n\nParscale said the campaign constantly tested minute variations in the design, color, background and phrasing of Facebook ads, in order to maximize their impact. Typically 50,000 to 60,000 variations were tested each day, he said, and sometimes as many as 100,000.\n\nParscale said that much of this work was done with the help of Facebook employees ’embedded’ in his business. For its part, Facebook said it showed Parscale how to use the Facebook ad platform alongside voter registration data but that was about all they did.\n\nTesting of ads is certainly the purview of the digital marketing agency. But that can only be successfully achieved when you have data and data models that allow for this level of experimentation. That could have come from a variety of sources including that which fueled the original Cambridge/SCL models that are at the heart of the original controversy about the use of Facebook data. If correct, then it’s not unreasonable that Cambridge/SCL would expect fees for that data/model usage, even though Cambridge had already been paid by the Donal J.Trump For President organization.\n\nWhere to now?\n\nWe are told that Robert Mercer invested $5 million in Cambridge Analytica in 2016. Was that a direct investment as in cash to bank or routed via a PAC? We don’t know. We also know Mercer bankrolled Breitbart, the media business controlled by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon who was also a Cambridge Analytica board member until his August 2016. It’s not inconceivable that Breitbart paid Cambridge Analytica for data services.\n\nInvestigations are ongoing into Cambridge Analytica on both sides of the Atlantic. We will eventually learn how the story of the 2016 election was won played out and whether, among other things, the work Nix performed was in violation of U.S. election law.\n\nToday, we can only speculate but it is reasonable to assume that Cambridge Analytica LLC was the recipient of far more by way of campaign funds than appears on the surface, most likely via Giles-Parscale.

    "article_text": "The data on millions of Facebook users that a firm wrongfully swiped from the social network has likely spread to other groups, databases and the dark web, experts said, making company's pledge to safeguard its users’ privacy hard to enforce.\n\nChief executive Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this week that it would notify users whose data might have been taken by Cambridge Analytica, a political marketing firm that worked for the Trump campaign. Cambridge Analytica obtained the data of an estimated 50 million users in 2014 and 2015 under false pretences, breaking Facebook’s rules. Mr Zuckerberg said that the world’s biggest social network has taken steps to ensure data on millions of its users does not get into the wrong hands.\n\nBut Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a privacy expert and co-founder of PersonalData.IO, said he suspects the data has already proliferated far beyond Cambridge Analytica’s reach. “It is the whole nature of this ecosystem,” Mr Dehaye said. “This data travels. And once it has spread there is no way to get it back.”\n\nMr Zuckerberg added that Facebook will investigate and audit thousands of third-party developers. Third-party apps could access data on Facebook users and their friends until 2015, when Facebook changed its rules. Experts question whether the network’s push to investigate and audit thousands of third-party developers will merit any true results. Mr Dehaye questioned how Facebook would define which apps merit investigation and what would constitute “suspicious activity”.\n\nFacebook said that it conducts manual and automated checks to verify developers comply with its policies. It also plans to expand its bug bounty programme to report misuse of data.\n\nMr Zuckerberg said in interviews that the company is investigating reports that independent researchers and dark web data brokers are trading user data grabbed by the firm Cambridge Analytica.\n\nFrank Pasquale, a University of Maryland professor who specialises in algorithms and tech ethics, called this “the runaway data problem” and said there is no way to return the genie to the bottle when it comes to securing data that’s already been released. Location and demographic information, like the data taken from Facebook, can often be used to tie someone to other data points where the identity was previously unclear.\n\n“The larger data sets you get about individuals, the easier it is to use those to reidentify them in data sets where they think they’re anonymous,” professor Pasquale said. “With a relatively small amount of data points, you can infer an incredible amount of very personal information about people.”\n\nFacebook does not know whether other companies have shared or mishandled user data and a forensic audit is ongoing, Mr Zuckerberg told Wired magazine. Asked by Wired how confident he was that Facebook data had not gotten into the hands of Russian operatives or other groups, Mr Zuckerberg said, “I can’t really say that. I hope that we will know that more certainly after we do an audit.”\n\nFor many of Facebook’s prime growth years, the company gave outside developers access to virtually everything that a user who authorised an app or her friends, had posted on the social network: her home town, current city, events and location check-ins; her interests, groups and all the pages she’d liked; her relationship statuses with romantic partners, friends and family; her birthday, activities, work history and political and religious affiliations and her photos, notes and videos.\n\nFacebook changed its rules in 2015 amid concerns over how the data was being used. But for years, other developers had the power to construct the same kinds of massive micro-targeted databases that had helped make Facebook so prominent. It’s unclear how many other services used that power or what they have done with the data pulled.\n\nMr Zuckerberg said the company will “investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information” before the rule change, a number he said would likely be in the thousands. The company, he added, “will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity” and said the company would likely need to hire more workers to complete the audits. “We want to make sure that there aren’t other Cambridge Analyticas out there,” he told Wired.\n\nThe data shared with Cambridge Analytica was taken via a personality quiz, called ThisIsYourDigitalLife, that was initially approved by Facebook for research purposes.\n\nWorld news in pictures 50 show all World news in pictures 1/50 7 June 2018 Russian President Vladimir Putin listens to a question during his annual call-in show in Moscow.

AFP/Getty/www.cubadebate.cu\n\nIt’s unclear how Facebook would know how to find or recover users’ data. The data taken by the researcher Dr Aleksandr Kogan, who provided it to Cambridge Analytica, “wasn’t watermarked in anyway,” Mr Zuckerberg told Wired. “And if he passed along data to Cambridge Analytica that was some kind of derivative data based on personality scores or something, we wouldn’t have known that or ever seen that data.”\n\nIn the same year that Facebook severed ties with him, Dr Kogan also started his own San Francisco-based survey data firm, Philometrics, raising questions about whether he took the Facebook data with him and used for commercial purposes. (Dr Kogan did not reply to repeated requests for comment).\n\nApps and start-ups that grabbed user data over a number of years, Mr Dehaye said, often hand over their data if they’re acquired by another company or sell their data sets if they close or liquidate.\n\nFacebook opened the door to developers in 2007 in hopes of expanding Facebook’s reach across the web by making it easier for other sites to connect with the sprawling connective maps Facebook uses to link people by relationships and tastes, known as its “social graph” and “interest graph”.\n\nMarketing firms have spent tens of millions of dollars to learn similar information – including compiling consumer surveys and purchasing massive consumer files from data brokers such as Experian and Acxiom – all of which came from different sources and had varying ages, precision and usefulness. Facebook’s wealth of data, on the other hand, was packed with detailed information volunteered by users themselves and offered completely free until the rule change took effect in 2015.\n\nFacebook, Mr Zuckerberg said, will now restrict the data that third-party developers can access to names, profile photos and email addresses and will require developers to sign a contract before being allowed to ask users for rights to their posts.\n\nFacebook said it will ban developers who misuse its data.\n\nThe sheer size of the data pulled from Facebook, experts say, is powerful on its own – and could prove valuable for marketers, political campaigns or other groups seeking to target users en masse.\n\n“Getting good data on 50 million people from a relatively neutral, nonpartisan source that is diversely spread and not just clustered in one tiny segment of the social graph – that’s a big deal,” said Matthew Hindman, a George Washington University associate professor who researches online campaigning and internet politics. “If you can see that many people’s activity on Facebook, you can guess pretty accurately what their partisanship might be, no matter how good your model is.”\n\nThe Washington Post",

    "article_text": "While attention is being paid to Cambridge Analytica, the focus is misplaced. This story explains why and why due diligence is vital in your dealings.\n\nLiam O’Hare at Bellacaledonia has done a first-rate job investigating the ties between Cambridge Analytica, the British political establishment and espionage services. (hat tip to James Governor)\n\nO’Hare uncovers a web of connections between powerful politicians, the people who run Cambridge Analytica, SCL and its primary trading group member SCL Elections Ltd.\n\nFor my part, I’ve been digging around in the Companies House records to figure out who owns what and what those companies do. The trading results are interesting and I’ll get to those in a moment.\n\nReported facts\n\nFirst, it is important to ask whether the reported suspension of Alexander Nix, CEO is real or imagined. CNN, The Guardian and the BBC are all reporting the suspension. From The Guardian:\n\nThe company said in a statement: “The board of Cambridge Analytica has announced today that it has suspended CEO Alexander Nix with immediate effect pending a full, independent investigation. “In the view of the board, Mr Nix’s recent comments secretly recorded by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm and his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.” Cambridge Analytica said its chief data officer, Alexander Tayler, had been appointed acting chief executive while an investigation was carried out by Julian Malins QC, whose findings they would “share publicly in due course”. “The board will be monitoring the situation closely, working closely with Dr Tayler, to ensure that Cambridge Analytica, in all of its operations, represents the firm’s values and delivers the highest-quality service to its clients.”\n\nThe real facts\n\nSo far, so good. But documents filed at Companies House paint a different picture.\n\nCambridge Analytica UK Limited is controlled by SCL Elections Ltd which in turn is controlled by SCL Analytics Ltd. Nix is named as directors of all three companies. But it gets a tad more complex at this point because SCL Analytics is recorded as partially owned by SCL Group. Accounts filed show that SCL Group owns 30% of SCL Analytics with Nix owning the other 70%.\n\nThe SCL Group board comprises Nix and three others. the exact ownership structure of SCL Group is unknown since the company expanded its share capital significantly in February, 2018 and has yet to file a statement setting out who owns what.\n\nThis begs the question – who constitutes the board of Cambridge Analytica UK Limited when currently available company records say that Nix both directly and indirectly controls that company?\n\nFollow the money\n\nFollowing the money inside a privately held UK company is never easy because while UK legislation requires all companies to file annual accounts, the amount of information required to be disclosed is limited by a variety of exemptions. However, we can glean some insights from reported figures.\n\nIt seems that in U.S. election year, SCL Elections had a good year,showing retained profits increased from just shy of £380,000 to £2.39 million. The latest available accounts for SCL Elections, for the year to 31st December 2016 (PDF) state:\n\nThe Company owns a 19.0% share in Cambridge Analytica LLC, a US entity in which Alexander Nix is a board member. £24.2m (2015: £12.4m) income was received from this entity during the year and no costs were due by the Company in respect of losses incurred by the entity. There was no cost of this investment. At the year-end, the Company was owed £869,595 (2015: £922,440) by this entity.\n\nWhile most media reports refer to Cambridge Analytica, as O’Hare points out, it is SCL Elections where the action is. Accounts for Cambridge Analytica UK show that it didn’t trade. (PDF)\n\nAnother company, SCL Social Ltd, which is owned by SCL Analytics and provides data services to commercial organizations, also did rather well, (PDF) raising retained earnings from £174,000 to a just under £1 million. The company made an inferred profit of around £870,000 and was owed £1.1 million from group undertaking, presumably SCL Analytics. SCL Social states that its primary business is that of research and communications.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is that SCL Elections is heavily implicated in election interference, principally via Facebook. But if that company relied upon services from SCL Social, then what does that say about tactics used by commercial organizations in furtherance of their social marketing tactics?\n\nThe Mercer connection\n\nLooking through the various accounts and company records. it is clear that SCL is a fluid group where structures and activities are shunted between companies that appear to trade at modest scale for a couple of years before activity is moved elsewhere.\n\nFor example, a new company, Emerdata was formed late 2017 with Alexander Nix as one of the directors. Guess who else is on the board? None other than Rebekah Anne Mercer, who is widely thought of as at the center of the Trump election campaign who is also the daughter of billionaire Robert Mercer, who bankrolled Breitbart when Steve Bannon was running the show. Rebekah’s sister, Jennifer is also on the board. Emerdata reports its activities as ‘Data processing, hosting and related activities,’ whatever that means.\n\nMy take\n\nWhen a company’s business is to show deception then you have to dig into statements, assuming that there is misdirection along the way. When you discover that operations are fluid and that external actors who are already associated with acquisitions of election tampering, then, as Nix said in The Guardian article:\n\nLooks can be deceptive.\n\nOnce again, we have an example of a business where due diligence is useful because if your business is seeking to influence buying outcomes, then it’s useful to know who is pulling the strings before someone else finds out.\n\nIn short, if there are any doubts then dig, dig and dig again.\n\nImage credit - via The Daily Kos",

    "article_text": "Aleksandr Kogan, the Cambridge University academic whose app has set off the firestorm about online user data, says he’s considering suing Facebook.\n\nLONDON — Aleksandr Kogan wants to set the record straight. “I am not a Russian spy,” he tells BuzzFeed News aboard a Saturday evening flight to the British capital. On Tuesday, the Cambridge University researcher is set to testify here in front of a parliamentary committee that is looking to determine whether the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica influenced global elections and the United Kingdom’s Brexit vote. At the hearing, Kogan, who’s been accused of being a foreign agent, an unscrupulous scholar, and a mind manipulator, hopes to dispel the myths about himself and the data he collected from millions of Facebook users and handed to Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Elections. While Kogan has spoken little since the Observer and the New York Times ran stories last month identifying him as the individual behind a leak of data from more than 50 million Facebook users, the 32-year-old psychologist granted BuzzFeed News a series of interviews ahead of his parliament appearance this week. In those conversations, he admitted that he did violate Facebook’s developer policy by harvesting user data and transferring it to a third party — but said that he was being unfairly pilloried as just one of many people who did this. In following up on the controversy, Facebook has vowed to find them all. As he attempts to shift the narrative away from his own actions, Kogan maintained that observers have missed the big story: that companies have been collecting data on users for years using Facebook’s tools and tacit understanding. Kogan also disputes other aspects of the established narrative: that he’s a spy, for one, but also that Cambridge Analytica was capable of predicting individual behavior, that his relationship with Facebook was brief and casual, and that whistleblower Christopher Wylie had extensive knowledge about the data. “Folks are only concerned right now about the story because they think it could have swung the elections or that they can be mind controlled, and that’s not a real worry,” Kogan said, labeling claims that Cambridge Analytica had effective behavior prediction models as “nonsense.” The real story, he noted, is that “folks have woken up” to privacy concerns and their data being and spread without their informed consent. But as he’s waited to talk, the narrative surrounding Kogan has morphed without his input. Facebook, which Kogan said he is currently considering suing for defamation, suggested to the New York Times that he had acted unethically, using an app to collect Facebook user data he claimed was for academic purposes, but later gave to Cambridge Analytica. “This was a scam — and a fraud,” Paul Grewal, Facebook's vice president and deputy general counsel, told the Times last month. Kogan disputed that characterization and noted that his app, which paid users around $4 to take surveys, was separate from his academic work at Cambridge and explicitly told users that the data would be used for commercial purposes. What’s more, the data scientist said his relationship was much deeper with Facebook than previously understood in news reports and the company’s statements. Besides coauthoring a research paper on data that was provided to him by Facebook, Kogan made several visits since 2013 to its Menlo Park, California, campus where he gave talks to employees about behavioral psychology and served as a paid consultant for a week in November 2015. He worked on “at least 10” papers with Facebook’s Pete Fleming, who is now the head of research at Instagram, the company’s photo-sharing platform, while Joseph Chancellor, his cofounder and equal partner at Global Science Research (GSR), the company that harvested the ill-gotten Cambridge Analytica data, has worked at Facebook since late 2015. Kogan also said Chancellor informed Facebook about his work at GSR while interviewing for a position at the company in 2015.\n\nKogan claimed that Facebook shelved plans to publish those papers after a December 2015 Guardian story tied GSR to Cambridge Analytica and the US presidential campaign of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. And while he still considers Chancellor his friend and believes he shouldn’t lose his job, he’s using his cofounder’s situation as evidence for what he said has been a hypocritical reaction by Facebook. The company has cut off Kogan’s personal Facebook and Instagram accounts and pointed fingers at him in full-page newspaper ads, company statements, and in CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony earlier this month. In a statement, Ime Archibong, Facebook’s vice president of product partnerships, acknowledged the company’s previously undisclosed relationship with Kogan between 2013 and 2015, but said that “at no point during these two years was Facebook aware of Kogan’s activities with Cambridge Analytica.” Chancellor did not return a request for comment. When asked why he became involved with SCL Elections in the first place, Kogan said he regretted it but believed the data had no role in shaping voting decisions. While he said he knew that the data was being used for political purposes and would likely be employed by the Republican Party — something he did not say during an uncomfortable appearance on CNN with Anderson Cooper — he assumed that was fair game. “Looking back, the last political campaign to collect Facebook data was the [2012] Obama campaign,” he said. “They were lauded for it.” The Obama campaign did likely have similar data after allowing people to log in to the campaign website with their Facebook credentials, according to a Guardian report. But Obama’s team was using data that users had (perhaps without realizing) granted it permission to access, while GSR transferred the data to third parties. That violated Facebook’s rules, something Kogan said he was unaware of at the time, but now admitted he should not have done. That oversight has proved costly. Kogan, who has an undergraduate degree from the University of California, Berkeley, and a doctorate from the University of Hong Kong, will likely not get another academic job once his position at Cambridge ends this summer, and he’s likely too “toxic” to be hired by any company. Kogan’s San Francisco survey software startup, Philometrics, is also likely dead in the water and is currently unable to raise another round of funding. Kogan has accepted the professional implications, though it’s the personal ones that still bother him. In the coverage of the story, outlets like the Guardian have repeatedly played up the notion that he may somehow be connected to Russia, he said, by pointing out a short research stint at St. Petersburg State University and the fact that he was born in Moldova in the former Soviet Union. “I think they strongly insinuated that I’m a Russian spy based on no evidence whatsoever,” he said, citing the hysteria around the current US investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. “There have been conspiracy theorists that are convinced that I am the missing link between Russia and Trump.” Among those fanning the flames is Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee whose interviews initially exposed his former employer’s work and data collection policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“I think what’s important for people to understand is that this company misappropriated data of upwards of 50 million people from Facebook,” Wylie said on NBC’s Today last month. “That data was processed by psychologists who were going back and forth between London and Russia, who were also working on projects in Russia for Russians.” Kogan called it “Russophobic” and “deeply irresponsible” of Wylie to say that, noting that his psychology work at St. Petersburg had nothing to do with Cambridge Analytica. With regards to his childhood, he said he and his family emigrated when he was 7 to the US from Moscow, where his father was stationed in the Russian army, due to anti-Semitic death threats. Wylie did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Beyond the personal attacks, Kogan said Wylie, who is quoted as having created “Steve Bannon’s psychological warfare tool” has had similar issues standing up claims that he’s made about Cambridge Analytica and its supposed efficacy in swaying voters. Kogan disputed the notion that his former colleague had any knowledge of data, laughing at the notion that he’d be called a data scientist, and referred to him as someone who was involved in business development and provided legal expertise. “Chris is as much a data scientist as I am a fashion icon,” Kogan said. “And I mostly wear sweatpants.” “When he tells people he can do microtargeting with a data set like this, that’s just wrong,” he added. To illustrate his point, Kogan compared the accuracy of the data GSR gave to SCL to a game in which someone guessed a random person’s age: “It’d be like saying on average I’m around about your age by about 14 years. You’re 28? Oh sorry, I thought you were 42.”\n\n\n\nKogan hopes to illustrate that to parliament on Tuesday, the notion that the Cambridge Analytica scandal is one about privacy and not one about a manipulated election. “If there’s one message I want parliament to walk away from, it’s not: Alex didn’t do anything wrong, he’s been scapegoated,” he said. “The main message is: What you’ve been worried about is bullshit, but there is a real issue to think about.” ●\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRyan Mac is a senior technology reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco.

Elle se termine en beauté : la start-up vient de boucler un tour de table de série A, qui lui a permis de récolter 4 millions d'euros auprès d'Odyssée Venture et Kima Ventures (le fonds d'investissement de Xavier Niel) et d'un investisseur privé allemand.\n\n« Avec ces fonds, l'objectif est de nous développer à l'international dans des pays comme l'Allemagne, la Suisse, la Belgique, le Brésil en nous appuyant sur un réseau de commerciaux locaux et d'accélérer encore en Italie et en Espagne », confie Guillaume Liegey. « Nous venons de signer un accord avec le PS du canton de Genève », poursuit l'un des trois fondateurs de la start-up qui mise sur les élections à l'étranger pour nourrir la croissance de la jeune pousse l'an prochain.\n\nAvec Macron pour sa « Grande Marche »\n\nLancée en 2013, celle-ci a s'est fait un nom à l'international trois ans plus tard quand Emmanuel Macron, alors ministre de l'Economie, s'est appuyée sur elle pour orchestrer sa « Grande Marche ». Installée dans le 11e arrondissement de Paris, la jeune pousse a notamment conçu « 50+1 », un logiciel qui permet de croiser cartographie électorale et données socio-démographiques. Le but ? Identifier dans quels lieux les campagnes de porte-à-porte physique des militants des partis politiques doivent se focaliser pour aller convaincre les électeurs indécis. LMP propose aussi des outils optimisant campagnes ciblées de SMS et de mailing.\n\nNon-partisane\n\nEn début d'année, la société avait signé un accord-cadre avec le parti socialiste en vue de la campagne de Benoît Hamon. Le PS avait également négocié un droit d'usage exclusif dans près de 300 circonscriptions (sur 577 en tout) pour ses candidats aux législatives. Revendiqué non-partisane, la start-up tricolore a collaboré avec près de 400 hommes et femmes politiques français(es) lors de la première moitié de l'année. Mais l'activité de LMP demeure encore très saisonnière ; depuis, la demande s'est tarie. Faute d'élections.\n\nRentable\n\n« En France aussi, la priorité est de développer nos capacités commerciales. La demande est très forte quand il y a des échéances électorales, mais maintenant, nous devons parvenir à trouver des clients pour nos logiciels en dehors de ces périodes », souligne Guillaume Liegey. « D'ici à fin 2018, l'objectif est de travailler avec une centaine de députés qui peuvent se servir de nos outils comme d'un CRM (outil de relation client) politique. »\n\nRentable, la start-up parisienne génère aujourd'hui près de 30 % de ses revenus via ses contrats avec des entreprises. RTE, Engie Green, l'Andra : ces groupes travaillent avec LMP pour mener des campagnes de porte à porte concernant des projets industriels qui ne font pas l'unanimité auprès des riverains. Employant une vingtaine de salariés, la jeune pousse va frôler, cette année, les 2 millions d'euros de chiffre d'affaires.",

    "article_text": "After a year in which the internet turned global politics upside down, Emmanuel Macron is trying to use it to strike a new political balance in France.\n\nThe former Minister of the Economy quit the Socialist government in August several months after founding a new political organization, En Marche! (“On the march!” or “Working!”), complete with Yahoo-style exclamation point. Macron believes there is a political center in France that is not being represented by the traditional left-right parties.\n\nTo define that center, and help him build a new political movement from scratch, Macron turned to Liegey Muller Pons, a Paris firm that bills itself as “Europe’s first campaign startup.” The firm was founded by three young Parisians who met in the United States while volunteering for Barack Obama’s campaign in 2008.\n\nImpressed by the way Obama’s team leveraged deep data analysis to attract, organize, and motivate an army of volunteers, the firm is adapting those tactics for a country where politics and rules around privacy and data are very different. Now that Macron is officially running as an independent candidate in the May 2017 French presidential elections, he will need these digital tools to drive a groundswell of grassroots volunteers to have any hope of success.\n\n“We don’t do digital consulting for how to use Facebook or Twitter,” said Guillaume Liegey, a firm cofounder. “We don’t do fundraising. What we really focus on is large-scale coordination of people on the ground. We like to describe what we do as combining data, digital and human.”\n\nThe confounding candidate\n\nTo understand En Marche’s digital strategy, it helps to know a bit about Macron and the place he occupies in French politics.\n\nIn 2012, Socialist François Hollande was elected president of France, defeating incumbent Conservative President Nicolas Sarkozy. Initially, Arnaud Montebourg was appointed Minister of the Economy. Montebourg may be best remembered in Silicon Valley for intervening to block Yahoo’s attempt to buy France’s Dailymotion, but it was just one of several events that left entrepreneurs in France feeling he was less than supportive of startups and innovation.\n\nDuring a cabinet shakeup in 2014, Montebourg was replaced by Macron, then just 37 years old. His youth, along with his meteoric rise, is just one of many reasons he seems to confound the French establishment. He met his wife, 20 years his senior, when she was his high school French teacher. There is a lively debate among intellectuals about what claims Macron can truly make to being a scholar of philosophy, which he studied at university.\n\nBut most puzzling of all was that prior to joining Hollande’s government, Macron was an investment banker, an unusual background for a member of the Socialist Party. In government, he pushed pro-business reforms, angering unions and provoking protest, at one point even prompting a rebellion in the French parliament that almost brought Hollande’s government down. And he has become a vocal supporter of the French Tech initiative that had been launched in 2013 by then-digital minister Fleur Pellerin and expanded under her successor, Axelle Lemaire.\n\n“To be clear about the French momentum, we are accelerating,” he said on stage at the Le Web conference in December 2014. “They key question for us is how to accelerate, and how to help create new businesses. … My job is to be sure that in the coming years we create thousands of new businesses to replace the old ones. … My job is to protect people and allow them to be innovative and take risks.”\n\nMusic to the ears of entrepreneurs, but not all French workers. During a face-to-face confrontation with striking union workers this spring, Macron told one angry striker: “The best way to pay for a suit is to work.” Macron had previously let slip that he was no longer officially a member of the Socialist Party. Earlier this year, with Hollande’s popularity slipping into single digits, Macron announced the creation of En Marche.\n\nA political startup\n\nWell before his break with the Socialist Party, Macron has been talking informally with Liegey. The two had met years earlier when Liegey was working as a consultant for McKinsey. Liegey had left to study at Harvard University in 2007 when he got swept up in the excitement of the Obama campaign and decided to volunteer.\n\nWhile knocking on doors in New Hampshire, Liegey was amazed at the sophistication of data volunteers were given each day in terms of which doors to knock on, which routes to walk, and the profiles of people they were targeting. The experience also convinced him just how powerful face-to-face conversations with voters could be.\n\n“There’s now been a lot of experiments organized that show that the more direct the contact with a voter, the more likely they are to show up at the polls or change their minds,” he said.\n\nLiegey met two other French students in Boston during that time: Arthur Muller and Vincent Pons, who also volunteered for Obama. After moving back to Paris, the trio eventually approached the then-nascent campaign of Hollande in 2012. They suggested they could modernize his campaign efforts by creating more elaborate get-out-the vote efforts enlisting more volunteers, something at the time that wasn’t a standard part of the political playbook for campaigns.\n\nThe trio operated on a volunteer basis for Hollande and the Socialist Party. Eventually, they were given a small budget and grew their team to about 15 volunteers. They developed software in-house that drew heavily on the data from the party’s dues-paying membership list of about 150,000 members at the time. These party activists were connected with volunteers to go door-to-door across the country.\n\n“The technology really helped us scale the size of the campaign,” Liegey said.\n\nThe result: Over the course of the campaign in 2012, they amassed around 40,000 volunteers who knocked on 5 million doors. Hollande narrowly won with 51.7 percent.\n\n“If you look at campaigning in France, they don’t ask anymore if they should do this type of campaigning,” Liegey said. “They just do it.”\n\nThe Great Walk of France\n\nFollowing the Hollande campaign, the three friends officially created Liegey Muller Pons. Liegey stayed in touch with Macron as he joined the French government. Early in 2016, Macron officially hired the firm to help him flesh out his concept for a new political movement.\n\nAt the start, the new team had almost literally no data. Under French privacy laws, people can’t just go down and get copies of voting record databases, or buy third-party databases from market researchers or other politicians as is standard in the U.S. Instead, the group needed people to voluntarily get people to give them their personal information, and to do it on a scale that allow for meaningful insights. That challenge was even greater given that initially, the project was being conducted under the radar.\n\n“There was no database,” Liegey said. “It was prepared in secret. They didn’t want leaks.”\n\nEventually, Macron went public with En Marche, which he said would start with a “Grande Marche.” That is, a process to have conversations with citizens across the country and use their input to create a platform for the new movement. The group launched a website and invited volunteers to register.\n\nWithin a few weeks, the site attracted 30,000 registrations. The En Marche team started using that data to enlist volunteers who would go out into neighborhoods, knock on doors, and conduct interviews. Liegey said they were hoping to get 6,000 volunteers, but only got 5,000. Initially, he was disappointed, but in retrospect he feels good about the conversion rate of volunteers for such a new effort.\n\nThose volunteers were given some basic training in interview techniques and managing other volunteers. Initially, the team tried to develop a voice app for volunteers to record interviews, but it proved to be too difficult to capture good sound in the field, and then it would require transcription. Instead, they developed an app that allowed the team to write keyword answers to a handful of general questions:\n\nWhat works in France?\n\nWhat doesn’t work in France? (Top two answers: education system and politics)\n\nIf you were to say one word about politics in France, what would it be?\n\nTell us about the best/worst experience you had in the past year? (The wave of terrorist attacks over the past two years was by far the largest response for “worst.”)\n\nCan you tell us about a very concrete local initiative around you?\n\nBy now, the team had managed to take the new data it had accumulated on En Marche members and merge it with aggregate and demographic data to create a more sophisticated view of the French electorate. It still didn’t allow the precision available to politicians in the U.S., but they felt they were operating on a more sophisticated level than other French political parties.\n\nFor several weeks in the spring and summer of 2016, En Marche volunteers knocked on doors to gather even more data. But just as important, the idea was to create a culture within En Marche that was more engaged, to have an impact on the volunteers as much as to attract interest from potential voters. They wanted En Marche members to interact with more than just other En Marche volunteers.\n\n“We want to force our members to go out of their inner circle and their neighborhoods and engage with different people,” Liegey said. “We want to use that to understand what is at stake in the country right now. But we also want to send a message that we are here to listen.”\n\nOver a three-month period, En Marche’s 5,000 volunteers knocked on 300,000 doors, spoke to 100,000 people, and filled out 25,000 questionnaires.\n\nWords, words, words\n\nThe next step was to hand all this data over to Paris-based Proxem, a startup that does semantic analysis of text. Proxem used algorithms to sort the responses to not just rank which were the most popular responses, but to determine sentiment and strength of responses (i.e., did the respondent feel strongly or not?).\n\nData analysis in hand, Macron held three town halls across France in October to deliver what he called the “diagnostic.” The meetings lasted two to three hours and were livestreamed. Before Macron spoke, presenters gave fairly detailed explanations of how this process worked that included a 40-page explanatory document and results from Proxem in the form of a 176-page analysis.\n\nAccording to the results, the two biggest themes that emerged were “family” and “social protection.” The most important values: solidarity and integrity. And, conveniently, the analysts detected a strong desire to see a renewal in France’s political life.\n\n“The French appear to be suffering, because they feel they no longer control their own destiny, and that our democratic system is closed to them,” Macron said at one diagnostic. “This is not only a French malaise, but a malaise we find everywhere in Europe because we have a world that is changing brutally.”\n\nFollowing a whirlwind of publicity from the town halls, Macron declared on November 16 that he would be a candidate for president in the May 2017 elections. He announced his candidacy in a livestream on Facebook, but also with a Medium blog post.\n\n“I am convinced that our country has the strength and the desire to move forward because it has the history and the people for it,” he wrote (in French, here). “But France today has left the path of progress.”\n\nThe underdog\n\nWhile political pundits still peg Macron as a long shot, his campaign has captured the imagination of many young people and entrepreneurs in France. Axelle Tessandier may be the perfect example.\n\nTessandier left France in 2009 on a journey that took her to startup worlds in Berlin and then San Francisco, before she returned to Paris in 2016. After helping Kickstarter launch in France, she founded her own firm, the Axl Agency, that helps companies build innovative cultures.\n\nLast year, she was invited to moderate a debate by a group of Macron supporters. That caught the eye of En Marche’s leadership, who then asked her to participate in a more official event over the summer. As she learned more about Macron and En Marche, she found herself thinking it was the beginning of something remarkable.\n\n“Sometimes the criticisms are really targeted toward Macron,” she said. “But they forget how new it is to have a movement that takes three months to go meet thousands of people and talk to them and to listen to them. What other political group has done this kind of open process from the beginning? They created a new movement in a very, very closed system. And suddenly, you have a 39-old innovator running for president.”\n\nThis fall, Tessandier was named one of the 11 official ambassadors of En Marche. She’s not worried about the verdicts of pundits, noting that predictions across the board have been way off this past political year. And she said the inspiration and optimism she and others feel from Macron is real.\n\n“I want us to be the passion vote,” she said. “I want us to be the conviction vote. I want to talk about what kind of society we want to create.”\n\nThat enthusiasm was on display when En March convened in Paris on December 10 for a conference that drew a surprising 15,000 attendees.\n\nSince then, Hollande has since decided not to seek a second term, leaving the Socialist Party to hold a primary this month to seek a new candidate. The conservative Republican party selected the hard-right François Fillon as its candidate, while Marie Le Pen is head of the even further right National Front party.\n\nConventional political wisdom is that the final showdown will be between Fillon and Le Pen. But there have been some more positive polls indicating Macron is gaining ground. And meanwhile, En Marche claims to have 120,000 members registered, who have formed 3,000 local committees and hold on average 400 events each week.\n\nMeanwhile, Macron has been on the move non-stop. The textual analysis from the Grande Marche continues to be mined for keywords Macron uses in his speeches, and to adapt them as he visits different regions and different audiences. And they are providing a wealth of anecdotes about real people and their challenges, Liegey said.\n\nMacron’s and En Marche’s platform continues to evolve. But he has continued to make investment in technology and innovation a key part of his campaign. He has proposed work reforms that make it easier for people to start businesses and work independently. Yet those reform will likely continue to rankle those who worry that he will remove too many classic protections enjoyed by French workers.\n\nIn the next five months, En Marche and Macron will discover whether this political startup can find a center that’s large enough to propel him to victory.\n\n“The digital revolution is doing to destroy some things, and at the same time, it creates opportunity,” Macron said in November during a visit to Toulouse. “It’s important to protect the individual, but also that society accepts risk and the failures. This is a time of revolution for everything, and that includes politics.”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEs1Evc42ZE",

    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron’s party, La Republique En Marche, won a resounding victory Sunday in the final round of the country’s parliamentary elections, gaining a commanding majority in the National Assembly.\n\nThe victory, which dramatically reshapes French politics, is particularly remarkable given that Macron’s party is just a year old and many of its elected representatives are new to government. Macron himself was practically unknown a year ago. But amid a fracturing of support for France’s traditionally powerful parties, En Marche successfully presented itself as a party able to transcend left-right political divides to bring reform.\n\nEn Marche created both a presidential and a parliamentary campaign that mimicked the campaign of then-U.S. Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) in 2008 ― with young candidates pledging change and a large grassroots movement of volunteers getting out the vote. Behind the scenes, the parallel was even more explicit, as Macron employed a political consulting firm called Liegey Muller Pons to bring U.S.-style voter outreach strategy and data collection methods reminiscent of Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns into French politics.\n\nThe consulting firm’s founders, Vincent Pons, Arthur Muller and Guillaume Liegey, met while at Harvard and MIT and had spent time as canvassers for Obama’s data-driven ground game. While volunteering and observing how the Obama campaign ran, they began to note its extensive use of data, door-to-door canvassing and recording of information from voters.\n\nPons, who went door-to-door in New Hampshire in 2012, told HuffPost he was struck by the level of professionalism and technology in Obama’s campaign as compared to French elections. Pons, Liegey and Muller focused their firm on taking some of the methods they’d witnessed in the U.S. and bringing them back to France.\n\nJEFF PACHOUD via Getty Images\n\nFor Macron, Liegey Muller Pons developed an algorithm based on census data and past election results to help En Marche pinpoint neighborhoods in France that were indicative of the country as a whole. Macron’s party then sent tens of thousands of volunteers to speak with potential voters in those areas during 2016, and used these visits as a kind of mass focus group to determine what issues the electorate cared about.\n\n“The effort was not meant to persuade and mobilize voters to support [Macron],” Pons, an assistant professor at Harvard Business School, told HuffPost. “The intention was instead to have a discussion with voters and bridge the gap between politics and voters.”\n\nEn Marche recorded tens of thousands of conversations, using the resulting data to craft Macron’s policy platform and communications strategy. It also planted an early seed in key neighborhoods and helped build a base of volunteers and staff that it could use in its official election campaign this year. Liegey Muller Pons provided analysis on this data to further inform the campaign’s strategy.\n\nPons believes that the process of canvassing and voter engagement outside of the election cycle ― something not previously done in France ― allowed Macron to reach disillusioned citizens who would have otherwise ignored last-minute appeals to vote. It also created an image of a party willing to hear the grievances of voters, even before they were formally asking for a vote in return.\n\nEn Marche and Macron ran on a platform that combined centrist, pro-European Union policies with promises of reform and a change from establishment parties. Unlike the more radical campaigns run by the far-left and far-right candidates, which attracted a high percentage of the youth vote, En Marche received an almost even distribution of voters across age demographics. The party did especially well in major cities and with educated voters.\n\n“The success of En Marche shows that you can also provide a powerful answer by having someone who has reasonable ideas, progressive ideas, but who brings a change simply because he doesn’t have a large political background and is going to present a number of new faces and new candidates,” Pons said.\n\nBertrand Guay / POOL New / Reuters French President Emmanuel Macron attends a ceremony at the Mont Valerien memorial in Suresnes, near Paris, June 18, 2017.\n\nMacron, a banker and former Socialist minister, came from relative obscurity to upend French politics, defeating established party candidates and far-right leader Marine Le Pen to win the presidency last month. But even after his win, Macron still needed a parliamentary majority in order to avoid a gridlocked government and a diminished presidency.\n\nEn Marche fielded more than 14,000 applications from people seeking to run for Parliament. Around half of the party’s 526 candidates are new to politics, and 266 of them are women. La Republique En Marche candidates ended up easily securing a majority on Sunday, as projections showed the party and its centrist ally the MoDems on pace to secure at least 355 seats out of the chamber’s 577.\n\nEven as low voter turnout in parliamentary elections took some sheen off the strong showing, the results still suggest that Macron’s party will have the numbers to enact the wide-ranging reforms promised during the campaign.",

From Berlin, where LMP is opening a new office, he declares, “Maybe I’m biased, but I think what Macron has done has never been done before… he has made politics exciting again because he has shown how somebody who has not been a longterm political insider can build a powerful movement.”",

And not just in the United States.\n\nIn the run-up to this year's French Presidential election — the first round of voting takes place in April — the independent centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron is leveraging technology to close the gap on his better known rivals.\n\nMacron is using the services of Liegey Muller Pons, a Paris firm that bills itself as “Europe's first campaign startup.” The firm was founded by Guillaume Liegey, Arthur Muller and Vincent Pons who met in the United States while volunteering for Barack Obama's campaign in 2008.\n\n“We don't do digital consulting for how to use Facebook or Twitter,” said Guillaume Liegey, a firm cofounder, to Venture Beat. “We don't do fundraising. What we really focus on is large-scale coordination of people on the ground. We like to describe what we do as combining data, digital and human.”\n\nLiegey Muller Pons designs campaign apps based on the latest research in political science and the opportunities offered by open data, big data, and new technologies.\n\nThe apps provide a variety of features for campaign staff, such as analysis and mapping, field actions, and management of contact bases.\n\nThe analysis and maps allows users to visualize electoral results, demographics, and other key characteristics of the designated neighborhoods. The field action function provides the candidate with an opportunity to target priority areas and track in real time volunteer's progress on an interactive map. Lastly, the contact base gives the candidate's team a record of every online and offline interaction with voters and volunteers, as well as, an ability to manage newsletters, emails and SMS from a centralized interface.\n\nOnce considered the future of political campaigning, internet data and analytical research has now become more important than ever, as candidates are struggling to gain a firm grasp of their public standing.\n\nThis is mainly due to Europe's regulation on gathering personal data. Macron hired the firm to help him get people to voluntarily disclose their personal information, and to do it on a scale that would allow for meaningful insights.\n\nThe result was En Marche, a website that allowed supporters to volunteer to interview citizens for the campaign's records. Over a three-month period, En Marche's 5,000 volunteers knocked on 300,000 doors, spoke to 100,000 people, and filled out 25,000 questionnaires.\n\nAs of Jan. 5, conservative candidate Francois Fillon's lead in France's presidential election race has narrowed, according to an opinion poll showing Macron gaining on both the former prime minister and far-right leader Marine Le Pen.\n\nMacron polled at between 16 and 24%, up on last month's poll, with his performance varying depending on who will be chosen as Socialist candidate in the party's upcoming primaries.\n\nA strong showing by Macron come May can only raise the profile of data and analytics when it comes to connecting with the electorate.",

    "article_text": "On 7 April 2016, Emmanuel Macron took to the stage in front of a few hundred people in his hometown of Amiens and proposed something that even he admitted “might seem a bit crazy here tonight”. He was starting a national political movement. The economy minister of 20 months, who had never stood before in an election, sensed an opportunity. “I don’t know if it’s going to work,” admitted the then-38-year-old.\n\nEmmanuel Macron’s appeal has already worn thin | Gabriel Bristow Read more\n\nJust over a year later, he had become president, and his party, En Marche, swept the national assembly in one of the biggest peacetime transformations of French politics.\n\nMacron and his team were inspired by Barack Obama’s trailblazing jump from little-known senator to US president. But Obama did it the traditional way, coming up through the existing party system. When a longstanding mentor suggested to Macron that he should build himself a political fiefdom first, perhaps by running a large city, he was dismissive. “You’re talking about yesterday’s world. It doesn’t work like that now,” he replied.\n\nThe admirer of Californian start-up culture had spotted what was obvious from democracies across the world: we are in an age of political innovation, when newcomers are able to upend the status quo in record time. Having transformed communications, friendships, sex and business, the effects of the internet and social media are now being fully felt in the political world.\n\nAcross Europe and beyond, from the Czech Republic’s ANO to Spain’s Podemos to US president Donald Trump, new political offerings have emerged as technological changes have made it easier than ever to raise money and disseminate a programme – the traditional role of parties.\n\nFrance, the country of revolution, is once again a leading political laboratory. Macron is the most vivid example yet of a modern-day political disruptor. Not only did he create a victorious party from scratch in record time, he also won with a progressive centrist manifesto at a time of surging rightwing nationalism.\n\nAs such, he provides lessons for those seeking to follow in his footsteps – and there are many. The firm that designed his grassroots campaign, Liegey Muller Pons, has been inundated with requests for help.\n\nSo what do you need to succeed – in addition to good fortune? And could Britain, where pro-European sympathisers are hoping for a saviour, produce its own Macron?\n\nFirst, you need an angry electorate and the political space created when existing parties fail to address the concerns of a large section of the population. The US and France were ripe for political upheaval in 2016 and 2017; wealthy, stable Germany less so.\n\nSecond, any movement needs a dynamic figurehead. Macron is no political showman, but his powers of seduction – a mixture of good looks, maturity and “an almost juvenile, joyous side” one ex-colleague told me – are admired even by many of his opponents. Future disruptors are increasingly likely to come from the worlds of showbiz, business or even sport.\n\nBut charisma alone is not enough. Brands and politicians today yearn for something more powerful: authenticity. Today’s consumers want the “real”, not the phoney, and demand transparency. Macron has willingly exposed his personal life, allowing his wedding video to be broadcast and inviting fly-on-the-wall documentary teams to follow him around. He also used his own story of “transgression” – his marriage to his former school teacher, 24 years his senior – to back up his image as a political maverick.\n\nThis desire for authenticity favours untarnished youth – see Austria’s new 31- year-old chancellor-in-waiting – or people perceived as coming from outside the grubby world of politics.\n\nMany of the new political entrepreneurs will also be brash. In a noisy and hyperbolic world, you need to cut through the din. As Macron likes to say: “If you’re shy, you’re dead.” This explains his sometimes brutal language, or his promises to “transform” France and “refound” the European Union. But this tactic comes with a caveat: over-blown rhetoric will lead to disappointment if expectations aren’t met.\n\nBeing charismatic, confident and distinctive are good starting points. Next comes the organisational work.\n\nThe internet offers formidable scope for raising money. But scaling up a movement requires major resources. This favours anyone able to tap personal wealth, or in Macron’s case, a network of bankers and business people who turbocharged En Marche in its first crucial months.\n\nDeveloping a coherent vision is also key. Single-issue or unfocused movements are eventually sapped by their divisions. Macron made all members of En Marche sign a charter setting out four broad commitments that shaped the party: pro-Europe, pro-private enterprise, progressive and attached to the notion of “kindness”.\n\nHis team was also aware that the internet, for all its ability to network people, can often feel like a lonely place. En Marche’s strength was offering openness online – no fees, easy registration – followed by mass door-knocking exercises and local brainstorming sessions.\n\nLastly, every leader needs a team of believers. When he launched En Marche, Macron had secretly assembled a core of around 10 aides in their 20s and 30s who helped run operations with what cynics saw as almost sect-like devotion.\n\nEach country will have its specificities, but this new age of political innovation will undoubtedly produce more Macrons – and more Trumps. It will also allow their opponents to organise resistance more easily.\n\nNew parties will be ephemeral, composing and decomposing over time. And they will have difficulties providing followers with the tribal sense of belonging offered by an established political machine. For all its electoral success, En Marche’s roots remain shallow.\n\nSo could Brexit Britain produce a Macron figure?\n\nMacron will never be Europe’s saviour if he keeps playing to the populists Read more\n\nThere are many reasons to doubt it in the short-term. Parliamentary rather than presidential systems are a trickier proposition. Given the power of the rightwing media, a British Macron could not expect the often favourable coverage accorded the French original. And Jeremy Corbyn’s positioning on the left as an “outsider” has already attracted many of the disillusioned voters a new entrant would need.\n\nCentrist well-wishers on the continent live in hope, but have been left puzzled. Like watching the Eurovision song contest and wondering why musical powerhouse Britain puts forward such dismal acts, they question why a country whose past includes such illustrious leaders looks so bereft of political talent. But the same might have been said of France until Macron made his “crazy” speech on a stage in Amiens.\n\n• Adam Plowright is author of The French Exception: Emmanuel Macron – the Extraordinary Rise and Risk",

    "article_text": "—The improbable rise of Emmanuel Macron as the youngest president in modern French history – held up as a rebuke to transatlantic populism and generating expectations from Boston to Berlin – started with the big hope of women like Christelle Dernon.\n\nMs. Dernon was one of thousands of French people who signed up for the political movement “En Marche” that Mr. Macron started just a year ago, knocking on doors across the country and helping create and curate the message of optimism that ultimately prevailed at the polls Sunday night.\n\nAt the time the then-economy minister was not a presidential candidate. In fact, his name was barely known, and certainly not outside of France. But Dernon was impressed by her perception that he put projects above politics, and when he started his movement outside the traditional party apparatus – claiming to be neither left nor right – the 25-year-old who didn’t even vote in the previous presidential election joined his army of volunteers.\n\n“He was talking to people, engaging in dialogue, something that we don’t see that often in France,” she says on a recent evening outside his headquarters where she has put in almost as many hours as into her day job as a public affairs consultant. “I subscribed right away. I wanted to be part of it.”\n\n“When we started we just thought that we were building a project, a platform but probably for 2022,” she adds. “So it went way faster than we imagined.”\n\nIndeed, Macron’s victory Sunday night not only surprised his own movement, it caps one of the most extraordinary races in French history. Both mainstream parties were ousted from the race, and the runoff featured two outsider candidates with wildly divergent ideas for France’s future. Marine Le Pen made it to round two with an anti-immigrant, anti-EU message that tapped into pessimism in French society, while Macron forged forward, unapologetically pro-global and pro-European. The French opted for the latter, with 66 percent choosing Macron, compared to 34 percent for Ms. Le Pen, a larger margin than polls predicted.\n\nAnd now he faces the enormous task of channeling the expectations – and some would say idealism – of Dernon and the movement he founded into a reformist, centrist presidency that pushes back against the populist forces that still lurk.\n\n'Oui, nous pouvons'?\n\nIf all of this sounds familiar – perhaps too familiar, from some vantages – to the American election of Barack Obama, it’s not a coincidence.\n\nThe first major action of “En Marche” was the door-to-door campaign of which Dernon became part, marching across France in a listening tour. Called the “Grande Marche,” it was unabashedly American in style, and, organized by the electoral technology startup Liegey Muller Pons, it borrowed directly from Mr. Obama’s 2008 presidential bid.\n\nWhat they found, in conversations across the country that focused on what’s working at the local level and what could be expanded, is that polls didn’t always reflect the full scope of people’s views. “There is a tendency among French people to be pessimistic about their future,” says Vincent Pons, a co-founder of Liegey Muller Pons. “But during these interactions Emmanuel Macron found out that there were many people who had ideas, who had a positive outlook of the country.”\n\nIt’s one reason Macron so enthusiastically embraced optimism as a guiding message, despite the general sense that it is pessimism that is winning the era.\n\nBut now he faces the gargantuan task of unifying the nation. Despite Macron's decisive victory, Le Pen still won a third of the electorate – a historic win for her National Front – while another third either abstained or cast blank votes, refusing to endorse either candidate. While “En Marche” calls itself a movement of optimism, of the two-thirds of voters who cast ballots for Macron, many did so begrudgingly – because they feared Le Pen’s rise. Despite his outsider claims, many see him as a continuation of President François Hollande, the most unpopular president of the Fifth Republic. He faces the immediate challenge of legislative elections – where a man without a party seeks to secure a majority next month.\n\n“He is a candidate who did not play on people’s fears, on people’s resentments, anger. He did not try to look for scapegoats, Islam, immigration, or European institutions,” says Karim Bitar, a senior research fellow at the Institute for International and Strategic Relations in Paris. “But many of the 66 percent of voters who chose him did not necessary adhere to this message of hope that he was carrying. They were basically trying to say no to Marine Le Pen. It is going to be quite difficult to maintain the climate of hope.”\n\nDialogue, not condemnation\n\nAs thousands of supporters cheered and danced in the courtyard of the Louvre Palace, in front of I.M. Pei’s glass pyramid Sunday night, Macron seemed to acknowledge the doubts after his victory was announced. “I know the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that very many of you have also expressed. It's my responsibility to hear them,” he said.\n\nThat’s the kind of message that first piqued Dernon’s interest. After the Bataclan terrorist attack in November 2015 that rocked Paris, she says he was the only one who wasn’t fixating on a foreign threat. “He said, ‘This is the second time we are attacked by French people on French people. We need to think about the roots of this to solve the problem.’ I appreciated he had the courage to say this at that time, no one was saying that,” she says.\n\nLater, when his government tried to push forward deeply unpopular labor reform, she was drawn to his style that seemed not to bash people or parties but to debate projects.\n\n'When you hear the Socialists, or the rightwing party, they are just always about bashing the other,' says Christelle Dernon, a volunteer for Emmanuel Macron's 'En Marche' movement. 'They never suggest anything to improve things.' Sara Miller Llana/The Christian Science Monitor | Caption\n\nShe still thinks economic reform will be his biggest bugaboo. Many already dismiss him as a candidate of corporatism and could resist his reform agenda. But Dernon says that his gift for dialogue will make the difference. “When you do political reform in France no one explains it. It’s just, ‘We are going to do this.’ Then everyone goes on strike. Then nothing happens. It has been the same thing since I was born,” she says.\n\n“People don’t understand that the social rights come from a different time. There are jobs that are disappearing and we have to adapt our system,” she says. “This is not saying we are going to do everything like the US, it’s not working in the US either. We have to build our own system protecting people but also bringing more mobility and possibility for people to move into jobs.”\n\nMr. Pons, also an associate professor at Harvard Business School, says the timing might be right for him to effect change. The same breakdown in ideological divides that ushered him into power could also boost his leadership, since so much resistance to reform came from the rejection of the political class in the first place.\n\n“The strength of Macron is that he is a new face. He is really young, relatively charismatic, his movement is entirely new,\" Pons says. \"So he benefits from a lot of credit. He benefits from much more trust by French voters than moderate parties do. This trust maybe could be very instrumental in helping him implement reforms.”\n\nWaiting for change\n\nFor a man whose party is just over one year old, these are outsize expectations – another parallel, this one ominous, with Obama, who won the Nobel Peace prize early in his term with the world looking on, setting expectations that left many deeply disappointed.\n\nBut not Dernon. She says her political activism was directly inspired by the former American president, and when she heard his \"yes we can\" spirit in Macron's movement – including Obama volunteers working directly in their campaign – she joined without hesitating. On a trip to Washington in January, she says she bumped into Obama’s daughter Malia in a park – something she considers more than a coincidence.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n\nCognizant of what followed Obama's two terms in office – the arrival of Mr. Trump – she has hope that Macron is the man to effect change without populism winning in the future. She says she’s not an idealist, something she couldn’t be after knocking on thousands of doors. “Sometimes you have a conversation with someone who doesn’t understand anything, or who is just aggressive,” she says. “In the end you are just like, ‘What is the point of doing all this?’ It can feel quite frustrating and disappointing.”\n\nAnd yet amid hundreds of slammed doors were hundreds more that opened. Her lasting impression: “People are waiting for this kind of change.\"",

    "article_text": "This article is part of our special report Big data meets politics.\n\nUS politicians are the acknowledged forerunners when it comes to using digital technologies in election campaigns. But Europeans are making strides in their attempt to catch up, with the 2014 EU election providing a testing ground for big data analysts.\n\nThe Howard Dean campaign for the 2004 US presidential election is considered as a kind of year zero of data analytics applied to political campaigning. Although he lost the Democratic party nomination to John Kerry, Dean is remembered for pioneering internet-based fundraising and grassroots mobilisation, which inspired others after him.\n\nEchoes of the Dean campaign are still being heard today, but with an added twist called big data analytics. Political campaigners have long sought to segment their electorate according to income, ethnic origin, age group or any other socio-demographic factor that can play a role in an election.\n\nThis ability to identify and target specific parts of the population was taken to a new level during the 2012 US election. And it was made possible by big data analytics.\n\n“The Obama 2012 campaign used data analytics and the experimental method to assemble a winning coalition vote by vote,” writes Sasha Issenberg, author of The Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns.\n\n“In doing so, it overturned the long dominance of TV advertising in US politics and created something new in the world: a national campaign run like a local ward election, where the interests of individual voters were known and addressed,” Issenberg wrote in the MIT Technology Review.\n\nLessons from US elections are usually quick to cross the Atlantic. In Brussels, the digital methods of the Obama campaign provided inspiration for the Party of European Socialists (PES) during the last EU Parliament elections in 2014.\n\nBrian Synnott was press and web communications coordinator for Martin Schulz, the PES frontrunner in 2014. He says big data analytics offered a whole new way of identifying and mobilising voters.\n\n“Unlike a national election where you’re fighting for floating voters, you’re looking at people who would naturally agree with your line but need to be mobilised to just go out and vote,” Synnott recalls.\n\n‘Knock the vote’ campaign\n\nThe Schulz team had done their math before the campaign, based on turnout figures, to measure the size of their electorate. Whereas national elections register between 65 and 80% turnout, European elections tend to score 43 to 50% at best, Synnott said. “So that opened up a much higher percentage of the electorate that would be your core base,” he told euractiv.com.\n\nBased on these calculations, the PES launched what they called the ‘knock the vote’ campaign. “‘Knock the vote’ was about how you digitally go knocking on people’s doors – not just to encourage them to go and vote but also to campaign and mobilise,” Synnott said.\n\n“A lot of the practical steps involved Facebook,” he said, explaining that “Facebook is excellent if calibrated towards grassroots mobilisation”. Twitter, on the other hand, is better suited for sending out information to targeted audiences.\n\n“Put simply, you could say: Facebook for mobilisation, Twitter for information,” Synnott said.\n\nVoter records\n\nBut how do you identify those potential voters?\n\nOne big difference between Europe and the US is access to voting records. In the US, campaigners can consult registers of previous elections, allowing them to identify neighbourhoods – individual houses, and people – who are likely to back their candidate.\n\nThese records contain information such as age, gender, and income, but also participation in previous elections, including voting preferences. For some individuals, these records can be extremely detailed. Digging through this data allows predicting the probability that individuals will vote for a candidate and target undecided voters in the hope of turning around an election.\n\n“This is really big data: a table with one million people, and each of them with 7,000 entries,” says a Brussels insider with knowledge of digital campaigning tools and methods.\n\nMatching these voter records with profiles developed by data brokers allows campaigners to grow a database of potential voters who can then be approached in several ways: via social media, on the phone, or in person, knocking on their doors.\n\n“If you have information about how old they are, how much they earn and where they live, then you look for people who are similar and approach them,” the Brussels insider explains.\n\nData misuse\n\nIn Europe, most countries don’t allow access to voter records, so campaigners look for their data elsewhere.\n\nIt can be obtained from electoral polls, but also from “surveys, interviews, door to door, focus groups, applications in social networks, web statistics, data obtained by local campaign staff, etc.” says Xavier Peytibi, a political consultant who has run various campaigns for presidential, regional, and local elections in Spain and Latin America.\n\nHowever, this can prove legally borderline, for example when individuals are identified by website “cookies” tracking their online activity, sometimes without them realising.\n\n“Data can be misused in many different ways,” warns Aurélie Valtat, an official in charge of digital strategy at the European Commission’s development directorate (DG Devco), which manages multi-million international assistance programmes in the world’s poorest countries.\n\n“It can be misused because it hasn’t been captured in an honest and legal way,” she told a EURACTIV event on big data mining, held in March. “It can also be misused because the people supplying the data are not representative of the population that you’re trying to capture,” she said. Another challenge, Valtat pointed out, is whether the private records of individuals can be stored legally or not, and for how long.\n\nDiego Naranjo, a privacy campaigner for the European Digital Rights initiative (EDRi), is more alarmist. “Data brokers have our personal data and they are already trafficking with it,” he told the EURACTIV event, pointing to what he calls “pregnant data” stored on databases and ready to be sold without consideration for privacy or fundamental rights.\n\nFor political campaigners desperately looking to expand their electorate, the temptation to buy dubious databases can be difficult to resist.\n\nBut surprisingly, a lot of the personal information is also provided voluntarily by grassroots campaigners or party sympathisers on social media.\n\n“We got data from Facebook but also from a tool called NationBuilder, which allows people to sign up for the campaign,” Synnott told EURACTIV. “And you have the possibility of building an electoral picture based on that.”\n\nThe trick is to use those verified – and legally obtained – personal records as a basis for growing a database of people with similar socio-demographic attributes. “By building a grassroots campaign through a tool like NationBuilder, you’d be able to build up your profiles that way and then apply them on different platforms,” Synnott explains.\n\nFrom data to persuasion\n\nFor some, data has turned into an obsession, if not an addiction.\n\n“Big data, today, is an essential tool for an election campaign,” says Xavier Peytibi. “In any city, in any election, it is essential to meet your voters, and it is also essential in order to get your message across to impact them in a more direct way,” he told EURACTIV.\n\n“Data is information and information is power to discern what message by a party or candidate can get closer to a supporter or a voter, either to mobilise him or to get him to vote,” he said.\n\nThe hunger for data by political campaigns has fostered a growing industry of analytics start-ups and political consultancies. One of them is Liegey Muller Pons, a Paris-based firm, which claims to be the first campaign technology start-up in Europe.\n\nAs you would expect, the firm draws much of its inspiration from field trips it made to the US. “The most recent political campaigns [in the US] were targeting mainly two groups: the democrat ‘abstentionist’ and the hesitant ‘participationist’,” Liegey Muller Pons wrote in a blog post reflecting on the 2012 Presidential election.\n\n“Today, the latest innovations are aimed at improving persuasion models to identify even more precisely what fractions of the electorate can change their minds after a campaign contact and what messages and arguments are able to produce that change,” the firm wrote.\n\nLiegey Muller Pons is close to the Socialist family and advised the PES during the 2014 EU election campaign. It currently counts French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron among its most prestigious clients.\n\nBut the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) is equally keen on digital tools.\n\nJuncker campaign goes digital\n\nDuring the 2014 election, the campaign team of EPP candidate Jean-Claude Juncker – now President of the European Commission—made heavy use of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Flickr to spread its message.\n\n“The Juncker campaign had a team of 25 e-campaigners who sat in the ‘war room’ of the EPP headquarters and oversaw the campaign’s numerous Facebook pages and Twitter,” recalls Juncker’s spokesperson Natasha Bertaud, who was among the key figures in the Juncker team.\n\n“Contrary to the other campaigns, the EPP had Twitter accounts and Facebook pages for every EU member state we were campaigning in,” allowing targeting local audiences in their native language, Bertaud told EURACTIV.\n\nThe multilingual dimension of the Juncker campaign allowed “generating the most ‘buzz’ around the EPP candidate,” Bertaud claims. Within weeks, Juncker’s Twitter account had already gained 20,000 followers, she said.\n\nLimits of big data\n\nBut Bertaud is also quick to remind the limits of digital campaigning, especially in a European election context, where interest is lower than for national elections.\n\n“You have to be realistic about what you can expect in terms of reach – this was not a US presidential election and Juncker was never going to rival Justin Bieber for followers,” she said.\n\nSocial media buzz is indeed no accurate proxy to predict who will win an election, according to Wired, America’s longest-running tech culture magazine. Still, online activity “does give us a previously unseen window into the types of issues Americans care about most,” the magazine writes.\n\n“It’s trends,” Valtat summarised. “Big data mining can give you information about trends in elections, trends in public opinion and what it means for the people involved. But it’s not a reflection of the real world – it’s just an image through social media”.\n\nSynnott agrees, and cautions about focussing election campaigns too heavily on digital and big data.\n\n“‘Digital’ is not something that exists in isolation,” he said. “It’s a tool that’s part of an overall strategy. So you have to combine it with grassroots, with face-to-face, in a way that people can relate to it”.\n\nHe is also keen to assuage concerns by conspiracy theorists who see big data as a dangerous tool for government surveillance or electoral brainwashing.\n\n“Some people get scared and see this just as big data. But it’s also genuine engagement with real people who can get a sense of their own stakes in a political campaign,” Synnott said.\n\n“Most importantly, I think there was a template established that I think could be used in 2019.”",

    "article_text": "Temps de lecture: 3 min\n\nOn ne sait pas si la campagne de 2017 verra naître un candidat des start-uppeurs, bien que les candidats s’efforcent de les séduire. En revanche, on peut parier qu’un des prétendants raflera le titre, plus ou moins officiel, de candidat des consultants. Et Emmanuel Macron s’est confortablement installé sur cette niche électorale. Faute d’appartenir à une tradition politique claire (le peut-être-candidat insiste sur l’abandon du clivage gauche/droite, ce qui est toujours suspect, surtout à gauche), le macronisme est une méthode, dont les emprunts sont plus à chercher du côté des grands cabinets de conseil en organisation que de la science politique.\n\nEn posant comme première pierre de sa démarche un «diagnostic» de l’état de la France, préalable à un «plan de transformation» de la société, Emmanuel Macron emprunte la terminologie des missions de conseil, dans lesquelles une phase d’audit précède celle des préconisations et enfin la mise en œuvre des orientations proposées.\n\nL’image du diagnostic renvoie a priori à l’univers médical (selon un participant au meeting de Macron s’exprimant à la tribune, «un bon médecin commence par nous écouter, et procède à un diagnostic et à des analyses avant de prescrire un traitement.») Mais elle s’applique aussi à la mission-type dans laquelle le consultant-candidat prend le pouls de la société avant de lui administrer son plan de changement. Les 25.000 questionnaires recueillis par l’équipe de son mouvement En marche ! lors de la phase de rencontre avec les Français ont nourri cet audit, dont l’homme politique-consultant a tiré la synthèse présentée lors d’un meeting à Strasbourg mardi 4 octobre, après avoir laissé la parole à des sympathisants faisant en quelque sorte office de cas-client types. Un meeting qui avait, comme lors du lancement de son mouvement, des airs de conférences TED, événements dont les consultants raffolent.\n\nSchéma de mission de conseil stratégique intitulé «méthodologie de conduite de projet» | RHB Consultants\n\nLe porte-parole des insatisfactions\n\nDans Libération, l’ancien ministre explique le 3 octobre qu’il veut, avec sa «marche» auprès des Français, «mieux cerner les problèmes concrets des gens, les sujets sur lesquels ils souhaitent vraiment des réponses», pour ne pas faire «un programme politique dont on ne sait pas s’il correspond aux vraies problématiques des gens». Lors de son meeting étaient diffusés les avis des Français interviewés par En Marche!. Macron tire ainsi une légitimité de la volonté de changement qui s’exprime, se positionnant comme le porte-parole des insatisfactions plutôt que comme un leader politique qui entend convaincre un électorat. Comme consultant, Emmanuel Macron affecte un devoir de réserve sur l’état de la France. Il se contente d’enregistrer les doléances du client et de les reformuler pour ensuite proposer le plan d’action qui s’impose. La suite de la mission sera pour le prochain meeting. Deux sont déjà prévus: le 11 et le 18 octobre au Mans et à Montpellier autour de thèmes plus précis.\n\nCette participation du public qui rappelle les remontées du terrain organisées par les clubs Désir d’Avenir de la candidate Ségolène Royal en 2007 se double de l’apport de véritables entreprises de conseil. Le même article de Libération cité plus haut indique que Macron a travaillé avec Liegey Muller Pons, un trio de spécialistes de l’optimisation du ciblage des campagnes de porte à porte par l’analyse des données électorales, ou encore Proxem qui a réalisé une analyse sémantique à partir des réponses recueillies (et qui a par ailleurs réalisé mon audit éditorial à partir des articles que j'ai écrits pour Slate).\n\nChaque candidat construisant sa campagne à la marge du monde politique ou de son clivage élémentaire doit compenser ce flou par une créativité formelle. Cela se retrouvait avec le participatif matiné de web 2.0 de Ségolène Royal ou avec les «faizeux» de l'écrivain Alexandre Jardin (et de son mouvement Bleu Blan Zèbre lancé en 2014), citoyens de la société civile qui retroussent leurs manches. Mais c'est peut-être la première fois que l'imaginaire des cabinets de conseil investit à ce point la pré-campagne.\n\nL'ex-ministre Macron n'est pourtant pas le seul à organiser sa campagne en mode projet: on pense ainsi à Arnaud Montebourg et à son «projet France», un «projet [...] alternatif aux appareils politiques et audacieux pour inventer notre futur». Là aussi on promet des «solutions nouvelles et concrètes» loin des appareils partisans. Comme si, à défaut d'une orientation à donner à une politique, on se contenterait du registre de l'action et de son évaluation.",

    "article_text": "Luc Guillemot\n\nManouk Borzakian\n\nDes chatons aux affiches de campagne, les images nous envahissent, ce alors même que les cultures occidentales, depuis Platon dans La République, oscillent entre fascination et méfiance pour des objets soupçonnés d’offrir une vision trompeuse de la réalité. Entre autres occasions, chaque scrutin électoral sert de prétexte aux cartes pour fleurir dans la presse, comme si les journalistes politiques cédaient soudain à la « mystique de la carte » chère à Mark Monmonnier[1], et comptaient sur leurs lecteurs pour leur emboîter le pas, c’est-à-dire faire confiance à l’information véhiculée par quelques taches de couleur sur une France en modèle réduit, sans interroger l’infinité de manières dont on peut cartographier un même jeu de données (choix du fond de carte, du découpage statistique, des couleurs et motifs, etc.).\n\nDès lors, pour accompagner l’obsession pour le Front National dont ont fait preuve les grands médias durant la campagne des Régionales, les cartes de résultats n’ont pas manqué de venir appuyer visuellement des titres colonisés par les champs lexicaux de la catastrophe naturelle et de l’épidémie : raz-de-marée, vague (bleu marine), France « rongée par le cancer »… Mais que disent vraiment ces cartes ? Et comment sont-elles fabriquées ?\n\nLe fond de carte : point aveugle de la carte électorale\n\nCommençons par un court rappel : le contrat opéré par la mise en carte d’un espace consiste à faire correspondre, sur un espace de représentation (la carte), la répartition d’un phénomène social (puits de pétrole, joueurs de football, conquêtes militaires…). Pour guider des promeneurs, par exemple, une carte de randonnée utilise un fond de carte topographique indiquant sentiers et autres courbes de niveau. Quant aux cartes électorales, elles représentent certes l’espace d’une élection (région, département, commune…), mais il ne faut pas perdre de vue que c’est des électeurs que l’analyse doit rendre compte pour saisir le phénomène hautement social qu’est une élection. Dans un but didactique louable (accéder facilement aux résultats de sa commune en cliquant dessus), les cartes publiées dans la presse au lendemain des deux tours des Régionales tendent à occulter une dimension fondamentale de l’espace électoral : les électeurs eux-mêmes.\n\nLa raison : sur une carte choroplèthe classique, chaque commune se voit attribuer une couleur et/ou une valeur d’intensité indiquant la liste arrivée en tête ou le pourcentage réalisé par un parti. Exemple parmi tant d’autres, la carte prospective réalisée par le CEVIPOF et Liegey Muller Pons offre l’image saisissante d’une France uniforme du point de vue démographique : peu importe la population d’une commune, sa superficie détermine son importance sur la carte. Pourtant, une telle représentation comporte des défauts évidents et cela fait quelques années que plusieurs géographes attirent l’attention sur les dangers non pas tellement des cartes électorales elles-mêmes, mais de leur usage mécanique, sans recul, comme si elles allaient de soi.\n\nEn l’occurrence, cette représentation « classique » du scrutin régional utilise un fond de carte à la fois régional et communal (les deux échelles du phénomène observé) et utilise comme métrique l’espace euclidien (celui de nos cours de géométrie du collège, en deux dimensions et où la distance se mesure en mètres). Résultat, le territoire français est traité de façon uniforme et les communes quasiment vides (près de 27000 des 36000 communes françaises comptent moins de 1000 habitants) se voient dotées d’un poids visuel disproportionné, alors que champs, prairies, forêts et autres réseaux autoroutiers prennent de la place mais ne votent pas. Ainsi, Meyrueis, charmante bourgade de la Lozère comptant 814 habitants et 651 électeurs, possède visuellement le même statut que Paris, l’une et l’autre occupant une superficie d’un peu plus de 100 km2.\n\nDeux remèdes graphiques\n\nPremier remède possible, dont la popularité progresse lentement mais sûrement, les cartogrammes (autre nom des cartes par anamorphose) font correspondre les surfaces sur la carte au poids démographique de chaque commune : la prédominance visuelle d’une couleur est alors bien celle du parti qui domine dans la population. On découvre alors un espace de l’abstention majoritairement urbain, les centres-villes et la proche banlieue – en particulier les banlieues populaires – des principales métropoles (Paris, Lyon) dépassant largement le niveau national. De même, moins caricatural que la vision d’un cancer qui rongerait la France, le cartogramme présentant la liste arrivée en tête au 1er tour dans chaque commune offre une image plus nuancée de la place qu’occupe le Front national dans le paysage électoral français, avec 27,7% des suffrages exprimés.\n\nUne autre méthode permet de donner aux unités spatiales une place proportionnelle à leur poids démographique, mais sans maltraiter le fond de carte auquel nos yeux ont été habitués par les manuels scolaires. Les cartes value-by-alpha, popularisées par Andy Woodruff pour l’élection présidentielle américaine de 2008, font varier non plus le fond de carte, mais la luminosité de chaque entité en fonction de sa population. Ainsi, sur la carte en exergue de ce billet, les communes les plus peuplées ressortent grâce à leur opacité, tandis que les moins peuplées disparaissent quasiment dans le fond noir. Que l’on retienne les listes de tête ou les seuls scores du FN, on obtient une alternative cartographique au tapis ’bleu marine’ qui s’étalerait de Calais à Mulhouse et de Perpignan à Nice.\n\nÉlecteurs des villes et électeurs des champs\n\nOr, qui dit autre représentation dit autre interprétation. Les deux cartes n’invalident certes pas une lecture régionale : en particulier, le pourtour méditerranéen, on le sait, reste une terre frontiste, où le parti de Marine Le Pen a enregistré parmi ses meilleurs scores du 1er tour – par exemple : 50,4% à Fréjus ou 57,6% à Marignane, mais aussi 41,1% dans l’ancien bastion communiste de Martigues. Émerge cependant aussi une géographie du vote frontiste structurée par l’opposition ville-campagne ou, si l’on préfère, par les « gradients d’urbanité »[2]. En effet, les régions qui ont le plus voté pour le Front national ne l’ont pas fait de manière homogène : tandis que le FN est arrivé en tête dans la majorité des communes du nord de la France, le rose (ou le blanc lumineux) de Lille et Villeneuve-d’Ascq tranche avec la couronne orangée de l’ancien bassin minier ; de même, Nice, Aix-en-Provence ou Montpellier constituent les derniers points de butée du FN autour de la Méditerranée. L’évolution du score du FN entre le 1er et le 2nd tour renforce ce constat : les agglomérations de Paris et Lyon ont affirmé un rejet massif pendant que, dans les régions les plus favorables, les villes-centres[3] (Narbonne, Béthune, Lens, Douai, Amiens) ont davantage résisté à l’augmentation du vote FN au second tour – à l’exception notable de Marseille.\n\nLes cartes, si elles ne suffisent pas à fonder une analyse électorale exhaustive, permettent donc ici de constater que deux géographies de l’attitude anti-establishment se complètent : le vote Front National dans les régions les moins urbanisées, l’abstention dans les villes.\n\nLa mesure de l’espace\n\nTerminons par l’évocation d’un moment crucial du processus de fabrication de la carte, qui ne concerne pas seulement les cartographes : le choix des données. Débat vieux comme l’analyse électorale, mais toujours plus sensible au fil des scrutins français, faut-il retenir les pourcentages « officiels », rapportés aux suffrages exprimés, ou convient-il au contraire de considérer l’abstention comme un acte politique à part entière, et recalculer les scores par rapport au nombre d’inscrits sur les listes électorales ? La seconde option permet non seulement de relativiser la représentativité des élus, mais aussi, le cas échéant, de reconsidérer l’audience de certains partis, tant dans l’espace géographique que parmi les classes socioprofessionnelles.\n\nEn se fondant sur les sondages à la sortie des urnes, on vérifie ainsi qu’au 1er tour des Régionales, parmi des ouvriers s’abstenant à 61%, le FN atteint le score pas vraiment stratosphérique, une fois rapporté aux inscrits, de 16,8%. C’est moins que les 17,2% de la catégorie « Agriculteurs et chefs d’entreprises » (dont on peut certes discuter l’homogénéité), à peine plus que les 15% des employés.\n\nPas question, en somme, de disqualifier les cartes électorales, encore moins l’indispensable complément qu’elles apportent à la compréhension des comportements électoraux, par la mise en lumière de spécificités géographiques que la sociologie et la science politique ignorent trop souvent.\n\nEn revanche, il faut sans relâche attirer l’attention des lecteurs de cartes sur ce qui se joue en coulisses lors du (long) processus de fabrication d’une carte, avec à chaque étape plusieurs options, susceptibles de mener à des résultats suffisamment différents pour donner lieu à des interprétations diverses, sinon contradictoires.\n\n[1] Auteur du très recommandable Comment faire mentir les cartes (1993, Flammarion.\n\n[2] Loïc Ravenel, Pascal Buléon et Jérôme Fourquet ont mis en évidence, pour la présidentielle de 2002, la progression du vote FN à mesure de l’éloignement des centres-villes. Plus récemment, Elsa Chavinier et Jacques Lévy ont identifié le même phénomène en Suisse.\n\n[3] La ville-centre désigne la commune formant le centre d’une agglomération, c’est-à-dire selon les limites administratives et à l’exclusion des communes de banlieue (par ex. Lyon «intra-muros»).",

    "article_text": "Technologie und Politik, das ist spätestens seit der Wahl Donald Trumps ein vergiftetes Thema. Vor ein paar Jahren, zu Zeiten des Arabischen Frühlings, glaubten viele noch an die positive Kraft sozialer Medien, heute herrscht vor allem Angst – vor „Fake News“, „Social Bots“ und Manipulations-Kampagnen auf Facebook. Diese seien schuld an der aktuellen US-Regierung, heißt es, am Brexit sowieso. Und was werden sie erst bei der bevorstehenden Bundestagswahl anrichten?\n\n„Technologie verändert die Art und Weise, wie wir in der Gesellschaft diskutieren und wie unsere Meinungsbildung stattfindet“, sagt Jochen König. „Aber das in allererster Linie nur als Gefahr zu sehen, finden wir falsch.“ König ist einer von zwei Gründern von Cosmonauts & Kings, dem nach eigener Aussage „ersten politischen Tech-Startup in Berlin“. Ja, der Einfluss von Technologie auf Politik und Wahlkämpfe löse Ängste aus, das sei verständlich. Aber: „Die Antwort von progressiven politischen Kräften kann nicht sein: Damit wollen wir lieber überhaupt nichts zu tun haben – und verlieren so vielleicht noch mehr den Zugang zu den Menschen als ohnehin schon“, sagt König.\n\nAnzeige\n\nDas Ziel ist, genau die richtige Zielgruppe online mit genau der richtigen Botschaft zu erreichen. Targeting heißt das im Fachjargon. Cosmonauts & Kings nutzt dazu Daten und Erfahrung: Die Daten kommen einerseits von den Kunden des Startups, bei einer Partei können das etwa E-Mail-Adressen von Unterstützern oder Mitgliederdatenbanken sein. Andererseits nutzen König, Schnöller und ihre Mitarbeiter die sozialen Netzwerke: 18- bis 25-Jährige im Großraum Berlin finden, die sich für das Bedingungslose Grundeinkommen interessieren? Aber nur solche, die schon mal bei Posts der Grünen auf „Gefällt mir“ geklickt haben? Bei Facebook ist das kein Problem.\n\nDie Erfahrung kommt von den Gründern: Schnöller (27) arbeitete für die Wiederwahl-Kampagne von Barack Obama, als er mit einem Stipendium in den USA studierte, später dann für die CDU im Bundestagswahlkampf 2013 und für die Europäische Volkspartei. König (30) war unter anderem Wahlkampfleiter für einen SPD-Bundestagskandidaten, „Head of Political Affairs“ bei den VZ-Netzwerken und für den Ringier-Verlag in Sachen Digital Business in Afrika unterwegs. Im Oktober 2016 gründeten die beiden ihr Unternehmen, das in Berlin derzeit sechs Mitarbeiter hat und bis Ende des Jahres auf 10 bis 15 anwachsen soll.\n\nDer Ruf der Branche ist angeknackst\n\nDoch das Image der Branche ist angeknackst. Die einen sagen ihr erschreckende Fähigkeiten nach, die anderen halten alles für Scharlatanerie. Kein Fall illustriert das besser als der der britischen Agentur Cambridge Analytica: Nach der US-Wahl 2016 hieß es, das Unternehmen habe Donald Trump mithilfe von Online-Persönlichkeitsprofilen und entsprechendem Targeting zum Sieg verholfen. Datenanalyse war plötzlich gleichbedeutend mit der Manipulation von Menschen. Doch dann tauchten Zweifel auf, Cambridge Analytica habe nie den Beweis erbracht, dass es überhaupt liefern konnte, was es versprach – sagten selbst die eigenen Kunden.\n\nAnzeige\n\nDer Bedarf für ihre Expertise sei jedenfalls da, versichern König und Schnöller, auch weil die klassischen Dienstleister hinterherhinkten. „Die etablierten Agenturen und Umfrageinstitute ziehen sich gern auf das Argument zurück, durch den deutschen Datenschutz sei alles so schwierig und ihre Möglichkeiten massiv eingeschränkt“, sagt König. „Aber das ist eine billige Ausrede. Mit dem, was existiert, ist sehr viel möglich.“ Gegen das schlechte Image der datengetriebenen politischen Kommunikation wehrt sich Cosmonauts & Kings. Gerade Targeting könne auch ein Lösungsansatz sein, zum Beispiel im Bezug auf Falschmeldungen in sozialen Medien: „Wenn ich sehe, dass Fake News kursieren, kann ich mein Targeting auch darauf ansetzen, Menschen zu informieren, dass es eine andere Perspektive auf das Thema gibt“, erklärt König.\n\nAktuell geschehe das größtenteils noch von Hand. „Wir wollen das, was wir tun, soweit automatisieren dass am Ende auch der Bürgermeisterkandidat einer kleinen sächsischen Stadt diese Fähigkeiten zur Verfügung hat“, sagt Schnöller. „Wir sind dann glücklich, wenn wir nicht wiederkommen müssen.“ König ergänzt: „Nur durch Automatisierung macht man die Technologie für jeden Menschen zugänglich.“ Und nicht zuletzt auch skalierbar.\n\nBild: Cosmonauts & Kings",

    "article_text": "Berlin/DüsseldorfMark Zuckerberg hat „Sorry“ gesagt – doch das reicht der Politik nicht. Nach der Anhörung im US-Senat fordern Abgeordnete und Minister weiterhin, Facebook und seinen Chef in die Schranken zu weisen. Auch in Deutschland: So mahnte Bundesjustizministerin Katarina Barley (SPD), dass der Konzern konkrete Verbesserungen für den Datenschutz vorschlagen müsse. Und kaum ein Digitalpolitiker ließ es sich nehmen, den Manager abzuwatschen.\n\nDie Kritik ist berechtigt, allerdings etwas scheinheilig. Die Parteien echauffieren sich gern über Verstöße gegen den Datenschutz bei Facebook und Co. Sie selbst aber nutzen deren Daten, um Wähler direkt und zielgenau anzusprechen. Auch den umstrittenen „Gefällt mir“-Knopf setzen viele trotz Bedenken von Datenschützern ein – darunter Ministerin Barley.\n\nDass Politiker Facebook und andere soziale Netzwerke nutzen, hält der Datenschützer Peter Schaar grundsätzlich für nachvollziehbar. „Die Parteien haben ein legitimes Interesse, dort aktiv zu sein, wo die Wählerinnen und Wähler sind“, sagt der Vorsitzende der Europäischen Akademie für Informationsfreiheit und Datenschutz (EAID) im Gespräch mit dem Handelsblatt.\n\nFacebook ist der Marktplatz der Nation, mehr als 31 Millionen Menschen in Deutschland nutzen den Online-Dienst.\n\nSchaar beobachtet jedoch eine „kognitive Dissonanz“: Viele Politiker kritisieren Facebook heftig für die Datenschutzpraktiken, nutzen die Plattform aber trotzdem – auch Funktionen, die umstritten sind. „Die Mentalität dahinter ist: Wasch’ mir den Pelz, aber mach’ mich nicht nass“, moniert der frühere Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte. „Da muss man schon fragen, inwieweit das kompatibel ist.“\n\nFacebook als Plattform für den Wahlkampf\n\nIm Bundestagswahlkampf ist Facebook inzwischen die wichtigste Plattform für die zielgenaue Ansprache der Wähler geworden. Man könnte „nach Alter, Geschlecht, Interessen oder Sprachen“ sortieren, heißt es in einem „Leitfaden für Politiker und Amtsträger“ des Internetkonzerns. „Wählen Sie aus vielfältigen Interessengebieten aus, wie zum Beispiel ‚Politik und soziale Themen‘, ‚Digitalisierung‘ oder ‚Sozialpolitik‘, um genau die richtigen Personen zu finden.“\n\nDas nutzten die Parteien gerne: Die CSU etwa veröffentlichte eine Wahlwerbung auf Russisch, die nur jene Nutzer zu sehen bekamen, die sich für den russischen Staatssender RT interessierten. Zielgruppe seien offenbar die Russlanddeutschen gewesen, schrieb die „Zeit“.\n\nUnd die FDP Schleswig-Holstein sprach gezielt Wähler an, die Fans des Elektroautoherstellers Tesla waren, indem sie für den Ausbau der Infrastruktur warb. Der Slogan: „Du kannst deine Zeit besser nutzen, als im Stau zu stehen.“ Bei Netflix-Nutzern wiederum stand der Breitbandausbau im Mittelpunkt.\n\nAlle im Bundestag vertretenen Parteien nutzten das Netzwerk, wie das Portal Netzpolitik.org im Wahlkampf dokumentierte. Dabei störten sie sich nicht an Bedenken, die Daten- und Verbraucherschützer gegen Facebook hegen. So hat das Landgericht Berlin eine Reihe von Klauseln für die Datennutzung für nichtig erklärt.\n\nUnter anderem darf der Konzern nicht per Voreinstellung dafür sorgen, dass die Profile von Nutzern einfach über Suchmaschinen auffindbar sind. Auch die Klarnamenpflicht ist demnach hinfällig. Das Unternehmen legt gegen das Urteil Berufung ein.\n\nÖffentlich geben die Parteien darüber relativ wenig preis. Allerdings hat CDU-Chefwahlkämpfer Peter Tauber Facebook nicht nur selbst genutzt – er wusste, dass er mehr potenzielle Wähler über das Netzwerk erreichen konnte als über seine Lokalzeitungen. Er und sein Wahlkampfteam haben für alle anderen Kandidaten auch ein Schulungsvideo erstellt.\n\n„Ich muss mir meine digitale Zielgruppe erarbeiten“, erklärte in dem Video Juri Schöller von der Agentur Cosmonauts & Kings. Über Facebook lasse sich feststellen, wo eine Zielperson wohne, welche Sprache sie spreche, wo sie arbeite, wie gebildet sie sei. So könne jeder Wahlkämpfer sein „Wording“ an die Wähler anpassen. Sogar das Einkommen könne Facebook anhand des Verhaltens ermitteln, was manchmal „etwas spooky ist“, wie der Marketingprofi zugibt.\n\nFacebook kann auch nachvollziehen, welche Nutzer sich für die Websites von Bundestagsabgeordneten interessieren – zumindest wenn sie beim Besuch im Onlinenetzwerk angemeldet sind. „Ich kann dann sagen, ich will Leute, die meine Seite in den letzten sechs Monaten besucht haben, ansprechen“, erklärte Schöller den CDU-Wahlkämpfern.\n\nSo ermittelt Facebook, wer sich für eine Partei interessiert und ermittelt das Potenzial in einem Wahlkreis, differenziert nach Personenkreisen.\n\nUmstrittene Gesichtserkennung: Betrogene Nutzer verklagen Facebook\n\nDie sozialen Netzwerke hatten noch eine weitere Funktion für die Parteien. „Es geht darum, die Botschaften in den Zielgruppen zu testen“, erklärten die CDU-Werber damals. So könne ein Thema unterschiedlich angesprochen und so erkannt werden, wann die potenziellen Wähler am besten darauf reagieren. „Das Zepter der digitalen Partei nicht den Wutmenschen überlassen“, so lautete das Motto, dass Schöller mit auf den Weg gab.\n\nAuf die Frage der Wahlkämpfer, wie viel Geld ausgegeben werden sollte, um seine Zielgruppe zu finden, sagte Schöller: „Jeder Euro ist ein Euro, den Du einsetzen solltest.“ Man sollte mit 100 Euro starten. Ein Facebook-Fan koste zwischen 40 und 90 Cent. Ein Like zwischen 5 und 10 Cent. „Ich halte 1000 Euro im Monat für angebracht.“ 1000 Euro für allein 298 Direktkandidaten in einem Bundestagswahlkampf, macht alleine 289.000 Euro für Facebook – pro Monat.\n\nDer umstrittene „Gefällt mir“-Knopf\n\nZur Datensammlung von Facebook tragen viele Politiker sogar direkt bei: So binden Dutzende Bundestagsabgeordnete den „Gefällt mir“-Knopf auf ihren Websites ein. Das Onlinenetzwerk erhält darüber automatisch Daten über alle Nutzer – und wenn diese beim Netzwerk eingeloggt sind, lässt sich der Besuch ihrem Profil zuordnen. So bekommt der Konzern ein umfassendes Bild über die Interessen der Nutzer, auch wenn sich diese außerhalb des Onlinenetzwerks bewegen. Wie genau das geschieht, legt Facebook auf Nachfrage amerikanischer Politiker mit einem neuen Blogeintrag offen.\n\nOb diese sogenannten Social Plugins, die es auch von Twitter und anderen Unternehmen gibt, gegen die Datenschutzgesetze verstoßen, ist juristisch mindestens umstritten. Das Landgericht Düsseldorf hat sie für rechtswidrig erklärt. Das Oberlandesgericht (OLG) Düsseldorf lässt nun vom Europäischen Gerichtshof klären, ob die Einbindung zulässig ist (Az. I-20 U 40/16).\n\nUm den Datenschutz zu gewähren, können Website-Betreiber eine Zwei-Klick-Lösung nutzen: Mit dem ersten Klick wird der „Gefällt mir“-Knopf aktiviert – und damit auch die Datenübertragung –, mit dem zweiten lässt sich die Empfehlung übermitteln. Erst dann erhält Facebook Daten über den Nutzer.\n\nDutzende Abgeordnete binden den „Gefällt mir“-Knopf auf ihren Websites ein, darunter Ministerin Barley. Sie teilt Besuchern ihrer Website in der Datenschutzerklärung mit, dass beim Besuch der Website „eine direkte Verbindung zwischen Ihrem Browser und dem Facebook-Server“ hergestellt werde. Wer das nicht will, dem wird im Kleingedruckten lapidar empfohlen: „Loggen Sie sich bitte aus Ihrem Facebook-Benutzerkonto aus.“\n\n„Die Zwei-Klick-Lösung wäre datenschutzrechtlich deutlich besser“, sagt Schaar. „Aber dann bekommt der Abgeordnete nicht die detaillierte Reichweitenanalyse.“ Der Datenschützer hält das für eine „rechtliche Grauzone“.\n\nIn die will sich Dorothee Bär (CSU), die Staatsministerin für Digitalisierung, nicht begeben: Die Buttons von Facebook und Twitter sind deaktiviert, zu erkennen an der grauen Farbe – erst mit einem Klick sind sie scharf geschaltet.",

Damit ihr euch nicht selbst durch das Internet klicken müsst, haben wir eine Vorauswahl getroffen, aus der ihr euren Liebling wählen könnt.\n\nÜberraschend auffällig, auch für uns, gibt es unter den Nominierten viele Fintechs – wie schon im Vorjahr. Zudem befindet sich darunter kein einziger klassischer Onlineshop, wir fanden andere Branchen und Ideen einfach spannender, wie Legaltech, Big Data oder Flugtaxis.\n\nJetzt habt ihr die Qual der Wahl: Findet unter diesen zwölf Nominierten euren Favoriten. Euer Kreuz dürft ihr nur einmal setzen. Ob ihr eure Freunde, Kollegen oder Kunden bittet, ebenfalls für eure Nummer eins zu stimmen, ist euch aber freigestellt.\n\nVideo: Im vergangenen Jahr konnte der Internet-Sender Rocket Beans den Newcomer-Award für sich gewinnen. Unsere Kollegin Hannah überraschte das Startup dafür live in der Sendung mit der (fast) goldenen Trophäe.\n\nDie nominierten Startups für den Newcomer-Award 2017\n\nCosmonauts & Kings\n\nJochen König und Juri Schnöller bezeichnen ihr Unternehmen als „das erste politische Tech-Startup in Berlin“: Cosmonauts & Kings hilft Parteien, Politikern und Interessensverbänden beim Targeting – dem Erreichen von Zielgruppen im Internet mit auf sie zugeschnittenen Botschaften. Dabei stützt sich das Startup auf Social-Media-Daten und die Erfahrung der Gründer im Wahlkampf-Geschäft. Wer die Kunden sind, hält Cosmonauts & Kings bislang geheim. Zum Jahresende ist die erste Finanzierungsrunde geplant.\n\nEnmacc\n\nIn der ersten Finanzierungsrunde im Februar gab es für Enmacc aus München drei Millionen Euro. Namhafte Geldgeber wie Cherry Ventures und Berlin Ventures sowie Gründer wie Jan Becker und Felix Haas investierten. Das Startup bietet eine digitale Kommunikationsplattform für den Energiehandel, auf der in Echtzeit Strom oder Gas ge- und verkauft werden kann. Gegründet wurde es von den früheren Energiehändlern Volker Puck und Marc Trieschmann, als CEO holten sie den Industriemanager Jens Hartmann mit an Bord.\n\nFreightHub\n\nFreighthub ist ein Full-Service-Spediteur, der den internationalen Frachtversand digitalisieren will. Das Startup fungiert als Vermittler zwischen Kunden und Reedereien und bietet einen transparenten Preisvergleich, Kundenservice und Echtzeit-Tracking an. Gegründet wurde Freighthub von den Heilemannbrüdern Fabian und Ferry mit Sitz in Berlin.\n\nHackerbay\n\nNur wenige Monate nach seinem Start konnte das Berliner Startup Hackerbay schon Unternehmen wie Twitter, Facebook und Lyft zu seinen Kunden zählen. Diese wenden sich mit Projektideen für Apps an das Unternehmen, das mithilfe eines automatisierten Tools einen kostenfreien Produktentwurf erstellt. Entscheidet sich der Kunde für die Umsetzung der App, sucht das Startup aus seinem Netzwerk an Entwicklern und Programmierern ein passendes Team dafür zusammen.\n\nKontist\n\nKontist bietet Selbstständigen und Kleinunternehmen ein kostenloses Geschäftskonto, das via App verwaltet werden kann. Zudem will das Berliner Startup administrativen Aufwand wie die Steuer- und Abgabenberechnung um 80 Prozent reduzieren. Noch vor dem offiziellen Start sammelte das Unternehmen zwei Millionen Euro von dem dänischen VC Founders und dem Fonds Vækstfonden ein.\n\nLemoncat\n\nOb Weihnachtsfeiern, After-Work-Parties oder Messebesuche: Bei dem Berliner Startup Lemoncat können Geschäftskunden Catering online bestellen oder durch Event Manager planen lassen. Dafür erhalten sie auf einem Online-Marktplatz eine Auswahl an Anbietern aus mehreren deutschen Großstädten. Gegründet wurde Lemoncat von Doreen Huber, die vorher als COO den Lieferdienstvermittler Delivery Hero mitaufgebaut hat. Um sich von der Konkurrenz abzuheben, konzentriert sie sich gezielt auf Firmenkunden und Caterings für größere Gruppen. Zehn bis 15 Prozent pro Bestellung behält die Firma für die Vermittlung ein.\n\nLilium Aviation\n\nStoff, aus dem eigentlich nur Science-Fiction-Filme sind: Daniel Wiegand, Sebastian Born, Matthias Meiner und Patrick Nathen haben das weltweit erste elektrisch angetriebene Flugzeug entwickelt, das sowohl senkrecht starten und landen als auch vorwärts fliegen kann. All das leiser und schneller als ein Auto. In diesem Frühjahr absolvierte der Jet seinen Jungfernflug, nun hat das 2015 gegründete Unternehmen Kapital für die Entwicklung einer größeren Variante geholt: Der chinesische Internetkonzern Tencent und andere Geldgeber investierten insgesamt 90 Millionen Dollar in Lilium, das seinen Sitz in Gilching bei München hat.\n\nNextmarkets\n\nDas Kölner E-Learning Startup Nextmarkets will seinen Nutzern die Börse erklären. Dafür stehen über die Plattform nach eigenen Angaben 14 Börsen-Coaches mit ihrer Expertise zur Verfügung. Sehen diese zum Beispiel eine passende Gelegenheit, Aktien zu handeln, benachrichtigen sie die Nutzer per E-Mail oder SMS. „Curated Investing“ nennen die Gründer Manuel und Dominic Heyden das.\n\nPrintPeter\n\nPrintPeter bietet Studenten an, Skripte kostenlos für sie auszudrucken und ihnen zuzusenden. Finanziert werden soll das Ganze durch Firmen, die auf den Seiten der Uni-Dokumente Anzeigen schalten. Diese kosten laut Angabe des Berliner Startups bis zu zwei Euro pro Stück. Im Frühjahr 2016 haben die Foodexpress-Gründer Max von Waldenfels und Benjamin Pochhammer das Unternehmen gemeinsam mit den Gründern Cecil von Croÿ und Karl Bagusat gestartet.\n\nRightmart\n\nDas Bremer Legaltech-Startup Rightmart prüft für seine Kunden Hartz-IV-Bescheide. „Es geht darum, Fehler zu identifizieren, beispielsweise, wenn Einkommen aus Nebenjobs falsch angerechnet wird“, erklärt COO Marco Klock. Bei fehlerhaften Bescheiden fertigt das System dann einen Widerspruch an, den ein menschlicher Bearbeiter noch einmal ergänzt und an das Jobcenter schickt. Bald wollen die vier Gründer Klock, Jan Strasmann, Philipp Harsleben und Philipp Hammerich sich auch Bafög- und Bussgeldbescheide vornehmen.\n\nSolarisbank\n\nDie Solarisbank ist ein Geldinstitut mit deutscher Vollbank-Lizenz, die es Unternehmen ermöglicht, eigene Finanzprodukte anzubieten. Fintech-Startups haben oft selbst keine solche Lizenz und müssen daher mit Banken zusammenarbeiten, die zum Beispiel Kundengelder lagern und Zahlungen durchführen. Oft ist die Technologie der Startups aber viel fortgeschrittener als die der regulären Banken. Die Solarisbank bietet den Fintechs moderne Lösungen. Dafür sammelte das Startup mit Sitz in Berlin im Frühjahr 26 Millionen Euro ein.\n\nZenjob\n\nZenjob vermittelt Studenten für Zeitarbeit an Unternehmen und verspricht ihnen dafür einen Stundenlohn von mindestens zehn Euro. Abgewickelt wird alles über eine App. Gegründet wurde das Berliner Startup unter anderem von Fritz Trott. Der Ex-Rocket arbeitete zuvor etwa für das Samwer-Unternehmen Foodpanda, als Büroleiter im EU-Parlament und gründete eine NGO und den Radiosender Welle21.\n\n\n\n\n\n&amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=“https://polldaddy.com/poll/9827544/“&amp;amp;amp;gt;Welches Startup soll den Gründerszene Newcomer-Award bekommen?&amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\nAnmerkung: Die Abstimmung endet am 20. September 2017 um 23:59 Uhr. Für die Nominierungen zum Newcomer-Preis kamen nur Unternehmen in Frage, die 2016 mit ihrem Produkt gestartet sind oder in dem Jahr erstmalig von sich reden machten. Das Gründungsdatum spielte nur eine untergeordnete Rolle.\n\nBild: Hannah Scherkamp / Gründerszene",

    "article_text": "Bei der Agentursuche hatte die AfD nicht immer Glück. Im Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus-Wahlkampf war im vergangenen Jahr kein deutsches Unternehmen bereit, Plakate für die Partei gestalten. Für ihre Digitalkampagne zur Bundestagswahl haben die Rechtspopulisten nun aber einen Dienstleister gefunden, der kaum besser zu ihnen passen könnte.\n\nAnzeige\n\nWie der Spiegel berichtet, hat die AfD die US-amerikanische Werbeagentur Harris Media engagiert. Deren Kundenliste liest sich wie ein Who’s Who der politischen Rechten: Für die israelische Regierungspartei Likud hat sie schon gearbeitet, für die britischen Europafeinde von UKIP und für Donald Trump. Am bekanntesten sind das Unternehmen und sein Gründer Vincent Harris aber als diejenigen, „die das republikanische Internet erfunden haben“, wie es das Wirtschaftsmagazin Bloomberg einmal ausdrückte.\n\n2012 verhalf Harris dem damals noch unbekannten Tea-Party-Kandidaten Ted Cruz mit Social Media und Bloggerkontakten zum Sieg in den Senatsvorwahlen – nur um kurz darauf öffentlich in der New York Times das Versagen der Republikaner um Mitt Romney im Online-Präsidentschaftswahlkampf anzuprangern. Bis junge Techies wie er in der Partei etwas zu sagen hätten, werde es wohl noch 20 Jahre dauern, gab sich der damals 24-Jährige bescheiden.\n\nDoch es kam anders, zahlreiche Republikaner engagierten Harris als Digitalexperten, darunter einflussreiche Senatoren wie Mitch McConnell oder Rand Paul und Präsidentschaftskandidaten wie Newt Gingrich oder Rick Perry. Schließlich wurde auch die Trump-Kampagne auf ihn aufmerksam, beendete die Zusammenarbeit jedoch schnell wieder, nachdem die Nachrichtenwebsite Politico sie öffentlich gemacht hatte. Woran genau Harris für Trump gearbeitet hatte, blieb unklar.\n\nKulturschocks in der Parteizentrale\n\nDer Texaner gründete seine Agentur 2008 in seinem College-Wohnheim, sie hat ihren Sitz in Austin und nach eigenen Angaben 45 Mitarbeiter. Parallel zum CEO-Posten lehrt er an seiner ehemaligen Hochschule, der Baylor University, Politikwissenschaften. Harris ist tiefreligiöser Protestant, wie viele republikanische Stammwähler, hasst jedoch laut Bloomberg den Quasi-Haussender der Partei, Fox News.\n\nAnzeige\n\nDabei würde sein Kampagnenstil durchaus zu diesem passen. Vergangenen Herbst machte im Netz etwa ein Video namens „Welcome to the Islamic State of Germany“ die Runde. Darin zu sehen: Halbmonde auf dem Kölner Dom, IS-Flaggen am Brandenburger Tor, ein alkoholfreies Oktoberfest – die Dschihadisten haben die Macht übernommen. Erstellt hatte es Harris Media und gedacht war es für den US-Wahlkampf, Trump-Anhänger wollten damit ein Schreckensszenario für den Fall eines Wahlsiegs von Hillary Clinton zeichnen, die sie als „Amerikas Angela Merkel“ bezeichneten. „Es zeigt eine Zukunft, die verhindert werden kann, wenn der Westen gegen radikalen Islam zusammensteht“, kommentierte Vincent Harris damals in der Berliner Morgenpost.\n\nEine Botschaft, die der AfD gefallen haben dürfte, in der Berliner Parteizentrale gehen die Harris-Leute laut Spiegel mittlerweile ein und aus. Und sorgten wohl schon für Kulturschocks: Einer der Werber soll einen AfD-Politiker gefragt haben, warum die Rechtspopulisten nicht einfach mit „Germany for Germans“ werben. Grob übersetzt: „Deutschland den Deutschen“, eine Nazi-Parole.\n\nBild: Getty Images / Kris Connor\n\nMehr zum Thema digitaler Wahlkampf:",

    "article_text": "Politik fängt ja im Kleinen an, bei den zerschlissenen Polstermöbeln auf den Bordsteigen von Neukölln zum Beispiel, Christina Schwarzer weiß das. Sie sitzt früh am Morgen in einem türkischen Frühstückscafé nahe dem Herrmannplatz, wischt über ihr Handy, ihr Facebook-Newsfeed gleitet vorbei, Fotos, eine Aufnahme des Abendhimmels über Rudow, ihre Wahlplakate, dazwischen Nachrichten, es geht um vollgelaufene Keller im Blumenviertel, die Personalnot in einem Neuköllner Reha-Zentrum und eben das Problem mit dem illegalen Müll. Eine bodenständige Mischung, aber dahinter steckt Kalkül.\n\nMan muss es tatsächlich lernen – Christina Schwarzer ist CDU-Bundestagsabgeordnete und Mitglied im Ausschuss digitale Agenda. Sie hat beschlossen, ihr Agieren in den Sozialen Medien zu professionalisieren. Markus Wächter / Waechter Foto:\n\nDie Politikerin will, dass sich die Wähler auf Facebook von ihr angesprochen fühlen – mit Themen, die für sie eine Rolle spielen: „Die Leute sollen wissen: Wofür steht Frau Schwarzer eigentlich?“\n\n\n\nVom Einzelfall abhängig\n\nSchwarzer ist CDU-Politikerin, Bundestagsabgeordnete, Mitglied im Ausschuss digitale Agenda, eine kräftige Frau, rötliche Haare, pastellfarbener Blazer. Ihr Facebook-Profil gestaltet sie gemeinsam mit zwei Mitarbeitern, einer davon ist Philipp Gräfe, der neben ihr auf der Bank sitzt, ein Fachmann für digitale Kommunikation. „Wir überlegen uns genau, mit welchen Themen wir welche Zielgruppen erreichen“, sagt sie, einmal pro Woche setzen sie sich zusammen, um Ideen für Posts zu entwickeln, Gräfe sagt: „Wir versuchen zu zeigen, dass da ein echter Mensch ist und kein bloßer Anzugträger.“\n\nDie Art und Weise, wie Politiker kommunizieren, hat sich grundlegend verändert: Früher verschickten Abgeordnete Pressemitteilungen an die Journalisten; zu ihren Wählern sprachen sie meist nur von Podien herunter. Das tun sie zwar weiter. Zusätzlich aber steht ihnen in den Sozialen Medien eine Plattform zur Verfügung, auf der sie ihre Botschaften ins Land tragen, Debatten beeinflussen und Menschen einnehmen können. Auch im Bundestagswahlkampf spielen die Netzwerke erstmals eine große Rolle: In Wahlkampfzentralen aller Parteien gibt es Strategen, die nur für die digitale Kampagne zuständig sind; doch wie erfolgreich die Kandidaten das Internet einsetzen, hängt stark vom Einzelfall ab.\n\nBissige Kommentare\n\nEinige haben noch gar kein Facebook-Profil, bei vielen wirken die digitalen Auftritte ziemlich dilettantisch, manche profitieren von überproportional starken Reichweiten: Niema Movassat etwa, ein relativ unbekannter Abgeordneter der Linken aus Oberhausen, lässt mit knapp 20.000 Likes so manchen prominenten Politiker hinter sich. Die Vorteile, die ihm die Sozialen Medien bieten, nutzt er bewusst. „Ich kann direkt mit meinen Wählern kommunizieren, bekomme Fragen, kann gleich antworten und kriege bestimmte Stimmungen mit“, sagt er, „das alles ist wichtig im Wahlkampf.“\n\nMovassat, ein eher kleiner Mann Anfang 30 mit rundlichen Wangen, spurtet an einem Nachmittag Ende Juli die Treppe des Bundestagsgebäudes hoch, er ist gerade aus seinem Wahlkreis zurückgekehrt. In seinem Büro lässt er sein Gepäck fallen. Aus einer Tasche springt sein Chihuahua, der Hund hat auch ein eigenes Facebook-Profil, aber nur 200 Likes. Movassat erzielt seine Wirkung vor allem mit zum Teil bissigen Kommentaren zu aktuellen Nachrichten; zuletzt ging es um die Ablösesumme des brasilianischen Fußballstars Neymar, um den Dieselskandal und die Großspenden an die FDP, ein bunter Strauß linker Aufregerthemen also.\n\n\n\nMehr als 200.000 Menschen erreicht\n\nDer Politiker sinkt in einen Sessel, nimmt sein Handy, ein paar Klicks, dann erscheint seine Facebook-Statistik, 213.983 Menschen hat er in der vergangenen Woche erreicht, 73 Prozent der Vorwoche. „Klar“, sagt er, „da waren die G20-Proteste“, er hatte eine Vielzahl von Beiträgen gepostet, Fotos von den Protesten, Berichte von Polizeigewalt: „Da gab es ständig etwas, was die Leute bewegt.“\n\nMovassat kennt aber auch die hässliche Seite der digitalen Wirklichkeit. Er hat schon viel Hass im Internet abgekriegt, Beleidigungen, rassistische Anfeindungen. Anfangs hat ihn das mitgenommen, sagt er, „mittlerweile ist mein Fell dick“. Er weiß, wie schnell die Stimmung im Netz kippen kann. Je stärker Politiker die Plattformen nutzen, umso relevanter wird die Frage, ob sie letztlich Populisten und Demagogen nutzen: Fehlinformationen, Propaganda-Roboter, Hackerangriffe – all das sind mächtige Instrumente: „Die Manipulationen werden zunehmen. Das ist ein Risiko – es stört die sachliche Debatte und ich glaube, dass wir das jetzt im Wahlkampf zum ersten Mal erleben werden.“\n\n\n\nEine gefährliche Mischung\n\nFacebook hat 32 Millionen Nutzer in Deutschland. Wann immer sie liken oder Posts teilen, geben sie Aufschluss darüber, wie sie denken und auf Ideen oder Argumente reagieren. All diese digitalisierten Regungen werden gesammelt, gespeichert und kommerziell verfügbar gemacht. „Daten sind das neue Öl“, sagt Vincent Venus, Politikberater und Mitarbeiter am Think Tank Das Progressive Zentrum in Berlin. „Ihr Wert besteht darin, dass man damit in der Lage ist, die Vergangenheit zu analysieren und die Zukunft vorherzusagen.“\n\nVenus, 28 Jahre, springt in einer Seitenstraße von Moabit vom Fahrrad und steuert ein Straßencafé an. Er hat 2014 in Texas den Wahlkampf einer Statehouse-Kandidatin mitkonzipiert und hilft jetzt deutschen Politikern, die Netzwerke zu nutzen. „Facebook ist für uns Campaigner ein Riesending“, sagt er. Venus begeistert sich für die digitalen Werkzeuge. Aber er weiß, dass sie missbraucht werden können. „Die technischen Möglichkeiten sind unbegrenzt, deswegen brauchen wir Regeln.“ Sonst sei nicht zu verhindern, dass antidemokratische Akteure lernen, die Meinung der Massen immer stärker zu beherrschen. Als Beispiel nennt er Donald Trump, „jemanden, der autoritär ist, viel Macht hat und so viele Daten, dass er Entscheidungen vorhersagen kann – das ist eine gefährliche Mischung“.\n\n„Man ist schon in seiner Filterblase“\n\nDie Situation in Deutschland ist längst nicht mit der in den USA zu vergleichen. Die Politiker haben erst angefangen, ihren Spielraum auszutesten. „Man muss es tatsächlich lernen“, sagt Christina Schwarzer in dem Neuköllner Café, „und ich habe mich entschlossen, mein Handeln in den Sozialen Medien zu professionalisieren.“ Sie hat knapp 3500 Fans auf Facebook, 3200 Follower auf Twitter und rund 900 Abonnenten auf Instagram. „Viele Leute benutzen Facebook als Nachrichtenkanal“, sagt sie und muss dabei gegen den Lärm ringsum anreden, das Stimmengewirr, das Klappern der Teller und Tassen.\n\n\n\nMit der richtigen Botschaft die richtigen Leute erreichen – Juri Schnöller (l.) und Jens König von Cosmonauts & Kings beraten Parteien, Politiker, NGOs und Verbände.\n\nSie hat gleich einen Termin in der Nähe, eine Pressekonferenz, der Deutsche Kinderverein stellt eine Kampagne zum Thema Schütteltrauma vor; sie wird später das dazugehörige Video posten. Jeden Tag stellt sie einen Beitrag auf ihr Profil, ein Foto, das sie beim Döneressen zeigt, oder einen Artikel über arabische Clans. Aber sie macht sich nichts vor: Ihre Beiträge werden vor allem von denen gelesen, die der CDU nahestehen. Die Öffentlichkeit ist in den Sozialen Medien immer nur eine Teilöffentlichkeit. Meinungen spiegeln einander, Positionen bekräftigen sich. „Man ist schon in seiner Filterblase“, sagt ihr Mitarbeiter, Gräfe selbst hat zunächst beim Radio gearbeitet, dann in der Pressestelle eines Nahverkehrsunternehmens. „Jetzt habe ich mehr politische Themen in meiner Timeline. Früher wusste ich alles über Busse und Bahnen.“\n\nEine Branche ist entstanden\n\nDer Linke Niema Movassat macht seine Facebook-Seite noch selbst. „Manche Dinge plant man“, sagt er, „manche Dinge sind Bauchgefühl.“ In seinen Bürgersprechstunden, sagt er, sitzt er dieser Tage meist alleine da. Auf Facebook fragen die Leute nach, wollen diskutieren. Aber dort bestimmt Facebook, wie das Gespräch verläuft, der Algorithmus begünstigt Videos, deshalb nimmt er jetzt öfter Clips von sich auf, er sagt: „Ich glaube, dass Facebook keine Straßenwahl ersetzt, aber es ist entscheidend, wenn man ein jüngeres Publikum erreichen will.“\n\nFacebook mit seinem riesigen Datenfundus kennt die Neigungen, Interessen und Ängste der Wähler besser als jedes Forschungsinstitut. Inzwischen ist eine ganze Branche entstanden, die Daten verwertbar macht, Datenanalysefirmen, Dateningenieure, Agenturen, die datengetriebene PR anbieten.\n\n\n\nDatenbasierte politische Kommunikation\n\nAuch das Geschäftsmodell der Firma Cosmonauts & Kings stützt sich auf die Daten von Social-Media-Nutzern. „Wir machen datenbasierte politische Kommunikation und Kampagnen. Das ist das, womit wir uns beschäftigen“, sagt Jochen König, einer der beiden Firmengründer.\n\nMit seinem Kompagnon Juri Schnöller sitzt er im obersten Stock der Factory Berlin, einer Art Businessclub für die Digitalbranche, ringsum Rohbetonwände, viel Glas, dezentes Hipsterdekor. Schnöller, 27 Jahre alt, mit Brille und Hemd, König, 30 Jahre, mit weißem T-Shirt und Sakko, haben ihre Firma vor weniger als einem Jahr gegründet, wie sie sagen: das erste politische Start-up in Berlin.\n\nDaten und Politik – ein schwieriges Thema\n\nIn ihrem Büro sei zu wenig Platz, deshalb der Termin in der Factory. Man merkt, wie vorsichtig sie sind. Wer ihre Kunden sind, sagen sie nicht, nur, dass sie für Parteien, Politiker, NGOs und Verbände arbeiten. Daten und Politik – das ist ein verbranntes Thema; vor allem der Wahlsieg Trumps hat die Sozialen Medien als Vehikel für Lügen und Propaganda in Verruf gebracht.\n\n\n\nSchnöller hat Politik studiert, unter anderem in Washington, und 2012 an Obamas Kampagne mitgewirkt. König, studierter Staatswissenschaftler, hat Stationen als Wahlhelfer eines SPD-Kandidaten, bei den VZ-Netzen und als Fondsmanager hinter sich. Vereinfacht ausgedrückt kann man sagen: Sie helfen ihren Kunden, mit der richtigen Botschaft die richtigen Leute zu erreichen. Dazu nutzen sie die Informationen, die ihre Auftraggeber zur Verfügung stellen; E-Mail-Adressen von Mitgliedern, Telefonnummern oder Social-Media-Daten. Jochen König sagt: „Es geht darum, dass wir uns erst mal anschauen: Welche Reichweiten bestehen? Wie sieht die soziodemografische Zusammensetzung aus? Wie kann es geschafft werden, die Reichweiten zu erhöhen?“\n\nExtrem viele Daten pro Tag\n\nWelches die richtigen Instrumente sind, hängt ganz von den Zielen der Kampagne ab: Sollen möglichst viele den Post sehen? Sollen die eigenen Anhänger mobilisiert werden? Oder gilt es, Nutzer zu überzeugen, die anderer Meinung sind? Facebook hat für alles die richtigen Angebote. Schnöller und König entwerfen Anzeigen, testen sie in verschiedenen Zielgruppen, ziehen Schlussfolgerungen. Welcher Ton trifft den Nerv, welche Bilder lösen die gewünschten Reaktionen aus?\n\nVieles ist möglich, auch gezielte Manipulationen, Schnöller und König bestreiten das nicht. Ihnen geht es darum, die Vorteile zu nutzen. Welchen positiven Effekt kann Technologie auf die Demokratie haben? Wie können die Bürger selbst über ihre Daten bestimmen? „Wir produzieren jeden Tag mit unseren Smartphones extrem viele Datenpunkte, und die werden von Unternehmen genutzt“, sagt Jochen König. „Wie kann ich aber meine Daten und die Kontakte für meine politischen Anliegen nutzen?“\n\n\n\n„Keiner legt sich so einen Twitternamen zu“\n\nChristina Schwarzer hat eine Frage, die sie möglichst vielen Menschen in Neukölln stellen will: „Möchtest du im Müll leben?“ Wer sich in dem Bezirk im Internet einloggt und Google aufruft, bekommt sie mit einiger Wahrscheinlichkeit angezeigt. Dafür bezahlt die Politikerin dem Suchdienst Geld. Ein Klick, und schon landet der Nutzer auf eine Unterseite von Schwarzers Website. 1,3 Prozent der Nutzer landen auf Schwarzers Seite – das ist ein guter Wert. Für digitale Anzeigen gibt die Abgeordnete jeden Monat dreistellige Beträge aus. „Man kommt um diese Anzeigen nicht mehr herum, wenn man gezielt Menschen für bestimmte Aktionen ansprechen möchte“, sagt sie.\n\nDoch ihr ist klar, dass die Digitalisierung mit neuen Unsicherheiten einhergeht. Gerade in der Phase vor der Wahl rechnet sie mit Cyberangriffen. Seit drei, vier Wochen merkt sie, dass auf ihrem Twitterprofil extrem viele Socialbots andocken, gefälschte Profile, hinter denen kein Mensch steckt, sondern ein Programm. Manchmal meldet der Dienst ihr mehr als 100 neue Follower an einem einzigen Tag, doch auf den Profilen gibt es weder Fotos noch persönliche Angaben. Schwarzer deutet auf ihr Handy, geht ihre Follower durch. „Gucken Sie sich das an. Keiner legt sich so einen Twitternamen zu“, nur wirre Zahlen- und Buchstabenketten sind das. Dann steckt sie ihr Handy weg, gleich muss sie los. Im Gehen dreht sie sich noch einmal um und sagt: „Man muss auf der Hut sein und bleiben.“ Gut möglich, dass da noch einiges kommt. Der Wahlkampf hat gerade erst angefangen.",

The Political consultancy has come under increased scrutiny in recent weeks after Facebook suspended it for violating Facebook's privacy policies.\n\nIn a secretly recorded meeting with a journalist posing as a potential client, one of the firm’s executive boasts told Channel 4 about their experience in political campaign affirming they analyze vast amounts of personal data to know “who to target and with what message… We’ve done it in Mexico,” he said.\n\nThe firm’s tactics go well beyond data gathering and analysis. Cambridge Analytica boss Alexander Nix is seen in the video plainly speaking of his firm's use of entrapments tactics, such as sending “somebody posing as a wealthy developer” to speak to incumbents, or “some girls around to a candidate’s house” and produce instant evidence of corruption or scandalous behaviour by filming the exchanges.\n\nMexico’s presidential and legislative elections will be held on July 2018. However, the General Attorney’s office specialized in electoral crimes has not launched any investigations yet arguing they “require someone to file a complaint” to investigate.\n\nIn Argentina, authorities are not waiting for an official request, and the National Electoral Chamber of the judicial branch has opened an investigation to find evidence of Cambridge Analytica’s work in the country.\n\nPromotional materials unearthed by Bloomberg also revealed that firm launched a partnership with Pig.gi, a Spanish-language, Android-only phone app that prompted users to view advertisements and to read sponsored stories in exchange for free internet access and call minutes. The partnership according to the materials seemed designed to target persons in Mexico and Colombia.\n\nBrittany Kaiser, Cambridge's vice president, told Bloomberg last year that the company was transparently designed to influence the votes of younger Mexicans. The app reportedly had 200,000 users as of last year.\n\n“Pig.gi has already been hugely successful in Mexico and Colombia,\" now-embattled CEO Alexander Nix announced last year via a news release. \"We’re thrilled to be partnering with the app so that their partners can get the right message to the right people at the right time.\"\n\n“Pig.gi has already been hugely successful in Mexico and Colombia,\" CEO Alexander Nix announced last year via a news release. \"We’re thrilled to be partnering with the app so that their partners can get the right message to the right people at the right time.\"\n\nBoth Mexico and Colombia will hold presidential elections this year.\n\n“Early Monday, as soon as the scandal broke worldwide, it was instructed to the body of auditors and the corresponding offices that deal with party funding to look if the aforementioned company appears in some of the last presidential and legislative elections,” an official source told El Pais.\n\nThis task will prove difficult given that, as mentioned in the video, the company does not use its name to contract.\n\nIn the secret video, one of the firm’s executives says “we’re now moving into Brazil.” Brazilians will also head to the polls this year, in October.\n\nAccording to Reuters, prosecutors for Brazil’s Federal District said in a statement they would look into whether the firm, through its partnership with Sao Paulo-based consulting group A Ponte Estratégia Planejamento e Pesquisa LTDA, illegally used the data of millions of Brazilians to create psychographic profiles.\n\nThe issue is not only data collecting. The video confirms participation in the Kenyan elections of 2013 and 2017, running incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta’s campaign characterized by the use of incendiary messages and false news. We ran “every element of his campaign.”\n\nHe also discloses links to former MI6 agents and Israeli intelligence companies who provide Cambridge Analytica’s clients with a report on “all the skeletons” in their opponents’ closet.",

    "article_text": "The abuse of Facebook’s platform for political purposes is a problem that doesn’t stop at the U.S border. Governments around the world are continuing to wrestle with the implications of Cambridge Analytica’s acquisition of Facebook user data from the heart of Europe to the capitals of Latin America’s most populous nations.\n\nIn South America, several chapters are still being written into the public record of Facebook’s privacy privations. Some Latin American democracies are also beginning to investigate whether the data harvesting techniques associated with Cambridge Analytica (CA) were used in their electoral processes.\n\nFacebook, Cambridge Analytica and South America: a recap\n\nBrazil\n\nThe Brazilian Public Prosecutor’s Office started an investigation to clarify if Cambridge Analytica (CA) had illegal access to Facebook’s private information from millions of Brazillians through their subsidiary, a Sao Paulo-based consulting group named A Ponte Estratégia Planejamento e Pesquisa LTDA.\n\nThe investigation came as a result of Cambridge Analytica Chief Data Officer Dr Alex Tayler and Managing Director Mark Turnbull saying to an undercover journalist that the company was now targeting Brazil, among other countries. The Brazilian case is a big deal for Facebook because it is its third-largest market and has an election coming in seven months.\n\nArgentina\n\nCambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Group, has an office in Buenos Aires which address matches with the office of an Argentinian agricultural enterprise called Blacksoil, according to the news outlet, Clarin. The article pointed out that Alexander Nix, former CA’s CEO, was friend of the owner of the company, Lucas Talamoni Grether with whom he had conducted business before.\n\nThe Argentinian National Electoral Chamber (CNE), which is in charge of overseeing the elections and auditing campaign contributions and expenses, initiated an “internal investigation” following the scandal revealed by British TV Channel 4. Political parties are accusing one another of using CA services in the 2017 midterm election but there is no hard evidence either supporting or refuting the allegations.\n\nMexico and Colombia\n\nMexico, the fifth largest market for Facebook, is also involved in the Cambridge Analytica debacle. In the same video that CA executives mention targeting Brazil, they admit having operated in Mexico using an app called Pig.Gi. Mexico’s general election are due on July 1st. The same app was used to access data from Colombian users, according to the tech site Hipertextual.\n\nNevertheless, Pig.Gi’s founder and CEO, Joel Phillips, admitted signing a deal with the data company but says the information never got to their hands and there is no evidence that the company had any access to personal data from Mexicans or Colombians, according to the same article.\n\nApart from being named by Alexander Nix in the video leak which blew up the scandal, there isn’t much empirical evidence of Cambridge Analytica actually tampering with South American electoral processes. However ineffectual Cambridge Analytica’s efforts have been, Facebook is still on the hook when it comes to “fake news” and misinformation in the region.\n\nMisinformed emerging democracies\n\nDuring the Argentinian electoral process in 2017 hundreds of fake articles were distributed through Facebook. A fact-checking site called Chequeado compiled some of the misinformation that was distributed on the platform.\n\nAmong them there were reports accusing the leader of a Teacher’s Union of not being a teacher; of the Buenos Aires Province Governor raising her own salary by 100% and even a claim that the US Government recorded Macri’s Administration as being the most corrupt in the world.\n\nThere were some sites created for the sole purpose of spreading Fake News on Facebook and these pieces went viral over and over again.\n\nOn the other hand, Brazil has steadily become a fake news heaven. The political instability that reigns in the country has made it easier for fake news to spread within fanatic circles. The Monitor Do Debate Politico No Meio Digital, an organization that follows the trail of political news in Social Networks, told El Pais that there are lots of sites which are not officially developing a systematic campaign of fake news prior to the October elections but have begun spreading fake reports in the social ecosystem.\n\nThis scheme is repeating itself throughout Latin American countries — and with the same characteristics. It’s not necessarily systemic, but it is growing. The difference remains in the plausibility of the pieces which were spread in the region.\n\nAlthough there were no conspiracy theories that compared candidates to a reptile, in South America stories did aim to enhance what people already thought of political figures.\n\nAccording to Luciano Galup, a social media strategist for political campaigns in the region, fake news are most effective in polarized societies. A study made by Oxford University in the US, showed that extremists tend to distribute more fake information than moderates within parties. And polarization is a major characteristic of the Latin American region’s political scenario. This makes Latin America the perfect victim for people trying to tamper with elections by presenting propaganda as actual news.\n\nIf we add that up with the lack of control from governments and Facebook attempts to solve the issue, we have a ticking time bomb. The only positive, Galup says, is that services like the ones on offer from Cambridge Analytica are prohibitively expensive for most political parties in Latin America.\n\nIn this case, the only thing saving elections in the region from outside corrupting influences may be the greed of those same corrupting influences.",

The blockchain-based platform connects airtime sponsors with smartphone subscribers, creating a decentralized mobile network powered by the value-transfer between users, providers, and brands.\n\n“In emerging markets, increased access to mobile connectivity creates new economic opportunities,” said Joel Phillips, co-founder and CEO of Siglo. “The Siglo protocol will empower smartphone users in these markets by eliminating the barriers that previously prevented them from participating in the digital economy.”\n\nIn Mexico, according to the World Bank, 61 per cent of adults are without a bank account and as of 2016, GSMA reported 85 per cent of smartphone connections in Latin America were prepaid. For these customers, earning 500MB of data requires 8-40 hours work (based on average wages and the cost of top-ups in Mexico and Brazil), and getting top-ups for mobile connectivity require traveling to supermarkets, gas stations or small street-side shops.\n\n“Siglo offers brands a scalable solution for connecting with customers in some of the fastest growing markets in the world,” said Isaac Phillips, co-founder of Siglo . “Key transactional pieces of the ecosystem benefit from immutable, auditable ledgers on the Ethereum blockchain, including brand transactions, user transactions and user-to-user transactions. By tokenizing access to mobile airtime, Siglo is facilitating unbanked users’ increased access to networks through incentivizing the creation of decentralized mobile networks.”\n\nBuilt upon the success of Pig.gi, an Android lock screen app used by more than one million smartphone owners in Mexico and Colombia to access the internet, the Siglo protocol adds a blockchain layer on top of a pre-existing off-chain data reward point, called the Pig.gi Coin. Launched in 2016, Pig.gi garnered more than one billion impressions for its brand partners, distributed 45 million Pig.gi coins to its users and amassed a wealth of new data that maps the customer journey from initial discovery to final transaction.\n\nTo provide top-ups at scale, the Siglo token will be launched as the first token to enable providers and brands with a way to directly reward consumers with mobile connectivity in exchange for engagement. The generation of Siglo tokens will fund the expansion of the platform that will tokenize access to airtime as well as expand the ecosystem in new and current markets.",

    "article_text": "Cambridge Analytica, the Anglo-American data and behavioral science firm that worked for Ted Cruz and Donald Trump–and that sparked an investigation in the U.K. and inquiries by U.S. lawmakers–has announced two initiatives in the past year that highlight some of the newer techniques in targeted advertising and the complex relationships that surround them.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSince last year’s presidential campaigns, the company has sought to expand further into targeted, or addressable, TV, an emerging type of data-driven ad technology that marketers and political campaigns can use to know not just what key audiences and voters like on TV and in other media, but also to determine what particular messages to show them and when. In an interview last month at the Advertising Week conference in New York, Duke Perrucci, Cambridge’s chief revenue officer, described the potential of new digital TVs and set-top boxes, and a future when targeted ads take up your whole screen. “Because you know the people in that home, and because you buy commercially available data, you know a lot about those people—there’s tons of data out there—now you can send those targeted ads specifically to those homes, the same way you would to a Facebook profile or to an Instagram account,” he said. While campaign dollars increasingly flow to internet ads–last year, spending on digital advertising eclipsed TV for the first time–television remains the ground zero of big ad campaigns, and the ad targeting and data capabilities in TV are starting to catch up to what’s used online. The idea is to allow candidates and brands to reach only those viewers who meet a desired demographic (e.g. potential buyer of motorcycle insurance). Rather than buying ads the old fashioned way during a certain program (a college football game, for instance) addressable TV allows advertisers to purchase an audience (like undecided Republicans). Cambridge’s efforts in addressable TV began last year. In October 2016, during the final stretch of the presidential campaigns, the company announced a partnership with cross platform analytics company ComScore to merge Cambridge Analytica’s “behavioral psychology and data analytics platform” with ComScore TV data, yielding insight “into which programs, stations and dayparts deliver the highest densities of the targeted audiences that the company’s clients seek to influence,” according to a statement about the partnership. Typically, Cambridge’s political work has drawn significant support from the conservative mega-donor Robert Mercer, and much of its work in U.S. elections has been for candidates Mercer supports. Steve Bannon, Breitbart News CEO and former advisor to President Trump, sat on Cambridge’s board of directors until late last year. But the TV data effort, as well as a mobile data tie-up in Mexico, have links with another lesser-known American billionaire family, one whose large campaign contributions tend to support Democrats. Charlie Ergen, founder of the broadcast satellite company Dish and the satellite equipment maker EchoStar, is said to be the richest man in Colorado, with a reported net worth of $18.8 billion. He is also a registered Democrat who was once a bundler for long-time friend John McCain ahead of his presidential bid in 2008. In 2016, Ergen and his wife hosted Clinton for a fundraiser at their home, where the candidate collected at least $750,000.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLast October, as part of the partnership with ComScore, viewer data from 52,000 households, including some Dish households, was set to eventually flow to Cambridge Analytica. ComScore taps Dish data thanks to ComScore’s acquisition of analytics company Rentrak, in January 2016. Dish has had close ties with Rentrak since 2008, and, after it acquired 7% of the company in 2012, it agreed to provide Rentrak with exclusive use of its set top box data. “DISH is a major partner that helped us change the measurement landscape by allowing massive and passive television measurement across a national footprint,” comScore’s CEO, Serge Matta, said in a 2016 statement. A spokesperson for ComScore was unable to describe the outcome of the Cambridge Analytica partnership. Representatives for Cambridge Analytica and Dish declined to comment for this story. In September, Cambridge’s new brand-focused unit, CA Commercial, announced its own ad targeting TV product, SelecTV, that it said it would roll out in the U.S. and U.K., followed by additional countries and markets in coming months. Available in more than half of all 119.6 million U.S. TV homes, and in every U.S. market, addressable TV “has finally reached a scale that has become very attractive to performance marketers,” Alexander Nix, Cambridge’s CEO, said in a statement. Born out of a recent campaign to promote a new un-named cable TV show, the technology, Nix said, has led to a “huge tuning uplift” over traditional age and gender targeting, an effect that is “additionally amplified when homes are exposed to both desktop and mobile advertising.” It’s not known yet if or how Cambridge intends to use addressable TV data during upcoming political campaigns, for instance, during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Dish is now America’s second-largest satellite TV operator and fourth-largest pay TV provider, and it’s also at the forefront of the ongoing battle to monetize set top box data to reach voters—one that, between digital and TV and a mix of the two—is expected to grow even hotter next year. In September, the company launched a new targeted TV ad program in partnership with Volvo, which can deliver targeted ads simultaneously on Dish and on the company’s Sling TV over-the-top service. Dish may have good reason to be casting about for innovative ways to bolster its TV business. While it earned $15 billion in revenue in 2016, its stock price has fallen more than 20% since July, and amid historic declines in TV viewership, it has seen a rapid drop-off in customers: during the third quarter, Dish lost another 129,000 pay TV subscribers, out of a nationwide base of around 13.7 million.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn a recent phone call with analysts, Ergen pointed to existing advertising as part of the problem. Traditional TV, he said, is “suffering declines in part because it’s not as good a product. It’s more expensive. Rates have gone up as viewership goes down. And the commercial load–you’re talking about 30% of the viewing minutes are commercials. That’s an unhealthy viewer experience,” Ergen said. “There’s things as an industry we can do to change that. If the industry starts thinking of creative ways to compete, that market can stabilize.” Targeting TVs The quest to target voters through TV is decades old and bipartisan. But practitioners say it was the Obama campaign in 2012 that signaled a breakthrough in using both social media and set-top box data in an effort to more precisely identify and persuade undecided voters. Rentrak, which is nonpartisan, collected the data and hired a third party to “anonymize” it so that the Obama team would only know that the information was coming from a set-top box of somebody on the persuadable list; personally identifying information would be stripped away. In the 2016 election, however, the Clinton campaign chose to build their own TV buying and targeting strategy, not to use a more advanced version of the Obama approach. “It’s frustrating when you build something that is available to both sides, and the side you personally support doesn’t use it,” Carol Davidsen, Obama’s TV ad guru, and now a comScore executive, told AdAge in February. (It’s not clear if Cambridge used the comScore system during its work for the Trump campaign.) US spending on addressable TV ads doubled in 2015 and is set to double again this year, but it’s still only a tiny piece of the ad pie: according to eMarketer, targeted TV ads will account for a mere $2.25 billion, or just under 3%, of all TV spending in 2018, and $3 billion in 2019. Among the efforts to grow those numbers is OpenAP, a system created by Viacom Inc., 21st Century Fox Inc. and Time Warner Inc.’s Turner that aims to standardize the targeting categories ad buyers can increasingly reach through TV. Google and Facebook are also investing in targeted television ads. “TV is still the strongest media you’ve got to get your message out, but it’s got a lot to learn from digital,” Perrucci, who has been leading Cambridge’s foray into the commercial sector, said at Advertising Week. “Why not take everything we know about the audience and use that to drive much more targeted TV?” But the combination of otherwise anonymous data on people’s TV viewing habits with social, demographic, psychographic, and other personal data is a growing privacy concern, argues Jonathan Albright, research director at Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. Few voters even know their watching patterns are being watched, whether by Dish or another provider.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\n“If you know [a voter] watch[es] Fox News at 5 p.m. every day and you also know from that addressable TV data—if someone has DirectTV, TiVo, whatever–how much of Fox News they watch, if they watch all of it or not. That kind of resolution is incredible,” he said. Most people don’t realize “that you can place and you can target like that to TV viewers.” Related: Bots Are Scraping Your Data For Cash Amid Murky Laws And Ethics Many cable operators use opt-out rather than opt-in consent, virtually guaranteeing that many citizens are unaware of how their data is used. In June 2016, communications advocacy group Public Knowledge filed complaints with the FCC and FTC over the technology, and singled out AT&T, Cablevision, and Comcast as the worst offenders. The group’s FCC complaint asserts that cable and satellite providers do not adequately obtain customer consent to use customer data, while the FTC complaint argues that the industry’s use of customer data without appropriate disclosures or opt-in consent amounts to an “unfair and deceptive” practice that’s in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. A Cambridge-Ergen Connection In Mexico TV isn’t the only domain where the Ergen family’s business intersects with the Trump data contractor. This summer, Cambridge announced that it would send content to Mexican phone subscribers in advance of their 2018 presidential election through an app that gives users ad-sponsored airtime or mobile internet. In Mexico, Cambridge Analytica signed an agreement with Pig.gi, an app in use there and in Colombia, in advance of next year’s presidential elections. Pig.gi offers users free airtime and/or email service on mobile phones in exchange for receiving sponsored content. It will allow Cambridge to collect information on and deliver advertising to the phones of 850,000 Mexicans; several political parties have expressed interest in the tie-up.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAmong Pig.gi’s investors are Charlie Ergen’s son, Chris Ergen, who’s worked in international business development at Dish since 2014, as well as Variv Capital, which has a joint venture in Mexico with Dish, and Pig.gi’s founders, Colorado brothers Joel and Isaac Phillips, who are connected with Chris Ergen in several vaporous businesses. Pig.gi, which is currently available for Android in Mexico and Colombia, says its users have seen advertising content half a billion times. “We’re thrilled to be partnering with the app so that their partners can get the right message to the right people at the right time,” Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix says on the company’s website. Many Mexicans are “undecided and unmotivated,” Brittany Kaiser, Cambridge’s vice president of business development, told Bloomberg. “There’s a huge opportunity in this country to find the issues that are important for people and actually turn people out to vote.” Meanwhile, Kaiser, who recently updated her Facebook page to say that she is living in Mexico City, lists Chris Ergen as one of her friends on Facebook. (After an emailed inquiry, the page is no longer publicly visible.) In February 2015, Kaiser was a moderator at a Washington meeting on “Digital Diplomacy” organized by the Digital Future Forum, a company started by Chris’s co-investors in Pig.gi, Joel and Isaac Phillips. Cambridge is also staffing up across Mexico in advance of next year’s elections. As BuzzFeed reported, Arielle Dale Karro, head of operations in Mexico for Cambridge Analytica, posted a job listing in the Facebook group “Foreigners in Mexico City” on October 23, seeking staff for gubernatorial campaigns in seven of Mexico’s 31 states: Chiapas, Guanajuato, Morelos, Puebla, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, and Veracruz. The company is also looking for someone to work in Mexico City. As of last week, however, Cambridge doesn’t appear in the National Registry of Suppliers of the National Electoral Institute (INE), which is a requirement for any firm that wants to be hired by a political party in Mexico.\n\nadvertisement",

    "article_text": "Los hermanos Joel e Isaac Phillips crearon Pig.gi, una startup que ofrece internet móvil a los millennials a cambio de ver publicidad.\n\nJune 21, 2017 6 min read\n\nLos hermanos Joel e Isaac Phillips siempre habían querido ser emprendedores. Pero antes de Pig.gi, en 2015, no habían tenido la oportunidad de dedicarse solamente a su propia empresa. Trabajaban en proyectos cortos en distintas compañías hasta que se dieron cuenta de que “para crear un startup hay que dedicar 150% del tiempo”, apunta Joel.\n\n\n\nMientras residían en Nueva York, Isaac y Joel descubrieron que la conectividad móvil era un mito, sobre todo en mercados emergentes como México y otros países de América Latina. Así que pensaron: ¿por qué no patrocinar el internet móvil con publicidad?, tal como las marcas pagan el tiempo al aire de la televisión abierta o las transmisiones de radio.\n\n\n\nEntonces, en 2015 nació el concepto de Pig.gi, una startup que ayuda al usuario final a ahorrar el costo de conectividad móvil; de ahí surgió el nombre, de piggy bank, que significa alcancía en inglés. Sin embargo, la plataforma fue lanzada hasta junio de 2016 en México y al final de ese año llegó a Colombia con inversión semilla de Ernesto y Diego Vargas, de la firma VARIV Capital.\n\n\n\n“Pig.gi es conectividad móvil patrocinada por marcas. Conectamos marcas a consumidores, y conectamos personas al internet. Es una app con la que ganas Pig.gi monedas por ver contenidos en tu pantalla de bloqueo, por contestar quizzes o por descargar otras apps”, explica Isaac.\n\n\n\nLas Pig.gi monedas no sólo se canjean por tiempo aire de cualquier operador móvil, sino también por otros premios como tarjetas de regalo y boletos del cine. Es así como las marcas pueden llevar sus mensajes a los millennials y a los centennials, que ya no se enganchan fácilmente con los medios tradicionales.\n\nTe puede interesar: Los mexicanos que regalan dinero para competirle a American Express\n\nEste modelo de negocio llamó la atención de Google, que cada año reúne a un diverso grupo de startups de Norteamérica y los lleva a Silicon Valley a exhibir su innovadora tecnología y a conocer inversionistas y mentores durante el Google Demo Day, que tiene el objetivo de facilitar el acceso a capital.\n\nEl pasado 8 de junio, Pig.gi fue la única representante mexicana por parte de la alianza de Google Entrepreneurs con el tech hub Centraal.\n\nAdiós “caza-wifis”\n\nEn el último año, el número de megabytes (MB) navegados en internet móvil en México aumentó 69.3% para llegar a los 528 MB consumidos, de acuerdo con la Competitive Intelligence Unit (CIU).\n\n\n\nSin embargo, dice Joel, la conectividad móvil no es alcanzable para muchos mexicanos, por lo que se convierten en 'caza-wifis' para conservar su saldo.\n\n“El problema es que la conectividad móvil es cara. El 40% con menos recursos en México gasta 17% de su ingreso en conectividad. Mientras que el 20% con más recursos, sólo gasta el 2%”, ahonda el emprendedor.\n\nNo obstante, pese al costo, el mercado de telecomunicaciones móviles sigue creciendo en el país. Al primer trimestre del 2017 existen 112.4 millones de líneas, 3.2% más que el año anterior, según datos de CIU.\n\n\n\nLa brecha también representa un problema para que las marcas se comuniquen con sus consumidores porque no están siempre conectados. Fue ahí donde encontraron la oportunidad de negocio los emprendedores originarios de Colorado, Estados Unidos.\n\n“Las marcas buscan aumentar su alcance y llegar a jóvenes (que son mobile-first y mobile-only), pero muchos anuncios en apps son molestos y no ofrecen ningún valor al usuario final”, comparte Isaac.\n\nCon Pig.gi las personas se mantienen informadas y conectadas, además, en la app se pueden encontrar noticias, artículos, promociones y descuentos, presumen los startuperos. Sus clientes en México son principalmente de consumo masivo, como Coca-Cola, Amazon.com.mx y los bancos más grandes y, en Colombia, SCA y Dish, entre otros.\n\n\n\nLos hermanos Phillips cobran a las marcas por CPM (Costo por millar) y CPA (Costo por acción), modelos que las marcas ya conocen. La diferencia, aclara Isaac, es que “nosotros pasamos la mayoría del valor a nuestros usuarios en forma de recargas y otras recompensas como boletos de cine, tarjetas de Netflix y más”.\n\nModelo escalable\n\nJoel e Isaac conocen su mercado y han sabido complementar su know-how. Antes de dedicarse a Pig.gi, Joel estudió economía en Columbia University e Isaac estudió finanzas y trabajó para compañías de telecomunicaciones en México y en Hong Kong, China.\n\n\n\nAmbos crearon esta startup con la convicción de que el internet mejora las vidas. En un año han logrado más de 850,000 descargas en México y Colombia.\n\nTe puede interesar: Rappi, la startup latina que enamoró a los grandes de Silicon Valley\n\nY es que, en México, el 82.6% (92.9 millones) de líneas móviles corresponden a prepago, indica la CIU. Una realidad que se replica en el resto de América Latina, pues según las estimaciones de los emprendedores, “el 80% de los teléfonos en América Latina son de prepago y requieren saldo de tiempo aire para conectar, entonces el mercado es enorme”.\n\n\n\nEn 2016, los hermanos participaron en The Bridge by Coca Cola, una aceleradora comercial patrocinada por The Coca Cola Company, FEMSA, y Arca Continental. Eso impulsó su camino como emprendedores.\n\n\n\nEn su primer año, Pig.gi ha levantado más de un millón de dólares de grupos de capital privado e inversionistas ángeles de México, Colombia, y Estados Unidos.\n\n\n\nEl futuro se vislumbra prometedor, pues con la finalidad de brindar un mejor servicio a las marcas y conectarlas con sus consumidores en el momento correcto, con el mensaje adecuado, los hermanos están invirtiendo en big data.\n\n\n\nRecientemente firmaron un acuerdo comercial con Cambridge Analytica, una de las compañías más reconocidas de big data en el mundo que segmenta a los públicos por datos psicográficos, los cuales identifican los comportamientos de compra más allá de las características demográficas.\n\n\n\nPronto, los hermanos Phillips quieren llevar Pig.gi a más países para continuar con su labor de conectar a miles de personas a internet.",

    "article_text": "Cambridge Analytica in Latin America: What We Know So far\n\nCambridge Analytica worked on U.S. President Donald Trump's election campaign, and gained access to data on 50 million Facebook users in order to build voter profiles – including in Latin American countries holding elections.\n\n1. Brazil\n\nCambridge Analytica Chief Data Officer Dr Alex Tayler and Managing Director Mark Turnbull told an undercover Channel 4 journalist that the company has been working in Mexico and was now targeting Brazil, among other countries.\n\n\"If you're collecting data on people and you're profiling them, that gives you more insight that you can use to know how to segment the population, give them messaging about issues they care about, and language and imagery they're likely to engage with,\" Tayler said.\n\n\"We use that in America and we use that in Africa, that's what we do as a company. We've done it in Mexico, we've done it in Malaysia, and now we're moving to Brazil… Australia, China.\"\n\nBrazilian prosecutors on Wednesday opened an investigation into whether the London-based political consultancy acted illegally in Brazil, as controversy over the firm's data harvesting practices spread across the globe.\n\nThe firm is suspected of having illegally used the data of millions of Brazilians to create psychographic profiles through its partnership with Sao Paulo-based consulting group A Ponte Estratégia Planejamento e Pesquisa LTDA.\n\nPonte Estrategia allegedly asked to suspend the partnership with Cambridge Analytica, according to Bloomberg Business.\n\nBrazil is Facebook's third-largest market, and Brazilians will be holding a major election in less than seven months.\n\n2. Mexico and Colombia\n\nAs mentioned in the video above, the firm acknowledged having operated in Mexico, while Bloomberg Business shed light on PR material showing how it sealed a partnership with a phone application named Pig.gi and designed to provide free internet and phone credit in exchange for watching advertisements and reading sponsored stories.\n\n\"Pig.gi has already been hugely successful in Mexico and Colombia,\" said CEO Alexander Nix last year in a communique, when the app recorded 200,000 users. \"We're thrilled to be partnering with the app so that their partners can get the right message to the right people at the right time.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica's vice president told Bloomberg last year that the partnership was transparently designed to influence the votes of younger Mexicans — as Mexico's general election is due on July 1.\n\nBuzzFeed Mexico also reported that another Cambridge executive started last year to hire data analysts in nine states in Mexico, presenting the job post on LinkedIn as \"the brain behind the Mexican elections.\"\n\nIn an Oct. 23 Facebook post to the page 'Foreigners in Mexico City,' ahead of governor elections, executives of Cambridge's Mexican branch such as Arielle Dale Karro were also reportedly in contact with members of the PAN conservative party, including Senator Ernesto Cordero.\n\nCambridge's webpage also mentions Colombia as one of its major operations centers, quoting Bogota Mayor Enrique Peñalosa (Green Party) as one of its advisors. The mayor's office denied any links with the company.\n\nColombian daily El Tiempo found that Peñalosa worked with Farrow Colombia S. A. S. in July 2017, a company linked with the app Pig.gi — which records 150,000 users in the country, aiming to reach 800,000 by 2018.\n\nColombian voters are bound for the polls on May 27 to elect a new president, about two months after the parliamentary elections held early March, with the victory of center-right and far-right parties.\n\n3. Peru, Argentina and Guyana\n\nAccording to a map published on Cambridge's website, the company has also operated in Guyana, Peru and Argentina, although little information is available about the extent of the operations.\n\nIn Argentina, authorities are not waiting for an official request, and the National Electoral Chamber of the judicial branch has opened an investigation into Cambridge Analytica's work in the country.\n\nThe issue is not only data collecting: Channel 4 confirmed participation in the Kenyan elections of 2013 and 2017, running incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta's campaign through the use of incendiary messages and false news: Cambridge ran \"every element of his campaign.\"\n\nHe also discloses links to former MI6 agents and Israeli intelligence companies who provide Cambridge Analytica's clients with a report on \"all the skeletons\" in their opponents' closets.",

Here's what we know about it.\n\nEurope\n\nAs part of the Channel 4 investigation, executives said Cambridge Analytica and its parent company Strategic Communications Laboratories (SCL) had worked in more than 200 elections across the world, including in the Czech Republic.\n\n\"We've just used a different organisation to run a very, very successful project in an Eastern European country where... no-one even knew they were there,\" company executive Mark Turnbull said.\n\nCambridge Analytica's website also says it was involved in political campaigning in Italy in 2012, on behalf of a \"resurgent political party last successful in the 1980s\".\n\n\"CA's suggested reforms allowed the party to perform beyond its initial expectations at a time of turbulence in Italian politics,\" it says.\n\nBut the role of SCL goes back much further. It claims to have helped the Orange Revolution in 2004 in Ukraine which helped bring the pro-Western President Viktor Yushchenko to power.\n\n\"SCL succeeded in maintaining the cohesion of the coalition to ensure a hard-fought victory,\" an old post on the SCL website reads.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption SCL says it was hired to \"erode and weaken\" anti-government opposition in Donetsk\n\nMore recently, SCL says it was hired by the Ukrainian government to provide \"localised communications campaigns\" to help them win back control of Donetsk during the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\n\n\"The final project report was delivered to the President of Ukraine...this report was pivotal in later national decisions,\" the company says.\n\nKenya\n\nCambridge Analytica was used twice to help secure victory for Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta - first in 2013, then again in 2017.\n\nOfficially, the company's website boasts of doing in-depth research to uncover the issues driving voters in the country.\n\nBut Mr Turnbull told Channel 4 their input actually went much further.\n\n\"We have rebranded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging. I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing - so just about every element of this candidate,\" he said.\n\nMr Kenyatta's Jubilee Party has downplayed the impact of the group, saying it employed the company's parent company, SCL, to help with branding.\n\nBut the country's main opposition coalition - the National Super Alliance (Nasa) - has called for a full investigation to be carried out.\n\n\"This was a criminal enterprise which clearly wanted to subvert the will of the people - through manipulation, through propaganda,\" official Norman Magaya told the BBC.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The firm says it controlled \"every element\" of President Kenyatta's election victory last year\n\nNigeria\n\nReports suggest that the data analysis firm also played a controversial role in Nigeria's 2015 presidential election.\n\nThe UK's Guardian newspaper says that Cambridge Analytica was hired by a Nigerian billionaire who was \"panicking at the idea of a change of government\" to work on then-president Goodluck Jonathan's re-election campaign.\n\nThe newspaper said sources familiar with the campaign described how the company was looking to collect \"kompromat\" - compromising material or information - on opposition leader Muhammadu Buhari.\n\nImage copyright Red Media Africa Image caption Goodluck Jonathan congratulated Muhammadu Buhari (pictured) on his win\n\nWitnesses told the paper that Cambridge Analytica was then offered material from Israeli computer hackers amid election campaigns in Nigeria and St Kitts and Nevis.\n\nThe hackers had reportedly gained access to the private emails of two politicians who are now heads of state.\n\n\"Cambridge Analytica was paid an estimated £2m to orchestrate a ferocious campaign against [Mr Buhari],\" the Guardian reported.\n\nMr Buhari went on to win the presidential race and there is no suggestion that Mr Jonathan was aware of any alleged wrongdoing.\n\nSCL Elections, Cambridge Analytica's parent company, has denied receiving or using hacked or stolen information.\n\nMexico\n\nIn July 2017, Cambridge Analytica revealed that it had teamed up with a phone app in Mexico and Colombia called Pig.gi, which gives users free service in exchange for watching adverts and taking surveys.\n\nThe firm was hoping to use data mined from Pig.gi to help a candidate in Mexico's July 2018 presidential election, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\"There's a huge opportunity in this country to find the issues that are important for people and actually turn people out to vote,\" Cambridge Analytica's vice-president of business development, Brittany Kaiser, said.\n\nSeparately, it was reported in October that the head of operations for Cambridge Analytica in Mexico, Arielle Dale Karro, had posted an advertisement on a Facebook page for foreigners living in the country.\n\nThe post sought people \"with significant political experience\" who were interested in becoming a campaign manager in one of eight Mexican states, Buzzfeed reported.\n\nCambridge Analytica later denied that Ms Karro was carrying out any political work for the firm. Mr Nix also stated that \"Cambridge Analytica is not working for any political party in Mexico\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie says the firm planted fake news\n\nBrazil\n\nCambridge Analytica was reportedly \"prospecting for clients in Brazil's presidential race\" that is due to take place later this year.\n\nCA Ponte, a partnership between Cambridge Analytica and Brazilian consultancy firm Ponte Estrategia, \"had been in touch with representatives of three potential candidates\", according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe partnership's director André Torretta told the El Pais newspaper [in Portuguese] that he had been approached by two presidential campaigns but had not reached a deal with either.\n\nIndia\n\nCambridge Analytica is part of the India branch of the SCL group which offers \"political campaign management\" among its services.\n\nIt lists India's two main political parties - the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress - among its clients.\n\nHimanshu Sharma, the firm's vice president says on his publicly available LinkedIn profile that the company has \"successfully managed four election campaigns for the BJP\".\n\nHe names among them the 2014 general election which swept Prime Minister Narendra Modi to power.\n\nHowever both parties have denied any links with the company.\n\nThe head of the BJP's social media unit Amit Malviya told the BBC that the party had \"not heard of SCL Group... so there is no question of us working with them\".\n\nAnd the Congress party said it had never used SCL or any of its affiliate companies as it has its own data analytical team.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mr Nix spoke to BBC Newsnight before the Channel 4 report was aired on Monday night. He declined to be interviewed after the undercover footage was broadcast\n\nMalaysia\n\nIn the Channel 4 investigation, Malaysia was named as one of the countries in which Cambridge Analytica had operated, sparking a huge national debate ahead of a general election.\n\nThe company's website reportedly stated that it supported Prime Minister Najib Razak's Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition during generation election campaigning in Kedah state in 2013 \"with a targeted messaging campaign highlighting their school improvements\".\n\nMr Najib and the BN strongly denied having used the company. They said its advice was \"provided personally\" to Mukhriz Mahathir - he was at that time part of BN and went on to be Kedah's chief minister.\n\nMr Mukhriz, in turn, denied this, but his former media manager has contradicted his denial.\n\nMr Mukhriz, now with the opposition, will be running against Mr Najib for prime minister in the coming elections.",

    "article_text": "Aeroméxico, Grupo Vasconia y Femsa han recibido críticas en las redes sociales por publicar videos y cartas que invitan a sus empleados a votar contra Andrés Manuel López Obrador.\n\nCIUDAD DE MÉXICO (Expansión) -\n\n“Recientemente, hemos escuchado con preocupación propuestas de estatización de empresas, la derogación de las reformas energética y educativa, entre otras ideas que significarían un retroceso de décadas y el regreso a un modelo económico que está más probado que no ha funcionado en varios países. Venezuela, Argentina, Cuba, Unión Soviética entre otros son testigos de ello”.\n\nEstas son algunas de las palabras que Germán Larrea, presidente del Consejo de Administración de Grupo México, le expresó a sus trabajadores, proveedores y accionistas este martes en una carta que citó Notimex.\n\nEl quinto hombre más rico de México, de acuerdo con el ranking de Expansión, pidió realizar un voto \"razonado y útil\" para las próximas elecciones del primero de julio, a fin de evitar votar por un gobierno \"populista\".\n\nEste llamado se suma a la lista de empresas —como Aeroméxico, Grupo Coppel, FEMSA, Telmex o Herdez— que han decidido compartir su postura política a través de videos o comunicados a sus empleados y a los ciudadanos en general. De acuerdo con varios especialistas esto no afectaría en gran medida sus ventas, pero sí la imagen de sus marcas.\n\nLee: Herdez, Vasconia, Femsa y Grupo México advierten por el populismo\n\nSin embargo estas publicaciones que han surgido en los últimos dos meses han ocasionado un descontento entre los usuarios de Twitter, quienes se muestran, en general, en contra de la postura de estos empresarios, y que en algunos casos llamaron a \"boicotear\" a estas compañías.\n\n“A mi no me parece mal que el director general o el presidente de una empresa exprese a sus empleados su punto de vista sobre un proceso como el que se está viviendo. Me parece absolutamente legítimo lo que están haciendo, que es hablar de un voto pensado y reflexionado, no de un voto de enojo”, comenta Oscar Kauffman, director general de Nicestream.\n\nEl especialista asegura que este tipo de manifestaciones a través de las redes sociales en contra de las empresas es alarmante, ya que de no ganar el candidato a la presidencia Andrés Manuel López Obrador, al que los empresarios hacen referencia de manera indirecta, están invitando a sus simpatizantes a que ejerzan “toda su furia” contra ellas.\n\n“¿Qué tanto va incidir en que la gente deje de comprar Herdez o Vasconia? No lo sé, evidentemente va haber gente enojada, me queda claro, pero eso no quiere decir que el negocio se va a acabar”, agrega Kaufmann.\n\n¿Es ilegal presionar a tus trabajadores?\n\nPor otro lado, otros expertos señalan que esta postura “paternalista” de las compañías mexicanas no es buena para sus marcas y sus servicios, ya que los mezclan con una ideología política y tienen el riesgo de afectar a su imagen, de acuerdo con Isabel Blasco, directora de la consultora Interbrand en México.\n\nEn redes sociales circulan comentarios por parte de los usuarios que enfatizan que dejarán de comprar productos de Herdez –dueño de los helados Nutrisa, Airea de Campo y Del Fuerte—, porque señalan que las compañías supuestamente “obligan” a sus empleados a inclinarse por un partido político, mientras que otros usuarios acusan de \"corruptos\" a los líderes empresariales como Grupo Vasconia y Grupo México.\n\nDe acuerdo con el artículo 7 de la Ley General en Materia de Delitos Electorales, cuando el dueño o directivo de una empresa presiona a sus empleados o subordinados a votar por un determinado partido político, o incluso lo condiciona a que participe en actos políticos, está cometiendo un delito.\n\nLee: México vive un dèjá vu: empresarios vs AMLO\n\n“En nuestro país estábamos muy acostumbrado a que las compañías siempre estuvieran alineadas al estatus quo, a los partidos oficiales o a los partidos que estuvieran en turno, que por muchos años fue el PRI, que tenía una influencia importante sobre los medios, sobre las compañías, etc. Pero ahora, por primera vez estamos viendo qué empresas están apoyando a los candidatos que no son los oficiales o los que están en el poder, y no solamente a nivel federal, sino estatal y municipal”, señaló Rafael Garante, director general de Percepción e Imagen.\n\nAl respecto, el candidato López Obrador solicitó este martes a Germán Larrea a que no asuste a la gente con las ideas plasmadas en la misiva.\n\nRecomendamos: Coppel, Aeroméxico y Coparmex rechazan señalamientos de AMLO sobre apoyo a Anaya\n\n“En este caso sí hay mucho en juego, para los empresarios lo más importante es su compañía y es seguir generando negocio, generando empleos y seguir creciendo en su mercado. Hoy, esas posiciones no buscan más que eso, hacer consciencia entre sus empleados o entre sus consumidores sobre la posición que tienen ellos referente a esa tranquilidad corporativa o económica que les podría traer tal o cual candidato”, agrega Garante.\n\nEl especialista asegura que las empresas han evaluado qué tanto pueden afectarle un cambio de gobierno, y esto ha generado una incertidumbre en los mercados que los ha orillado a expresar su posición política.\n\nNoticias del día Dos envíos de lunes a viernes con las noticias más importantes. Suscríbete\n\nPor ejemplo, Daniel Servitje, director general de Grupo Bimbo, dijo a finales de abril que la compañía será cautelosa con sus planes de inversión en el primer semestre del año, ante la incertidumbre del proceso electoral.\n\n\"Estamos revisando y demorando parte de nuestras inversiones, estamos ajustando nuestros costos para prepararnos para un tiempo volátil en México\", añadió el empresario mexicano durante una conferencia con analistas.",

    "article_text": "A su juicio, la campaña territorial no se está cambiando por las redes sociales. No obstante reconoce que después que algo se establece en las redes sociales es muy difícil volver a minimizarlo, por lo cual los candidatos tienen que tener un ojo muy especial en las redes.\n\n—Diego Barcia es un uruguayo de 31 años que se desempeña como gerente comercial para Chile y Uruguay de Nicestream, empresa especializada en estrategia de comunicación digital. Barcia trabajó en la campaña electoral de Sebastián Piñera en Chile, haciendo el relevamiento de las redes sociales.\n\n—¿En qué consistió el trabajo que hicieron en Chile para la campaña de Sebastián Piñera?\n\n—Trabajamos directamente con los jefes de campaña de medios de Piñera. Nuestro rol era brindarles información privilegiada de cómo se comportaban las personas con respecto a determinados temas que empezaban a moverse tanto en Twitter y Facebook como en la prensa digital.\n\n—¿En qué temas?\n\n—Pasamos por un montón de temas, desde qué se decían de los políticos en la Teletón, hasta el monitoreo sobre los debates presidenciales o cómo impactaba el mundo del fútbol en la política. Todo lo que podía afectar el humor de la gente, como un cambio de tarifas o el precio de un servicio público. Y obviamente, qué decía el resto de los candidatos, los movimientos políticos dentro de los partidos principales, tanto de la derecha como de la izquierda.\n\n—¿Cómo era el proceso que seguían para hacer esas mediciones?\n\n—Nosotros tenemos dos focos de monitoreo. Uno es la prensa tradicional. Más allá de todo el potencial que tienen las redes sociales, hay dos cosas que disparan una noticia: una es el periodismo tradicional y otra es la propia gente o hechos que los políticos hacen populares queriendo o sin querer. Twitter y Facebook levantan temas de la gente, y por eso monitoreamos esas redes. Pero fundamentalmente monitoreamos la prensa tradicional que aterriza en las redes sociales. Por ejemplo, todo lo que publica El País en su edición papel lo vuelca en la digital y sus redes. Midiendo la prensa digital nosotros tenemos más o menos el 95% de lo que son las noticias de El País. Primero hacemos un análisis de la conversación que disparan esos dos focos, y posteriormente hacemos un análisis del ADN de las personas que son participantes de esa conversación.\n\n—¿Qué se busca determinar con ese análisis?\n\n—Son dos cosas diferentes de entender. Por un lado sé qué se está diciendo y qué se está hablando, y por otro lado quiénes están hablando. Por ejemplo, en esta campaña tuvimos dos hitos que afectaban al candidato o a los candidatos con el mismo volumen de visibilidad, la misma tasa de viralización, pero en donde uno de los temas era totalmente politizado y el ADN de esas personas era totalmente politizado, y ahí descubríamos que estábamos mirando a un conjunto de personas de los núcleos duros de los candidatos, que ya tiene su voto asignado y que no van a cambiar de parecer. Y por otro, una conversación con el mismo volumen de la que estábamos hablando anteriormente, pero con un montón de perfiles que eran de doña María, que realmente está hablando del tema con preocupación y sin tener un sesgo político.\n\n—¿Cuál es el grupo más importante para las mediciones que hacen, el núcleo duro del candidato o el de doña María?\n\n—Hace poco participé de un programa junto con un consultor político uruguayo, y él ponía el ejemplo de las corrientes marítimas. Hay corrientes muy profundas que son los valores políticos; hay corrientes medias, que son las características innatas del candidato; y después está el mundo de lo superfluo, del día a día, y eso es lo que más o menos atiende las redes sociales. ¿A qué voy con esto? Hay un pequeño porcentaje de las personas que no tiene un parecer político fundamentado, argumentado y decidido, pero su voto vale uno también. Entonces nosotros atendemos con mucho más importancia a aquellas personas que no tienen un parecer político bien definido, que por lo general son indecisos, carecen de ideología definida o determinada, y que se deciden en su voto por una idea del candidato, por una forma de ser del candidato, o una identificación con la figura del candidato en general. Por lo cual la más importante para nosotros es la conversación donde está doña María hablando de su preocupación, y no tanto la conversación de fondo ideológico sobre determinado tema.\n\n—¿Las redes sociales están cambiando la forma de encarar las campañas electorales en el mundo?\n\n—Si la pregunta es si están cambiando un acto público en donde el candidato demuestra su fuerza en cantidad de gente, no. Siempre las redes sociales van a necesitar la foto del candidato con un montón de personas enfrente, porque eso valida la información. La campaña territorial, y espero por el bien de la democracia que se mantenga así, no se está cambiando por las redes sociales. ¿Sabés cuál es el cambio más importante? Primero que nada en la percepción del candidato y de la campaña. Es decir, uno tiene la posibilidad de mostrar o súpermostrar o sobrevalorar lo que está haciendo. Después que algo se establece en redes sociales es muy difícil volver a minimizarlo, por lo cual los candidatos tienen que tener un ojo particular en las redes sociales. La otra cosa que va a cambiar, y esto sí me parece bueno, es la forma de publicitar. Nosotros estamos acostumbrados en Uruguay a que en el tiempo de elecciones se tapicen las ciudades de carteles. Ayuda a la democracia que todos los políticos tengan las mismas relativas chances y que no dependa tanto de cuán rico es el candidato para llevar mejor el mensaje. Debería de juzgarse por los planes y las ideas y no tanto por la cantidad de publicidad en la que está dispuesto a invertir.\n\n—En Chile se dio un fenómeno que se viene repitiendo en las elecciones en casi todo el mundo, que es cómo le están errando las encuestas de intención de voto. ¿Las mediciones que ustedes hacen con las redes sociales, pueden sustituir a las encuestas?\n\n—Mi respuesta es sí, pero con dos salvedades. Una, me parece que las encuestas de estudio profundo, estadístico, se hacen por profesionales calificados y con información validada, y por más que le erren tienen que seguir existiendo. Ahora, creo que ninguna de las empresas consultoras que hacen encuestas políticas deben prescindir de estos canales, que son sumamente baratos, son mucho más masivos y que si eligen la información con suficiente inteligencia como para no tomar la basura que también tienen las redes sociales, estamos hablando que uno en unos minutos puede hacer una consulta de miles y miles de personas, con lo cual el riesgo de errarle se reduce un montón. Hay muchos ejemplos en esta campaña en Chile en donde algunas consultas en las redes sociales daban resultados mucho más acertados que lo que dieron las encuestas con métodos tradicionales.",

Según datos de la Comisión Honoraria de Lucha Contra el Cáncer (CHLCC), una de cada 10 uruguayas se ven afectadas, cinco son diagnosticadas por día y dos mueren a diario.\n\nEn el Mes Rosa, Alcance fomentó el desarrollo una comunidad en medios digitales con el fin de acompañar, informar y concientizar sobre la importancia de prevenir el cáncer de mama. Andrea Russo, gerente general de la institución, señaló: “Cuando evaluamos los resultados de la campaña digital de 2016, percibimos la necesidad de generar un marco para poder reunir toda la información y servir como espacio de diálogo e intercambio. Al cierre de la campaña 2017 podemos decir que estamos orgullosos porque fue un objetivo logrado”.\n\nNicestream indicó que la conversación en medios digitales en Uruguay durante octubre se concentró a grandes rasgos en generar concientización y divulgar formas de prevención de esta enfermedad, que afecta en su mayoría a las mujeres. Asimismo, confirmó que entre las acciones digitales más destacadas del mes, llevadas a cabo por empresas u organizaciones, se posicionó con el 58% en primer lugar la de Alcance con el hashtag #PrevenirEsCuidarte. En tanto, la siguiente marca que ocupó el segundo lugar registró un 18% de contenido generado.\n\nAlcance logró propiciar el espacio para que se generara una comunidad virtual -de forma orgánica- de la cual los usuarios se mostraron dispuestos a formar parte e interactuar, contando sus experiencias y dando palabras de apoyo y contención.\n\nDurante octubre, en comparación con el mismo mes de 2016, se generó un 11% más de interacciones en la Fan Page de Alcance -sin contar las reproducciones del video explicativo-. “Este es un dato muy relevante, ya que, con una inversión menor a la del año pasado, la publicación del video fue la de mayor alcance en las redes sociales de la institución, llegando a más de 94.600 personas y 146.867 reproducciones en Facebook y alcanzando las 2.637 impresiones en Twitter”, explicó Diego Barcia, Country Manager de Nicestream Uruguay.\n\nAlcance, cuya fuerza laboral está integrada en un 93% por mujeres, promueve la lucha contra el cáncer de mama desde hace años. Este 2017, la campaña -bajo el hashtag #PrevenirEsCuidarte-incluyó un video que promueve el examen de autoconocimiento de mamas (video que contó con el apoyo de la CHLCC) y la Trivia Rosa para desafiar a los participantes a través de una serie de preguntas a ver qué tan informados están sobre el tema para luego brindarles información.\n\nEn tanto, para sus colaboradores, Alcance organizó charlas informativas y preventivas a cargo del equipo técnicode la institución y la coordinación de mamografías en el mamógrafo móvil de la CHCLCC ubicado en Tres Cruces. También intervino la fachada de su Casa Central, ubicada en Bvar. España, con luces rosa y un lazo alusivo a la lucha contra el cáncer de mama.\n\nComo desde hace más de 20 años, Alcance trabaja pensando en el bienestar de la familia a través de tres vectores: mejorar la calidad de vida de sus colaboradores y socios, el medio ambiente y la comunidad en su conjunto. En esta oportunidad, centró sus esfuerzos en ser un sostén y promotor de cuidado y prevención en el Mes de la Lucha Contra el Cáncer de Mama.",

Martí, la compañía que opera clubes y comercializa artículos deportivos, ‘quemó’ los dos en las últimas horas, asegura Oscar Kaufmann, director general de Nicestream México, agencia de comunicación digital.\n\nAyer martes, el director de cine Manolo Caro denunció en su cuenta de Twitter que el gerente de un establecimiento de la cadena ubicado en el centro comercial Eureka en San Antonio (Ciudad de México) le impidió grabar una escena de su próxima serie para Netflix, ‘La casa de las flores’, que incluía un beso entre dos personas del mismo sexo. La respuesta en redes en apoyo al cineasta y las críticas hacia Martí no se hicieron esperar.\n\n“Quedó al descubierto que la empresa no tiene los mecanismos para hacer contención a una crisis ocasionada por un empleado que tiene una personalidad contraria a la de la marca”, aseguró Kaufmann.\n\nLa tienda @DeportesMarti dice que las parejas gay es una mala imagen para su marca y les resulta “peyorativo” para la empresa. RT — Manolo Caro (@ManoloCaroS) 10 de octubre de 2017\n\nPara el experto en comunicación digital invertir en un individuo que gestiona de forma contraria a la que se promueve la empresa que representa tiene graves consecuencias. En este caso, los internautas y seguidores del productor de cine mostraron su inconformidad y emitieron mensajes hostiles hacia Martí.\n\nLee más:¿Qué hacer para no 'cruzazulearla' en redes sociales?\n\n“Qué bueno que lo compartes. Si no va con la imagen de la marca pues yo no compraré más en esa tienda”, se puede leer en los comentarios publicados en el tuit de Manolo Caro.\n\nLa solución de Martí\n\nCuatro horas después de la denuncia en redes sociales, la compañía deportiva difundió un mensaje en sus cuentas oficiales de Facebook y Twitter, en el que se disculpa por el comportamiento del empleado, asegurando que su actuación no representa las políticas de la empresa.\n\nY a pesar de que ésta invitó al productor a regresar a filmar a la tienda, Caro se negó en otro mensaje de Twitter.\n\nPara Rafael Garate, director general de Percepción e Imagen, agencia de relaciones públicas, comunicación estratégica y digital, la emisión de un comunicado no es mala idea para tratar de resarcir el incidente. El problema, asevera, es la poca velocidad de reacción que demostró la empresa y la forma en que respondió.\n\n“Publicar una respuesta a la reacción social no tiene el mismo peso que difundir información inmediatamente después de lo sucedido. Esto lo único que provoca es que la gente especule y los involucrados no queden satisfechos con las disculpas recibidas”, explica Gárate.\n\nLee más: Crisis en redes sociales, el dolor de cabeza de las empresas en América Latina\n\nAdemás de que le da oportunidad a la competencia de saltar a la luz y ganarse unos cuentos seguidores. Es lo que hizo Innovasport, empresa de artículos deportivos que aprovechó la ocasión para ofrecer sus tiendas como locación para la serie de Netflix.\n\n“Si siguen ocupando un lugar para filmar (y mejor) nuestras tiendas están abiertas. La que quieran. DM”, publicaron en Twitter.\n\n¿Qué debe hacer la empresa?\n\n“Si hablas de algo tienes que exhibir en tus acciones que realmente eres congruente con lo que piensas o dices”, afirma el director general de Nicestream México, quien le recomienda a la marca capacitar a su talento para que actúen como embajadores coherentes, responsables y que demuestren su preocupación con cuidar la imagen de su empleador.\n\nEl gerente tomó la decisión de impedir las grabaciones sin la autorización de un supervisor, por lo que la apuesta debe ser por la capacitación y la transferencia de valores organizacionales, señala Rafael Gárate.\n\n“Esto es una labor constante e inicia desde el proceso de reclutamiento. La empresa tiene que seleccionar perfiles acorde a su cultura, no se trata solo de capacitarlos, sino que desde el principio el individuo tenga empatía con la compañía”, complementa José Ramón Barreiro, director de la Facultad de Negocios de la Universidad La Salle.\n\nPor ahora, coinciden los expertos consultados, los ejecutivos de Martí deben concretar un acercamiento personal con Manolo Caro y su equipo de producción para tratar de solucionar el inconveniente.\n\nPara conocer la postura y las acciones que tomará la empresa que comercializa artículos deportivos, Expansión se comunicó con su agencia de relaciones públicas, la cual dijo -en un comunicado de prensa- que la compañía estableció contacto con el equipo de producción del cineasta para ofrecerle una disculpa, rectificar y fijar una postura ante los hechos.\n\nNoticias del día Dos envíos de lunes a viernes con las noticias más importantes. Suscríbete\n\n\"A raíz de esta conversación, se acordó transformar este suceso en una acción positiva que permita promover un mensaje de respeto e inclusión entre las audiencias internas y externas de Deportes Martí (...) En los próximos días, ambos equipos nos reuniremos para afinar detalles y desarrollar conjuntamente una serie de acciones basados en el valor de la diversidad para impactar a todos nuestros colaboradores, clientes y visitantes\", se lee en el documento.\n\nNota del editor. Este artículo fue modificado debido a que la agencia de relaciones públicas de Martí compartió información sobre el incidente ocurrido con el cineasta Manolo Caro.",

    "article_text": "Todos hablan de ellos, sí, pero muy pocos saben qué son y cómo se relacionan. Hay especialistas que manejan “granjas” de cuentas automatizadas. Logramos hablar con ellos, analizamos millones de tuits y te explicamos cómo funciona esta “realidad paralela”.\n\nCuando el presidente de la Nación, Mauricio Macri, presentó su nueva plataforma de Gobierno el 30 de octubre último más de 15 mil cuentas participaron de la conversación en Twitter. En total generaron más de 90 mil mensajes y 10 mil retuits. Pero al menos el 3% de esas cuentas -casi 600 supuestas “personas”- se comportó como un “bot” haciendo casi el 10% de los tuits totales. Y esos números están lejos de ser una excepción. Si revisamos la red durante el anuncio de la recuperación de la #Nieta125 los porcentajes de cuentas con características automatizadas son similares: 4,5%.\n\nEn el debate porteño, que organizó el canal TN el 11 de octubre último, también quedó claro, cómo se ve en las menciones de “Carrió” más adelante, que existen dos polos en la red de Twitter Argentina: uno filomacrista y otro filokirchnerista que concentran gran parte de los mensajes. Ambos tienen cuentas con mensajes extremistas que ayudan aún más a la polarización. El odio, como veremos más adelante, se tornó el combustible de esta red.\n\nBots, trolls, fakes, influencers y “call center”. Todos estos términos que los políticos y los usuarios se tiran por la cabeza parecen intercambiables en el debate, pero no lo son. Son bien diferentes. Desde la campaña que llevó al ex presidente de los Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, a la Casa Blanca en 2008 las redes sociales forman parte de la estrategia que lleva a un candidato a ganar elecciones. Estos diez años también vieron nacer, o reverdecer, estos conceptos.\n\n¿Cómo? Instagram y Facebook son hoy los mejores canales por cantidad de usuarios, mientras que Twitter parece ceder terreno. Pero eso no quita que, a la hora de facturar, sea posible comprar 1000 cuentas piratas en la red del pajarito por apenas 3 dólares. ¿O habría que cotizar en rublos? ¿Cuánto vale e importa ser “tendencia” en una red social por unas horas? ¿Importa realmente, si ser “tendencia” se basa en un castillo de naipes construidos por “bots”?\n\nAntes de avanzar aclaremos el diccionario. Como veremos más adelante muchas veces estos términos no son excluyentes. Por ejemplo, un troll puede ser una persona o un bot y una cuenta puede ser creada por un humano, pero luego tener la mitad de su contenido creado por un bot. Pero de qué hablamos cuando hablamos de cada uno de estos conceptos:\n\n¿Qué es un bot? Una cuenta en una red social (en general, Twitter) cuya generación de contenido es automatizada. Cuando actúan en conjunto se le suele decir granja de bots. Rara vez son influyentes, pero sí ayudan a generar trending topics -los temas que Twitter considera “calientes” en cierto momento y destaca en su plataforma- o generan “ruido” acerca de un tema.\n\n¿Qué es un troll? Alguien enfocado en acosar, criticar o antagonizar de manera provocadora y despectiva. La palabra originalmente refiere a desagradables personajes folclóricos que viven en las cavernas escandinavas. El paralelismo con el troll online se da por su supuesta antisociabilidad. Los mensajes negativos son los que más reacciones generan en Twitter (aunque estos perfiles son claves también en foros y comentarios de medios online), por este motivo los trolls sí logran el cometido de influir, pero como veremos más adelante lo hacen entre los “convencidos”. Por la forma en la que agreden es difícil encontrar, por ahora, bots que sean trolls efectivos. Según un paper canadiense de 2014 que analiza el sadismo online, el 5,6% de los usuarios reconocía disfrutar “trollear”.\n\n¿Qué es un fake? Son cuentas que se hacen pasar por otra persona, en general alguien reconocido con el fin de generarle seguidores que creen estar siguiendo a la persona real. Esto se hace por entretenimiento, para molestar o para luego poder vender la cuenta a un tercero que le cambia el nombre y se queda con miles de seguidores. Hay especialistas que consideran “fake” también a las cuentas anónimas.\n\n¿Qué son los influencers (pagos o no)? Estas cuentas generan un impacto mucho mayor que las normales, son multiplicadores que ganaron relevancia llevando su prestigio del mundo offline (tv, radio, diarios, deporte, arte, etcétera) al online o directamente se trata de nuevos referentes nacidos en el ya no tan nuevo mundo online (youtubers, bloggers, tuiteros, entre otros). Muchas, sin aclararlo, publicitan a cambio de dinero productos de consumo masivo y, a veces, hacen lo propio con políticos.\n\nUno de los problemas a la hora de poner la lupa sobre esto es la informalidad en la que se maneja y lo poco tajante que son las definiciones. Para esta investigación, Chequeado habló con varias personas con experiencia en generar granja de bots: todas se ampararon en el off the record y dejaron claro que su servicio, que puede cobrarse varios cientos de miles de pesos, no suele dejar huella fiscal. Suele ser facturado como “servicios de comunicación” o algo similar. Nadie quiere dejar por escrito que contrató a una empresa para criticar a su oponente o, simplemente, generar un trending topic que lo posicione como alguien con más poder del que tiene.\n\nOtra capa de complejidad se agrega a las ya nombradas: una persona real puede por momentos comportarse como un troll (criticando con saña a otra persona) aunque unos minutos antes haya compartido una amable foto suya con su mascota. A su vez, esta persona puede tener un bot conectado a su cuenta. Hay muchas opciones gratuitas o económicas para publicar cierto contenido, como el tiempo o los títulos de algún medio o blog.\n\nTras hacer el análisis previo sobre una cuenta, quizás se logra saber como veremos más adelante si es una cuenta automatizada o una persona real, pero comprobar si lo hace porque tiene “puesta la camiseta” de determinado partido o idea o porque recibe dinero es muy difícil. Hay casos en ambos polos y este medio también supo de varios casos en los que se atacaba en una interna a miembros del mismo partido.\n\nComo se verá más adelante hay dudas sobre la eficiencia de estas campañas fuera del relativamente pequeño círculo que “vive” en Twitter, pero esos cientos de miles de pesos son cambio chico en campañas donde un cartel en una autopista cuesta mucho más. El costo de hacerlo parece menor y, como dice el viejo adagio publicitario, “tiro a la basura la mitad del dinero que invierto en publicidad, el problema es que no sé qué mitad”.\n\nSi bien algunas de las consultoras en la Argentina que, según pudo averiguar Chequeado, generan estos servicios son Illuminati, Nicestream y Publiquest, en sus sitios se ve poco sobre el tema. Lo más cercano al trabajo de granja de bots que muestran es lo que se llama social seeding, algo así como siembra social, que significa ni más ni menos que “plantar” el contenido del cliente en la conversación orgánica que sucede en las redes. Este contenido “plantado” en línea de acuerdo con lo que quiere el cliente -político o corporativo- puede ser automatizado (bots) o hecho manualmente, vía influencers o staff de la agencia.\n\nChequeado pudo ver cómo se genera una granja de bots.\n\nChequeado pudo ver cómo se genera una granja de bots. Vale aclarar que este es uno de los métodos, hay otros en los que, por caso, para evitar que Twitter lo detecte, se hace que un bot navegue Twitter.com como si fuese una persona. Este que explicamos a continuación se basa en la interacción de miles de cuentas, varias planillas de cálculo y un par de administradores humanos:\n\n1- Se define la estrategia. ¿Será una campaña para atacar a alguien? ¿Se hará para hacer “ruido positivo” alrededor de un candidato? Dependiendo del tiempo con el que se cuenta, se plantea el paso a paso. El apuro en esto hace más obvio detectar quién mueve los hilos y puede llegar a ser sancionado por Twitter con el cierre de un gran conjunto de cuentas a la vez.\n\n2- Se compran las cuentas posibles que se quieren usar con valores que empiezan en US$ 3 por mil cuentas. Hay sitios en Rusia que venden estas cuentas. ¿Un ejemplo? BuyAccs.com. La cuenta relacionada con una dirección de mail de Gmail, menos “sospechosa” para Twitter, vale 100 veces más que la que usa una cuenta rusa.\n\n3- En la plataforma que utilizan varios clientes se define la estrategia y se “incuban” las cuentas. Esta incubación significa pasar de la cuenta anónima a darle un nombre de usuario, un nombre y apellido, foto, bio, ubicación y, lo más importante, una manera de tuitear que incluye retuitear contenido de terceros. Chequeado vio el detrás de escena de la interfaz del administrador de estas campañas y quedaba claro que a la vez trabajaban para empresas de consumo masivo y políticos de varios colores en distintos países del mundo.\n\n4- Esa “manera” de tuitear se define, por ejemplo, estableciendo que la cuenta “juanperez” tendrá un perfil deportivo e interesado en la política de cierto partido. Entonces la plataforma define que, por caso, retuiteará a ciertos deportistas y periodistas deportivos (que ya tienen predefinidos en una lista en un Excel ad hoc), tomará títulos de medios que cubran esos temas (también predefinidos) y le agregará antes o después una exclamación. En el medio de esos mensajes aparecerá el cliente real retuiteado o con un mensaje particular.\n\n5- Tras conectarse a Twitter, a través de una app específica para desarrolladores, esta plataforma puede manejar cientos o miles de cuentas desde una misma pantalla del navegador.\n\n6- Tras lanzarse la campaña, esta misma plataforma va brindando reportes sobre el éxito o no de la estrategia.\n\nVale aclarar que los bots suelen funcionar mejor en Twitter. Aunque Facebook tiene otros problemas, como la gran cantidad de páginas falsas comandadas, en este momento los bots no suelen ser uno de ellos, lo mismo sucede en Instagram, también propiedad de la firma fundada por Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nEugenia Mitchelstein, investigadora especializada en medios y redes sociales de la Universidad de San Andrés, dijo a este medio que Twitter hace la vista gorda por los inconvenientes que tiene para generar nuevos usuarios. Es que la red que se hizo famosa por sus 140 caracteres tiene problemas de crecimiento mientras sus competidores en Facebook no paran de aumentar la cantidad de nuevas cuentas. Por acción u omisión, Twitter no sube la barrera para que a los bots se le dificulte su tarea. En Estados Unidos, como destaca Vox, también se cree que parte de estos problemas que fueron reconocidos por su propio CEO en 2015 se basan en que la empresa creía que parte de su ADN, sobre todo después de su rol en la primavera árabe, era ser una plataforma con altísima libertad de expresión. Eso que parecía positivo hace unos años hoy se le volvió en contra.\n\nDificultar la tarea de los bots no es necesariamente complejo técnicamente, aunque frenarlos sí parece una tarea titánica, y de hecho Twitter lo hizo generándole un problema a las granjas de bots. Cuando la empresa decidió pedir verificación de cuenta por el celular, esto complicó la tarea de los que fabricaban cuentas al por mayor, que debieron buscar la manera de sortear el problema. Lo lograron, como prueba el precio de mil cuentas que mostramos más arriba, pero así y todo son muchos los que creen que la red del pajarito podría hacer mucho más.\n\nHubo momentos en los que el equipo de un candidato en la recta final de la campaña pidió que se intensificara el tuiteo de la granja de bots. Esto provocó que Twitter los detectara y bloqueara de un momento para otro a todos. Así la agencia debió acelerar el proceso para generar una nueva granja en horas. Son los gajes del oficio de estos titiriteros digitales que operan en las sombras\n\nEn la actualidad, Twitter es el foco de una gran cantidad de reclamos en los Estados Unidos por la existencia de bots y cuentas falsas que generan ruido alrededor de la figura de las dos personas que fueron candidatos en las elecciones de ese país, Donald Trump y Hillary Clinton, y que son acusados de ser impulsados por Rusia. A fines de septiembre último, la empresa de San Francisco reconoció que había encontrado más de 200 cuentas relacionadas con Rusia y en octubre encontró muchos más de 2000.\n\nEn ese contexto, la empresa le dijo a Chequeado que no cuentan con voceros especializados en esta problemática. Esa respuesta llegó el mismo día en que sus ejecutivos testificaban frente al gobierno estadounidense por este conflicto. En el Congreso de los Estados Unidos la empresa calculó que el 5% de sus cuentas son automatizadas o falsas, explicó qué están haciendo para frenarlo y cómo llegó a esa cifra, un número mucho menor que el presentado por la especialista en tendencias digitales Mary Meeker en mayo último cuando estimó que el 50% del tráfico online mundial, no sólo en Twitter, se trataba de bots. Expertos citados por el diario estadounidense The New York Times también creen que el número dado por las empresas es bajo.\n\nEn el trabajo realizado por este medio, el número de bots en etiquetas locales como #Macri fluctúa entre 3 y 10% dependiendo de la definición de bot con la que se trabaje. A nivel mundial hay países con una actividad de bots muy baja y otros donde el peso parece ser mayor que en la Argentina. ¿Qué tuvimos en cuenta para definir qué es un bot? Alta velocidad de tuiteo (la diferencia entre 3% y 10% guarda relación con que los primeros publicaron más de 60 tuits por día y los segundos, más de 120), relación negativa entre seguidos y seguidores (en general siguen más cuentas que las que los siguen), alta cantidad de retuits y más. Vale aclarar que no hay una manera tajante de definir un bot para un estudio de decenas de miles de cuentas. De lo contrario, Twitter los encontraría de manera simple y las borraría. En la jerga académica se habla de “cuentas que se comportan como bots”. Así los trabajamos nosotros.\n\nEn el trabajo realizado por este medio, el número de bots en etiquetas locales como #Macri fluctúa entre 3 y 10% dependiendo de la definición de bot con la que se trabaje.\n\nEn este contexto, nuestro país se destaca. Desde su puesto de investigadora en la Universidad de Cambridge donde trabajó el tema, Tanya Filer, dijo a este medio que “en la Argentina hay mucho talento, muchos que aprendieron sobre este tema y mucha creatividad tecnológica. Esa cultura hacker de darse maña se lleva muy bien con esta tecnología. Hacer un bot no es algo caro, pero las reglas del juego cambian a diario“. Esto es cierto: las agencias locales con las que tuvo contacto Chequeadotrabajan no sólo a nivel local sino para otros países de América Latina y España por caso. Sin embargo, pese a la inventiva criolla, esta no es una creación nacional.\n\nLas últimas imágenes muestran bots en distintos momentos que, en principio, llevaban agua para dos partidos diferentes. Este tipo de automatización muy simple es la que los asesores ya no recomiendan, simplemente porque no es efectiva y pueden quedar fácilmente en evidencia.\n\nBots mundiales\n\nHay registros, según una investigación de la Universidad de Oxford, de que al menos desde 2010 se hacen operaciones online en redes con el fin de implantar un tema o contrariar a otro. Este estudio informa que hasta 2017 se había encontrado este tipo de actividad en 28 países. Uno de los miembros de este exclusivo club, según la casa de estudios inglesa, es la Argentina.\n\nSin embargo, incluso en el estudio de Oxford, poco se sabe sobre cómo actúan estos grupos que, por definición, operan en las sombras. Una de las pocas veces que se logró una aparición visible fue en 2016. La revista Bloomberg logró que uno de estos estrategas, Andrés Sepulveda, hablara en on the record, pero no logró tener pruebas contundentes para que sus supuestos clientes, asesores del presidente mexicano Enrique Peña Nieto por caso, reconocieran que lo habían contratado. Su trabajo, según él mismo describió, iba más allá de trabajar con bots: “Lidera un equipo de hackers que roba estrategias de campaña, manipula las redes sociales para crear falsas olas de entusiasmo o crítica e instaló software espía en las oficinas de la oposición para ayudar a Peña Nieto”.\n\nLa revista dice que todo el pack de servicios de Sepulveda cuesta varios cientos de miles de dólares. Más allá de la diferencia en el tipo de trabajo, en las entrevistas locales nadie reconoció hackear a un oponente, ya que los montos argentinos son mucho menores y tienen que ser divididos en dos grandes grupos. Por un lado, los militantes partidarios pueden hacer un bot de manera muy simple, incluso con herramientas gratuitas, sea este trabajo pago o no, y por el otro las agencias que se dedican específicamente a esto y trabajan para un político hoy y mañana hacen lo mismo con una marca de consumo masivo. Estos últimos, profesionalizados, son el foco de esta nota y de ellos sale el paso a paso narrado más arriba.\n\nAsí se relacionaban las cuentas en Twitter, mediante respuestas o retuits, la noche de #DebateCapital sobre el término “Carrió”. La llamada “grieta” se ve claramente.\n\nUna de las agencias locales que ha hecho más ruido en el mundo político es Illuminati Lab. Poco se sabe sobre ellos en la Argentina, donde Chequeado intentó contactarlos sin éxito, pero en Ecuador fueron eje de una investigación periodística en 2013, donde se los acusa de ser parte de una campaña orquestada a favor de Rafael Correa y otra en contra de la petrolera Chevron. En la misma nota hacen referencia a que la firma aparece en mails filtrados a Wikileaks en los que intenta generar una relación con la reconocida empresa italiana de hackeo Hacking Team.\n\nSegún El Universo de Ecuador, Illuminati Lab promocionaba en su sitio que había trabajado en las campañas de Enrique Peña Nieto en México y Correa en Ecuador, desde aquel momento las páginas fueron dadas de baja, pero la firma sigue diciendo, por ejemplo en LinkedIn, que “actuaron en más de 20 procesos electorales”.\n\nEn su cuenta de Twitter proponen crear “estrategias inteligentes e innovadoras para gobiernos y elecciones”. La firma, con oficinas y espacio de coworking a metros del río en Olivos inaugurado en 2013 por el intendente Jorge Macri y los fundadores Carlos Ibañez y Gastón Douek, publicó en su propio blog una nota diciendo que “los ejércitos de bots y trolls crecen en tamaño, pero caen en importancia”. Pese a eso aún hoy la empresa sigue ofreciendo el servicio de creación de bots y ha trabajado en la Argentina con políticos de todos los polos, además de empresas.\n\nLos datos\n\nPara darle contexto local a este problema, Chequeado “grabó” a través de una herramienta que necesita cierto conocimiento técnico lo que se decía en los trending topics de Twitter por dos meses (desde el 12 de septiembre a la publicación de esta nota).\n\nEn esa “grabación” registramos no sólo los tuits, sino también las cuentas que los emitían, cuándo se habían creado, la cantidad de seguidores y los que eran seguidos por ellas. ¿Por qué? Porque ahí es donde los especialistas creen que reside la clave de qué es un bot.\n\n¿Cómo se hizo el trabajo? Bajamos todos los tuits que formaron parte de trending topics en la Argentina en los últimos dos meses. En general, detrás de un trending topic hay uno o dos hashtags. Luego hicimos un trabajo de procesamiento para obtener la lista de usuarios y una serie de atributos de los usuarios como la cantidad de followers que tiene, la cantidad de usuarios que sigue, cantidad de tuits, likes, cuándo se creó la cuenta. Guardamos los textos de los tuits y, por otro lado, las relaciones que nos permiten entender qué cuenta es influenciadora y por otro lado se puede ver, como en el gráfico siguiente, cómo se agrupan los usuarios en distintas comunidades”.\n\nLas nubes de tuits alrededor del discurso de Macri que abre la nota. En verde las cuentas con comportamiento de bot que tienen más de 60 tuits por día (y menos de 120) y en negro los que tienen más de 120 tuits por día.\n\nEs que, si bien no se puede asegurar (por eso este trabajo es complejo), en general los bots siguen a más cuentas de las que los siguen, tuitean más seguido que la cuenta promedio (ejemplo: @elsakekita), sólo retuitean (@rafaelsanzio7) y, sobre todo cuando las granjas eran más básicas, contaban con cuentas creadas todas el mismo día.\n\nPor otro lado pudimos acceder a un paper de futura publicación realizado por Ernesto Calvo, especialista en Ciencia Política de la Universidad de Maryland y Natalia Aruguete, investigadora de Conicet especializada en agenda mediática sobre el caso Maldonado. Allí ellos encontraron otros patrones interesantes: “En la comunidad opositora, ocho de las diez cuentas más importantes estaban verificadas por Twitter y representan actores políticos o periodísticos establecidos como @CFKArgentina, @eldestapeweb, y @FernandezAnibal. En la comunidad cercana al oficialismo, 8 de las 10 cuentas más importantes no habían sido verificadas y describen a fakes como @NunkMasKK, @elcoya77 y @atlanticsurff, conocidos por sus actividades anti-kirchneristas. La comparación entre las dos comunidades es llamativa precisamente por la cantidad de cuentas institucionales en la oposición y la casi ausencia de cuentas institucionales en la comunidad afín al gobierno”.\n\nLos 196 mil usuarios de la red que tuiteó sobre Maldonado desde el 1 de agosto al 19 de octubre y la poca relación entre ambos polos. Fuente: Aruguete – Calvo.\n\nTiempos de cambio\n\nSe suele decir que la regulación llega siempre tarde frente a la tecnología. Algo parecido pasa con la discusión pública sobre bots y trolls que en los últimos meses llegó hasta el Congreso con el diputado Felipe Solá (Frente Renovador) y el jefe de Gabinete de Ministros, Marcos Peña. Allí, en mayo último, luego de que Peña dijera que Sergio Massa, actual líder político del ex gobernador de la Provincia, era “tribunero” Solá contestó:”Enfrentar la tribuna y ser tribunero es capacidad para defenderse, para convencer, y valentía para dar la cara. A nosotros no nos dan la cara. Usted nos da la cara acá y después nos insulta, pero todos los días en las redes están los trolls. Todos los días. Si Sergio Massa es tribunero, usted es trollero. Pero usted no pone la cara, la ponen los pibes a los que les pagan migajas”. Esta idea de generar agenda a través de Twitter, sin embargo parece estar pasando de moda, coinciden todos los entrevistados. Chequeado contactó a Solá y su equipo para profundizar en esta afirmación y no recibió respuesta.\n\nDesde el Gobierno nacional, quien habló fue Guillermo Riera, subsecretario de Vínculo Ciudadano de la Jefatura de Gabinete hasta abril último (desde la Casa Rosada se pasó su contacto para hablar como voz autorizada de este tema). Riera negó en forma categórica la idea de que Jefatura cuenta con un call center de trolls y bots. “No sólo es mentira, sino que me molesta mucho que lo digan consultores en medios digitales que saben que para hacer lo que ellos dicen que hacemos se necesitan dos personas y una computadora, no un call center. Bots, trolls y más existen de todos los partidos políticos, pero son personas que lo hacen por su cuenta porque no tiene sentido invertir recursos en eso, es gritar que tenés razón”, explicó.\n\nAnte la pregunta sobre la escala del staff de redes sociales del Gobierno y el tamaño en relación al gobierno anterior, Riera fue tajante luego de aclarar que en la Casa Rosada trabajan aproximadamente 40 personas en Comunicación vía redes sociales: “No tengo ninguna duda de que nuestra escala es más grande. El gobierno anterior se despidió en 2015 hablando de Clarín, un diario que tira unos cientos de miles de ejemplares. Nosotros sabemos, y desde hace al menos cuatro años hacemos campaña así, que no sirve ese discurso y esa vía de comunicación no es tan clave como parece”.\n\nPese a las idas y vueltas entre políticos de distintos partidos sobre el tema, no hay denuncias específicas sobre bots en la Unidad Fiscal Especializada en Ciberdelincuencia (UFECI). “No estamos siguiendo causas relacionadas con bots. Lo que tenemos son denuncias de agresiones (amenazas, hostigamiento) a políticos a través de Internet, basadas por lo general en sus publicaciones en redes sociales; también tenemos casos de amenazas y hostigamiento a periodistas por lo mismo”, aseguró a Chequeado Horacio Azzolin, titular de la UFECI.\n\nEste tipo de acciones no está regulada por una normativa específica de Internet sino que se aplica el Código Penal, que regula por ejemplo las amenazas. “Amenazar personalmente o por Internet es lo mismo en el sentido en que es delito. Si la amenaza es anónima, la pena se agrava. Si la amenaza exige determinada prestación, la pena también se agrava”, precisó Azzolin.\n\nPero, ¿por qué esta estrategia de comunicación poco transparente está pasando de moda entre los asesores de políticos? Todos los entrevistados para esta nota coincidieron en que Twitter no es el mascarón de proa de una campaña digital política como lo era en 2011 y todavía para algunos en 2015. Facebook e Instagram, con varios millones de usuarios más que la red de los 140 caracteres en la Argentina, hoy marcan la agenda de qué hacer y qué no hacer. Entonces no por limitaciones éticas sino por simples limitaciones técnicas que hacen mucho más complicado generar ejércitos de bots en Facebook, el contenido automatizado deja de marcar agenda.\n\nTodos los entrevistados para esta nota coincidieron en que Twitter no es el mascarón de proa de una campaña digital política como lo era en 2011 y todavía para algunos en 2015.\n\n“Los bots empezaron por un malentendido”, explica Calvo a Chequeado. “La fantasía original de los partidos era que un número de seguidores se relacionaba con un número de votantes entonces invertían pensando en que un número grande se veía bien. Al poco tiempo, se dieron cuenta de que eso no funcionaba. ¿Es un engaño a los votantes? Sí”.\n\nEso no significa que vayan a desaparecer, pero su impacto fuera de Twitter es mucho menor que al de hace unos años. César Gazzo, ex asesor de Daniel Scioli en 2015 y consultor digital, lo dejó claro: “Este año fue muy raro ver publicidad de políticos en Twitter más allá del trending topic de cierre de campaña de Cambiemos. En 2015 era mucho más usual cruzarse con ese contenido pago”.\n\nLo que creen Calvo y Aruguete, quienes estudian juntos este tipo de fenómenos, es que de los bots simples se pasó a un sistema más sofisticado donde se le baja línea a influenciadores, pagos o no, para que actúen. Estos dejan una huella digital más concreta, con más impacto, pero que hace aún más difícil de detectar si se trata de algo armado o no.\n\nEn cuanto al criticado supuesto call center que tiene el gobierno actual, Mitchelstein cree que en realidad no son bots, sino el “staff que trabaja el discurso oficial en redes”. En este sentido, señaló: “Todo gobierno tiene eso. Pasaba con Cristina Fernández de Kirchner y la oposición en ese momento decía que todos eran empleados públicos usados para comunicar a favor de ella. Ahora dicen que es un call center. Eso habla de nuestra falta de confianza en la política”.\n\nHasta Gazzo, en la vereda opuesta de Cambiemos, dijo que no se imagina un call center dedicado a criticar a terceros. Cree que eso sí se hace, pero no desde una fila de escritorios en el corazón de la Casa Rosada como se imaginan muchos sino que forma parte de una estrategia distribuida. Esto incluiría, por ejemplo, mails, DMs o mensaje de WhatsApp que se activan en casos de no agresión como cuando en 2015 miles de cuentas alineadas con Cambiemos tuitearon #YoLoVoto. Si por un sistema similar surgen agresiones no se puede descartar. Gazzo cree que sí, pero lo difícil es probarlo. Consultado sobre qué le diría hoy a un político que quiere bots, el ex asesor de Scioli fue tajante: “Le diría que ni loco lo haga, que gaste esa plata en publicidad localizada en Facebook o Instagram donde puede llegar a un público mucho más específico y medible”.\n\nEn una charla en 2016, organizada por MESO, Gazzo contó lo bien que les hubiese venido en la campaña presidencial tener un retuit de la influencer número uno del peronismo: Fernández de Kirchner. Según él, el ex motonauta terminó la carrera al sillón de Rivadavia sin un solo RT de su supuesta líder política. A veces las redes son más transparentes que los actos políticos con sonrisas de ocasión. Más allá de lo simbólico, cualquier apoyo en redes sociales de ese tipo tiene mucho más impacto que una granja de bots.\n\nTodo esto se da en un contexto técnico y político cambiante que hace que esta nota tenga un final abierto que seguramente habrá que revisar en el futuro. Darle un número exacto al movimiento que generan los bots en la Argentina, fuera de temáticas específicas como la que abre esta nota, es imposible teniendo en cuenta todos los grises del caso, pero, mientras Twitter siga teniendo problemas para generar mejores barreras para crear y administrar cuentas, conocer las herramientas que se utilizan y cómo se comportan éstas parece el mejor antídoto frente a estas plagas virtuales. Quizás así ayudemos a que se cumpla la primera ley de la robótica del escritor Isaac Asimov: “Un robot no hará daño a un ser humano”.\n\nPablo M.

    "article_text": "Los problemas de basura, de veredas, pavimento y bacheo son los más reportados por los vecinos del Municipio CH, el más poblado de Montevideo. Entre diciembre y enero, el 49% de los reclamos fueron por estos temas.\n\nSe trata de los primeros resultados que arroja la nueva aplicación de este municipio, que en solo un mes de funcionamiento recibió 375 reportes por parte de 294 usuarios.\n\nLos ciudadanos de esta demarcación de Montevideo — que comprende los barrios de Tres Cruces, La Blanqueada, Parque Batlle, Villa Dolores, Buceo, Pocitos y Punta Carretas— hicieron 37 reportes (el 26% del total) por problemas en la limpieza. Según la Intendencia de Montevideo, esto ocurrió por un incremento en el consumo en época de las fiestas. La oposición política, en tanto, sostuvo que ocurrió por un problema de gestión.\n\nLos problemas en las veredas, pavimento y bacheo tuvieron 32 reportes (23%) y de alumbrado hubo 31 (22%). Con menos cantidad de reclamos aparecen temas de podas, raíces y arbolado (16 reportes), seguridad ciudadana (11), tránsito (9) y bocas de tormenta (5).\n\nSegún el mapa de calor, los lugares donde más se hicieron estos planteos fueron Pocitos y Punta Carretas.\n\nEsta aplicación, que busca cambiar el modo en que la ciudadanía se relaciona con el tercer nivel de gobierno, muestra que el 31% de los reclamos hechos por los ciudadanos ya fueron solucionados. El 53% de los 375 reportes \"están en gestión\" para ser resueltos.\n\nAlgunos planteos fueron declarados como \"inválidos\" ya sea porque el usuario no describió bien el inconveniente o por algún tipo de problema en la geolocalización. En ese caso, vuelven a comunicarse con quien reporta para que lo describa otra vez.\n\nLos usuarios pueden realizar comentarios sobre las denuncias hechas por otros ciudadanos (hubo 133 en este período) y también pueden \"validarlas\". Abt lo explica así: \"Si subís un reporte por un problema de limpieza en un contenedor o una luz que no funciona en la esquina de tu casa, y yo vivo en frente y sé que ese contenedor está desbordado o la luz está rota hace tiempo, yo apoyo tu reporte. Esto ayuda a que se le otorgue prioridad\".\n\nCómo funciona.\n\nEl desarrollo de esta aplicación fue uno de los planes que Abt tenía para su administración. Según contó, requiere una inversión de $ 45.000 mensuales.\n\nApenas el usuario descarga el servicio, disponible para teléfonos Android o Apple, aparece un botón que invita a añadir un problema barrial. Luego, se pide agregar una foto, en segundo lugar especificar la ubicación y por último escribir un título, una breve descripción y seleccionar una categoría temática.\n\nCuatro funcionarios que trabajan de lunes a viernes desde la mañana hasta las 18:00 horas cuentan con un software para recibir esta información. Tras tomar contacto con el reclamo, arman un expediente y, en 24 horas, notifican que están trabajando en el tema, aseguró el alcalde Andrés Abt.\n\nNo todos los problemas se solucionan de manera inmediata: si es un problema de reparación de alguna calle, podría implicar una mayor cantidad de tiempo debido a que generalmente está en un cronograma de obras. Si es un foco de luz, podría solucionarse en menos de un día.\n\nAntes, el proceso demoraba más. El ciudadano debía escribir un correo electrónico relatando de qué se trataba el problema. Muchas veces no tenía toda la información, faltaba alguna fotografía que dimensionara realmente el inconveniente o el vecino olvidaba detallar la ubicación. Además, llevaba un trabajo engorroso para los funcionarios, quienes reciben correos sobre otros temas.\n\n\"Esto genera un ritmo de comunicación e interacción con las personas y la búsqueda de la resolución del problema instantánea\", comentó Abt. \"Funciona como una red social interna del municipio con los ciudadanos\", agregó a El País Diego Barcia, gerente comercial de NiceStream, la empresa creadora de esta aplicación.\n\nDerivan a la IMM.\n\nMuchos de los reportes hechos por los vecinos son derivados a la Intendencia de Montevideo, ya que el municipio no tiene la competencia para resolverlos.\n\nAbt aseguró que en estos casos el Municipio hace el seguimiento: \"Le vamos informando a la persona que hizo el reclamo por dónde está su trámite\".\n\nHoy en día están en el proceso de que los reportes que se generen en esta app ingresen directamente al Sistema Único de Respuesta (SUR) de la IMM. Se trata de un sistema informático por el cual se canalizan todos los reclamos que llegan por todas las vías. Por ahora la forma de actuar es más \"artesanal\": los funcionarios del CH le avisan a la Intendencia cuáles son los reportes que corresponden a su competencia.\n\nBarcia aseguró a El País que en un plazo de dos meses todos los reclamos que se hacen en esta aplicación aparecerán automáticamente en SUR.\n\nAPP parecida.\n\nLa Intendencia de Montevideo colabora con una aplicación muy parecida llamada \"Por mi barrio\", que cuenta con el apoyo del Banco de Desarrollo de América Latina (más conocido como CAF).\n\nEste sistema, que además de Montevideo funciona en el departamento de Rivera, geolocaliza al usuario e invita a hacer el reporte dividido por temas.\n\nEn una nota divulgada por El País en septiembre del año pasado, se informó que Por mi barrio recibió un total de 637 reclamos en los primeros nueve meses de 2017 en toda la ciudad y que el 31% había sido solucionado. La aplicación del Municipio CH recibió más de la mitad en un mes.\n\nConsultado sobre si no existe una saturación de este tipo de servicios, Abt opinó que cada uno tiene un perfil específico. Barcia opinó que la app del CH, además de reportar problemas, es una herramienta de comunicación. Y que, de todas formas, el ciudadano posee un nuevo canal para reclamar.\n\nServicios sin vínculo con los gobiernos.\n\nAntes de que existieran estas plataformas que vinculan a los gobiernos departamentales y municipales con la ciudadanía, ya habían surgido aplicaciones colaborativas que forman comunidades de alerta vecinal.\n\nLa más famosa es Oincs, la cual cuenta con 150.000 usuarios registrados y llegó a ser una de las tres aplicaciones más descargadas en 11 países donde está disponible.\n\nEl servicio está principalmente enfocado en el tránsito: los usuarios pueden hacer reportes por accidentes, inspectores, trancazos, semáforos rotos, pozos, radares, desvíos, calles inundadas o vehículos mal estacionados. También es posible hacer denuncias por zonas peligrosas, manifestaciones, vandalismo, cuidacoches peligrosos y basura acumulada.\n\nCityCop, en tanto, está enfocada en los problemas de seguridad. Los usuarios pueden reportar por un robo a un auto, a una persona o a una casa, además de alertar por una boca de droga, un homicidio o un sospechoso.\n\nLos creadores de esta aplicación han tenido intención de vincularse con el Ministerio del Interior, pero no obtuvieron respuesta.\n\nCuatro departamentos detrás de la aplicación\n\n​ Pretenden crear servicios parecidos en casi todos los rincones del país Canelones, Treinta y Tres, Tacuarembó y Florida están interesados en tener esta aplicación desarrollada para el Municipio CH de Montevideo, informó a El País Diego Barcia, gerente comercial para el Cono Sur de NiceStream, la empresa creadora de este servicio.\n\nEl alcalde del CH, Andrés Abt, dijo que hay otros jefes municipales que se comunicaron con él para tener este mismo servicio y envió el contacto de Barcia para que inicien reuniones.\n\nLos encargados de esta empresa, que además del Municipio CH también crearon una aplicación similar para la Intendencia de San José, buscan estar presentes en la mayoría de los departamentos en 2019.\n\n\"Esto potencia la interacción entre el municipio y el ciudadano captando la problemática en base a determinados ejes\", comentó Barcia.\n\nSegún el experto, esto ayuda a las alcaldías a generar una \"percepción positiva\" sobre este nivel de gobierno. \"Si bien se gasta mucho dinero para solucionar problemas, el vecino solo se acuerda del municipio cuando sucede algo malo\", comentó Barcia. Por ejemplo, cuando un ciudadano observa en el territorio un semáforo roto, se acordará del gobierno en ese momento. \"Supongamos que ese municipio es el más eficiente del mundo y arregla ese semáforo en media hora. El ciudadano pasa otra vez por ahí y quizás no se da cuenta que fue arreglado. La percepción positiva no existe\", comentó. Este tipo de tecnologías, agregó, muestra cuáles son los problemas que fueron solucionados, que están escuchando a los vecinos y, en el fondo, mejoran la imagen de los jerarcas.\n\nEste tipo de servicio ya está presente en otras ciudades del mundo, por ejemplo de Chile y España.\n\nExpedientes.\n\nLa transformación hacia lo digital no solo abarca los reclamos y denuncias por parte de los ciudadanos. En el sitio web de la Intendencia de Montevideo ya se pueden iniciar al menos 150 trámites en línea. Próximamente se pretenden sumar otros 100 y, para finales de 2020, el objetivo es que todos los trámites puedan comenzarse en Internet.\n\nSegún cifras de la comuna, desde agosto del año pasado \"ahorró\" 122 árboles gracias a la aplicación del Sistema de Expediente Electrónico.\n\nAdemás, en octubre del año pasado, la Intendencia abrió un laboratorio de innovación ciudadana. Está instalado en el Cabildo de Montevideo, que busca la producción, experimentación y difusión de proyectos innovadores que apunten a mejorar la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos.",

    "article_text": "A pesar de que 75% de los nacionales repudia la administración de Donald Trump, siete de cada 10 cree que los productos y servicios que ofrecen las empresas estadounidenses son 'cool'.\n\nCIUDAD DE MÉXICO (Expansión) -\n\nLos temas políticos no influyen en la decisión de compra de los consumidores mexicanos, asegura Douglas Mello, jefe de Planeación de la agencia de marketing J. Walter Thompson.\n\nEl directivo, quien participó en la elaboración de ‘Brand America: Capítulo México’, estudio que analiza la percepción de las marcas de Estados Unidos en territorio mexicano, indica que ocho de cada 10 nacionales tiene una percepción positiva de éstas, a pesar de que 75% de ellos rechaza la administración del presidente Donald Trump y muestra antipatía por el país.\n\n“La gente tiene muy claro que los temas políticos de Estados Unidos no se mezclan con las marcas nacidas en el país del norte. De hecho, los mexicanos creen que éstas tienen mejor calidad, son más confiables y respetadas que las nacionales, por eso las prefieren”, menciona Mello.\n\nEl estudio –que se basó en las respuestas de 500 personas– revela que 77% de los consumidores cree que los productos y servicios que ofrecen las empresas estadounidenses son 'cool'.\n\nPara Rodrigo Mondragón, académico y especialista de la Facultad Mexicana de Arquitectura, Diseño y Comunicación de la Universidad La Salle, este reconocimiento se debe a que las marcas están muy arraigadas a la mentalidad del mexicano. “Algunas son muy recientes y otras más atractivas, pero al final todas han hecho una labor muy buena de construcción de marca, tanto que evitaron que el fenómeno Donald Trump afectara su reputación”, explica.\n\nLee más: Empresas mexicanas que se suben al trending de 'el muro'\n\nCoca-Cola, McDonald's, Google, Nike, Starbucks y Apple son algunas de las marcas que, según el estudio, tienen un espacio privilegiado en la preferencia de los mexicanos.\n\nEl directivo de J. Walter Thompson agrega que las marcas, además de implementar un gran trabajo de comunicación y de marketing, han sabido adoptar elementos de la cultura mexicana para conectarse con los locales, tanto así que hay consumidores que desconocen el lugar de origen de las empresas, pues aseguran que la cercanía que tienen con ellas les impide identificar con certeza de dónde vienen.\n\nLas exigencias del mexicano\n\nA los mexicanos no les gusta lo que el presidente de Estados Unidos dice del país, de acuerdo con el reporte. Ellos demuestran su inconformidad y exigen que sus marcas favoritas también lo hagan: 39% apreciaría más a las estadounidenses que tomaran una postura de descontento ante la polémica, mientras que 37% tendría más empatía con aquellas que tengan una posición ante temas que afectan a la sociedad.\n\nPero estas peticiones dejan de importar cuando los precios bajos se hacen presentes. Mello explica que seis de cada 10 consumidores locales compraría productos de una marca de Estados Unidos si el costo es mucho menor al de una empresa mexicana, ya que prefieren tener en sus manos artículos comercializados por una compañía global y que, según ellos, innova constantemente.\n\nLee más: El 'muro de Trump' acapara reflectores en la publicidad\n\nPara Oscar Kaufmann, director general de la agencia digital Nicestream México, este comportamiento es normal en el mexicano, pues asevera que la antipatía que demuestra por ciertas empresas desaparece en poco tiempo. “El mal comportamiento de una marca causa, al principio, un impacto negativo en los mexicanos. Sin embargo, éste no incide en su decisión de compra. Vivimos en un país donde no existe el concepto del superconsumidor, es decir, aquel individuo que se fija en la reputación de las empresas, por encima del precio y la calidad, antes de comprar un producto”, comenta.\n\nNoticias del día Dos envíos de lunes a viernes con las noticias más importantes. Suscríbete\n\nPese a esto, los expertos coinciden en que la polémica generada tras las declaraciones de Donald Trump puede representar una gran oportunidad para que las marcas mexicanas incrementen su presencia en el mercado nacional, en lugar de competir con las estadounidenses.\n\n“Las marcas locales deben aprovechar que nacieron en este país y construir su marca alrededor de un discurso nacionalista, que presuma la calidad y el origen de los productos, así como la virtud de sus rasgos culturales”, aconseja el académico de la Universidad La Salle.",

    "article_text": "A pesar de las iniciativas que propone la empresa de servicio de transporte, los expertos aseguran que será difícil recobrar la confianza de los usuarios.\n\nCIUDAD DE MÉXICO (Expansión) -\n\nCabify endereza el barco en su comunicación. Después de emitir posturas tardías, información irrelevante, poco empática y que sólo evidenciaba la falta de estrategias para responder a las acusaciones por el asesinato de Mara Castilla, la empresa de servicio de transporte privado empieza a dar pasos positivos para su reputación, en opinión de los especialistas en relaciones públicas.\n\n“Se tardaron mucho tiempo en reaccionar y, cuando lo hicieron, solo dieron datos que provocaron las quejas de la gente. Aunque, por fin, la compañía salió con propuestas para mejorar el servicio”, explica Rafael Garate, director general de Percepción e Imagen, agencia de relaciones públicas, comunicación estratégica y digital, quien asegura que desde la desaparición de la estudiante de 19 años en Puebla –el pasado 8 de septiembre–, debieron ofrecer soluciones.\n\nY aunque desarrollar un botón de pánico, agregar contactos de emergencia en el perfil del usuario, compartir la lista de conductores que han sido dados de baja por mal comportamiento y crear una mesa de diálogo con los responsables de plataformas de transporte similares son algunas de las iniciativas que la compañía busca implementar, “el daño ya está hecho”, asegura Oscar Kaufmann, director general de Nicestream México, agencia de comunicación digital.\n\nLEE MÁS: Cabify busca implementar un botón de pánico\n\n“El problema es volver a recuperar la confianza en la empresa que parecía ser la luz al final del túnel en cuanto a seguridad en el transporte. Los mensajes de Cabify desataron impotencia en los usuarios, que va a ser muy difícil que vuelvan a fiarse del servicio, aunque ahora la compañía esté actuando de manera responsable”, comenta.\n\nReputación a la baja\n\nSi bien para Cabify la prioridad no es recuperar su reputación como compañía, lo cierto es que los reclamos le están afectando.\n\nTanto así que ayer, el gobierno de Puebla canceló el registro de la empresa con el argumento de que carece de un sistema de seguridad. Diódoro Carrasco, secretario general del gobierno estatal, anunció que las irregularidades en los protocolos de la compañía salieron a la luz después de que el conductor Ricardo N. es señalado como el principal sospechoso de la muerte de Castilla.\n\nTras el anuncio, la empresa de transporte, que lleva seis años de operación en México, emitió un comunicado para anunciar su inconformidad, ya que asegura cumplir 100% con al regulación: “Nosotros respetamos a la autoridad. Pero nuestro conductor –que llevaba un mes trabajando en la plataforma– presentó todos los documentos requeridos y aprobó las pruebas psicométricas y toxicológicas. Incluso tenemos la constancia de antecedentes no penales”, refiere Diana Pantoja, directora de Comunicación de Cabify a nivel global, en entrevista para Expansión.\n\nAunque, apunta que por ahora no están enfocando en la reputación de la empresa. \"Lo más importante para nosotros es colaborar en lo que esté a nuestro alcance (…) Entendemos el dolor y la rabia de la gente, por eso seguimos revisando nuestros procesos y protocolos de servicio para cerciorar que nuestros clientes tengan una plataforma segura”, afirma.\n\nLEE MÁS: Puebla saca de circulación a Cabify\n\nEl papel de las redes\n\nEn redes sociales la historia no es diferente. Los perfiles de Facebook y Twitter de Cabify se convirtieron en las plataformas ideales para exigir que la empresa asuma su responsabilidad en el feminicidio de Mara Castilla e, incluso, hacer amenazas sobre no volver a utilizar la plataforma.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Las redes sociales están cambiando el juego y las empresas tienen que reaccionar lo más rápido posible. En México no hay una cultura de prevención y eso está afectando a las empresas”, comenta Kaufmann.\n\nSi bien no se trata de pelearse con los usuarios y responder a todas las personas que opinen, debe quedar claro que en las plataformas digitales, todo se mueve rápido, por lo que siempre se debe estar alerta de nuevas declaraciones.\n\nNoticias del día Dos envíos de lunes a viernes con las noticias más importantes. Suscríbete\n\nY a pesar de que no hay herramientas para combatir las crisis, Kaufmann recomienda utilizar la tecnología no sólo para interpretar la data, sino para generar mecanismos que impida que la historia se vuelva a repetir.\n\n“La credibilidad de la marca no se reconstruye de la noche a la mañana, por lo que la empresa debe dejar de emitir comunicados y salir a tocar la puerta de los grupos afectados. Debe asegurarse de generar las condiciones necesarias para recuperar la confianza de los usuarios”, apunta.",

    "article_text": "Para superar una crisis en el mundo virtual, no basta con emitir una disculpa, un equipo especializado debe frenar el efecto viral de los mensajes dañinos.\n\nCIUDAD DE MÉXICO (Revista Expansión) -\n\nNota del editor: Este artículo fue publicado originalmente en la edición 1212 de la revista Expansión y fue actualizado en la versión que se publica este 2 de agosto.\n\nEl daño está hecho. La “profunda disculpa” ofrecida por Oscar Muñoz, CEO de United Airlines, llegó tarde y los usuarios de redes sociales no lo perdonaron. Un par de días después de difundirse el video en el que un agente de seguridad arrastraba a un pasajero, el directivo de la aerolínea dio la cara. Sin embargo, las críticas ya habían inundado la red.\n\nEl problema, dice Rogelio Blanco, director senior de Comunicación Corporativa de Llorente & Cuenca México, es que la empresa no estaba capacitada para enfrentar una crisis online. “Se les fue de las manos, nunca dimensionaron que la situación iba a escalar al mundo virtual”.\n\nLo mismo sucedió con el club deportivo Cruz Azul: las críticas offline sobre su mal desempeño saltaron a las redes. El problema llegó cuando sus community managers decidieron bloquear usuarios para intentar callar las críticas, lo que para los especialistas no es más que una muestra de inmadurez, falta de estrategia y humildad para aceptar las opiniones negativas.\n\nLee: Qué hacer para no 'cruzazulearla' en redes\n\nUna estrategia contraria adoptaron marcas como Pepsi y Adidas que, tras ser severamente atacadas, aceptaron los errores cometidos. La refresquera explicó que “estaba tratando de proyectar un mensaje global de unidad, paz y entendimiento”, a través de su comercial en el que la modelo Kendall Jenner abandona una sesión de fotos para encabezar una manifestación. La empresa retiró el video.\n\nTambién Adidas lamentó el tropiezo cometido el pasado 18 de abril. “Felicitaciones, has sobrevivido al maratón de Boston” fue el mensaje que la firma envió a los asistentes que concluyeron la carrera. El texto despertó fuertes críticas debido a que, en 2013, tres personas murieron y casi 300 resultaron heridas por un atentado en la meta.\n\nOtro malentendido lo protagonizó recientemente Gatorade México, una de las marcas de Pepsico, al enviar un mensaje de felicitación a la clavadista Paola Espinosa por estrenarse en su faceta de madre. \"Paola, felicidades por obtener la medalla más grande de todas: ser mamá\", publicó la marca en su cuenta de Twitter. El comentario fue calificado de \"sexista\" por los usuarios.\n\nGatorade no emitió su postura ante la polémica y fue la deportista quien horas después 'apagó el fuego' con un tuit de agradecimiento en el cual afirmaba que su medalla más grande sí era ser mamá.\n\nHoy, una crisis en redes sociales puede ser la causa del hundimiento de una empresa. Por esto, los expertos ofrecen cuatro recomendaciones para salir triunfantes de una polémica online.\n\n1. Escuchar las críticas\n\nEl primer paso ante una crisis es la aceptación. La empresa tiene que prestar atención a los mensajes emitidos por los consumidores, monitorear la actividad que se genera alrededor de la marca en redes sociales y hacer un diagnóstico de lo que provocó el desequilibrio, que, según explica Óscar Kaufmann, director general de la agencia de comunicación digital Nicestream México, puede tener su origen en dos vertientes:\n\nUno, en comentarios del mundo offline que traspasen al digital o dos, que la inexperiencia del community manager, encargado de la comunicación online, lo lleve a compartir contenido poco favorecedor o erróneo para la marca.\n\nRecomendamos: Crisis en redes sociales, el dolor de cabeza de las empresas en América Latina\n\n2. Solucionar el problema\n\nEs imprescindible tener un departamento encargado de resolver cualquier crisis digital. Este equipo debe crear un plan estratégico, en el menor tiempo posible, y evitar que las críticas trasciendan, lo que se convierte en una batalla contra el reloj y los usuarios que, en cuestión de minutos, pueden convertir un mensaje negativo en un trending topic capaz de terminar con la reputación de una marca, apunta Rogelio Blanco, director senior de Comunicación Corporativa de Llorente & Cuenca México.\n\nEl área de gestión de crisis debe tener la capacidad de identificar los mensajes, ya que puede tratarse de usuarios fantasma creados por la competencia.\n\n3. Disculparse por el incidente\n\nMostrar una cara humilde y abierta a la crítica constructiva es el tercer paso para remediar una crisis reputacional. Después de identificar la causa del contratiempo y verificar que los mensajes provienen de cuentas reales, la marca tiene que asumir la responsabilidad de lo ocurrido a través de un comunicado en el que quede clara su postura, recomienda María de la Luz Ascanio, profesora de la Escuela de Negocios del Tec de Monterrey.\n\nUna disculpa es la única forma de mostrarse vulnerable ante el público y frenar el efecto viral. Posteriormente, habrá que continuar con el monitoreo hasta asegurarse de que la mala racha ha perdido relevancia o ha terminado.\n\n4. Protegerse y evitar futuras crisis\n\nContratar personal capacitado para el manejo de redes sociales, que conozca la esencia de la marca y comparta contenido adecuado, es el primer paso para blindarse de futuros percances digitales, advierte Blanco.\n\nEn cuanto al departamento de gestión, no se trata de que colabore únicamente cuando haya que frenar un incidente, sino que trabaje constantemente en la generación de técnicas que protejan a la empresa. Finalmente, hay que recordar que en redes sociales las tendencias cambian constantemente, así que cualquier crisis, por más fuerte que sea, será reemplazada por una más polémica.\n\n\n\n\n\nConoce cómo detectar noticias falsas en las redes sociales",

    "article_text": "“Necesito una redacción para SEO”\n\nSi eres redactor es muy posible que hayas recibido un mensaje con estas mismas palabras. Probablemente se te pusieron los pelos de punta al leerlas por primera vez.\n\nNo hay porqué preocuparse: lo que te están pidiendo no difiere tanto del tipo de redacción al que estás acostumbrado. Sin embargo, ahí van algunos consejos que pueden ser útiles a la hora de enfrentarse a la redacción SEO.\n\n¿Qué es el SEO?\n\nSe trata del proceso de mejorar la visibilidad de un sitio web en los resultados de los distintos buscadores.\n\nEl SEO (Search Engine Optimization) es una disciplina variable. Google cambia los algoritmos cada cierto tiempo, por lo que es conveniente mantenerse actualizado. Existen distintas técnicas y estrategias para trabajar el posicionamiento web.\n\n¿Qué es la redacción SEO?\n\nSe trata de la creación de contenidos escritos para favorecer el posicionamiento web orgánico en buscadores. Redacción para SEO, escritura SEO, artículos orientados a SEO,… todos estos nombres hacen referencia a este tipo de redacción.\n\nSe trata que los textos ayuden a que una web obtenga una mejor posición en los buscadores al realizar una búsqueda por una determinada palabra clave. Esa mejor posición debería traducirse en un incremento orgánico de las visitas.\n\nEl SEO es un trabajo a medio-largo plazo y se divide en diversos frentes. Existen diversas herramientas SEO que te guiarán en la tarea de mejorar el posicionamiento de tu web.\n\n¿Hace falta ser Especialista SEO?\n\nNo es necesario (si bien es importante tener nociones sobre la materia). Tal como hemos apuntado antes: el SEO se divide en diversos frentes. La redacción SEO es solamente uno de ellos. Por supuesto, para mejorar el posicionamiento web orgánico, es imprescindible contar con un profesional que se ocupe de coordinar todos los frentes.\n\nConsejos para una buena redacción SEO\n\n✒ Sé original: es fundamental. Si recogemos información de distintas fuentes, debemos re-escribirlos de nuevo. El copy-paste es tu peor enemigo.\n\n✒ Ten en mente a tu target: si quieres evitar que eleve la tasa de rebote debes tener en mente a tu lector ideal. No es lo mismo escribir para jovencitas que quieren leer sobre sus ídolos pop que hacerlo para altos ejecutivos que quieren estar al corriente sobre la actualidad económica internacional.\n\nGoogle tiene en cuenta el comportamiento del usuario en la web, de forma que debes procurar evitar la tasa de rebote y que el usuario visite varias páginas de tu web antes de irse.\n\n✒ Crea contenido de valor: ten en cuenta por qué llega el lector a la página y procura ofrecerle contenido relevante. Cuanto mayor sea el valor de tu contenido, mejor.\n\n✒ Cuida la longitud: lo ideal son textos ricos, superiores a 300 palabras. Sin embargo, lo principal es que tengan sentido en el contexto. Si no hay contenido para tanto es mejor no forzar.\n\n✒ Atención a las palabras clave: las palabras clave deben estar en el texto. Cuanto más al principio, mejor. Evita forzar errores sintácticos, haz que tus frases tengan sentidos. Los buscadores tienen en cuenta la densidad global de todas las páginas: procura no repetir en exceso o podría interpretarse como keyword stuffing.\n\n✒ Utiliza sinónimos: Google cada vez es mejor interpretando sinónimos, por lo que una vez hayamos cumplido los requerimientos de palabras clave, no viene mal si utilizamos sinónimos o variaciones de la expresión.\n\n✒ Cuida la ortografía: revisa que no existan errores gramaticales, sintácticos u ortográficos. Google odia el contenido mal escrito tanto como los lectores.\n\n✒ Utiliza links y negritas: resalta con negrita la información especialmente clave y no dudes en enlazar otra página si el link tiene valor para el lector.\n\n✒ Olvídate del SEO: no te obsesiones. Sé natural en tu redacción. Escribe para tus lectores, no para Google. Si en algún momento llegas a un conflicto Google vs Usuario, debes favorecer siempre al usuario.\n\nTítulos para SEO\n\nEl cometido del título de cualquier artículo (adaptado para posicionamiento web o no), es persuadir al lector potencial. Tal como ya vimos con los asuntos en Email Marketing, el copywriting puede ayudarnos a mejorar la tasa de clic.\n\nLa longitud del titular debe ser entre 40 y 70 caracteres y es importante introducir la palabra clave del artículo (cuanto más a la izquierda, mejor).\n\n¿Cuál ha sido tu experiencia con la redacción para SEO? ¿Ya te has enfrentado a textos para Google? ¿Con qué problemas te has encontrado?\n\n¡Espero tus comentarios al respecto!",

Por eso te explicamos lo que especialistas recomiendan en casos como el del pasajero de United Airlines.\n\n\n\nPrimero hay que entender que la sobreventa de boletos está autorizada en México y el mundo. Sin embargo, como usuario debes saber que la Ley de Aviación Civil dice que cuando se hayan expedido boletos en exceso a la capacidad de las aeronaves, la empresa debe reintegrar el ticket, ofrecer transporte sustituto, transportar en la fecha inmediata y dar una indemnización de al menos 25 por ciento del precio del viaje no realizado.\n\n\n\nSi el vuelo disponible es el día siguiente, la aerolínea debe proporcionar al pasajero servicio de comunicación telefónica, alimentos en el tiempo de espera hasta el embarque del otro viaje, alojamiento en el hotel del aeropuerto o afuera, en caso de requerir pernoctar, así como transporte desde y hacia el aeropuerto, según el Artículo 52 de la ley.\n\n\n\nEn primera instancia en un vuelo sobrevendido la tripulación preguntará si hay voluntarios para bajar del avión. Algo de suma importancia a saber es que los asientos designados tienen preferencia.\n\n\n\n“En el caso del pasajero de United dudo que lo que se vio en el video haya sido la única historia por contar, debe de haber algo como que estaba en una lista de espera, se sentó en un asiento designado para otra persona, porque ninguna aerolínea llama al personal de seguridad por nada”, dijo Roberto del Cueto, capitán en una aerolínea que pidió no identificar.\n\n\n\nEn un video se observa como personal de seguridad de United arrastra a un hombre que se resistió a bajar de la aerolínea. “Lo que hay que hacer en esos casos es con todo el coraje del mundo bajarse y negociar la compensación, acercarse a los módulos de información en los aeropuertos, pero bajo ningún motivo el caso de United es aceptable”, indicó Francisco Corona, secretario de prensa de la Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores de México.\n\n1\n\n\n\nUNITED ‘ATERRIZAJE FORZOSO’\n\n\n\nTras la difusión del video en el que un pasajero es arrastrado por policías que lo obligan a bajar en un vuelo de United, la acciones de la aerolínea cayeron 1.1 por ciento al cierre de ayer.\n\n\n\nHace poco, Óscar Muñoz, CEO de United, recibió el premio como comunicador del año que otorga PRWeek, la principal publicación de relaciones públicas. Sin embargo, 25 días después salió a dar la cara por el polémico video de la aerolínea.\n\n\n\nOscar Kaufmann, CEO de Nicestream México, aseguró que en medio de una crisis, “pones a alguien menos valioso en tu ecosistema de comunicación como primera contención, porque es una pieza que posiblemente vas a sacrificar”.\n\n\n\n*Con información Alba Velasco\n\n",

No es bueno hacerse de la vista gorda\n\nKaufmann fue vocero de Minera México cuando ocurrió el desastre de la mina Pasta de Conchos en 2005, por lo que sabe que no se puede voltear a otro lado cuando todos hablan de un suceso.\n\n“Los mecanismos de contención no son fáciles y exigen un cambio en la cultura de comunicación muy profundo, pues le comunicas a muchos líderes de opinión, que son tus usuarios”.\n\nEn ese sentido, demorar una semana en publicar un comunicado habla mal de la empresa, pues además de ser una comunicación de una sola vía. “Me quedé con el mal sabor de boca de pensar si realmente esa era la solución: más allá de decir si despedí a los responsable se debe de hablar de medidas preventivas o de control para empleados que se hacen los chistosos y sólo se queda en un despido” dice Marcela Hernández, coach empresarial y experta la materia.\n\n2. Todos los empleados importan\n\nUn empleado enojado, puede terminar con el trabajo de 93 años. En el caso de La Costeña, aunque se tratara de trabajadores temporales, se debió establecer un vínculo más estrecho con su capacitación para que una simple ocurrencia o broma de mal gusto no tuviera como escenario el lugar de trabajo.\n\n“Aunque la empresa ya haya pedido perdón, el problema de las crisis es que sean verdad o mentira, el consumidor ya tiene un impacto en la mente. Recursos humanos, dirección general y la empresa tienen que tener un compromiso con ellos”, dice.\n\n3. No importa qué tan grande seas, te afecta\n\nTener miles de empleados y exportar a 50 países no te salva de un escándalo mediático, una opinión negativa, que en apariencia pueda ser inofensiva, puede ser muy dañina si no existe una adaptación de la empresa.\n\n“Puedes ser una empresa muy tradicional con 93 años de existencia, pero hablamos de qué tanto las empresas como esta se han abierto a los cambios de la era digital: o los adoptas o la misma ola te destruye”, comenta la especialista.\n\n4. Cualquiera tiene poder para opinar\n\nEl enojo motiva y enciende las conversaciones en redes sociales. Un estudio demuestra que un mensaje negativo en redes sociales es mucho más influyente que uno positivo, por lo que se disipa más rápidamente.\n\n“Las redes sociales son una fuenteovejuna social que de repente elige un villano favorito por algo que se filtró o se comunicó a veces con agendas oscuras por detrás. Por el espacio que le dan los medios genera una atención muy alta que redunda en una cascada de retuiteos que convierten en medios mismos y nadie los para”, dice Kaufmann.\n\n5. No puedes pagar por influir\n\nEl modelo de comunicación clásico de las empresas dictaba que se podía pagar por un spot, artículo o comentario positivo en medios tradicionales, pero hoy, una persona con suficiente número de seguidores “influencer” puede tener mucho más peso que cualquier comentario pagado.\n\nAdemás, la tentación de contener comentarios negativos con el uso de cuentas automáticas o “bots” es una técnica que aunque parece novedosa, es contraproducente.\n\n“La gente que hoy maneja redes sociales a partir de uso de bots es la peor mentira porque no se contiene y no impulsan nada, se detectan ya con cualquier herramienta como cuentas falsas, no generan conversación y se hace evidente un mal manejo”, dice Kaufmann.",

    "article_text": "“Madre de tres, voluntaria y promotora de arte popular”, así se define Juana Cuevas en su cuenta de Twitter, red social en la que su imagen de perfil es una foto de ella besando en la mejilla a José Antonio Meade, su esposo por 23 años y virtual candidato presidencial por el PRI.\n\nLa licenciada en Economía por el Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM), en donde conoció al ex secretario de Hacienda, saltó a la escena pública cuando Meade anunció su precandidatura por la coalición todos por México, integrada por el PRI, el Partido Verde y Nueva Alianza.\n\nDesde entonces, asiste a cada una de los eventos del candidato, interactúa con los simpatizantes priistas, responde cuestionamientos de la prensa y sus fotos aparecen con frecuencia en las redes sociales de Meade.\n\nEsta sobreexposición de la imagen de Cuevas no es fortuita, advierte Andrés Elías, consultor político en Comunicación Digital.\n\nPUBLICIDAD\n\n“El uso de la imagen de Juana Cuevas en la campaña de Meade tiene que ver directamente con una imagen que quieren posicionar: un hombre de familia y con el objetivo de mimetizarse con un ciudadano común y corriente, porque es lo que se busca en esta campaña: menos PRI y más Meade”, apunta el también creador de Datametrix, un sistema digital de análisis y predicción de intención de voto.\n\nLa integración de las esposas a las campañas electorales, generalmente, también busca formar una imagen “suave” y más social de los políticos que buscan la silla presidencial o algún puesto de elección popular.\n\nEn ese sentido, Cuevas representa una de las cartas fuertes de la campaña de Meade, sin embargo, desde la perspectiva del asesor de marketing, está siendo utilizada en un momento muy temprano de la contienda, además de no estar generando el impacto que se busca.\n\n“Se trata de una imagen empática, cercana a la gente, tiene una historia muy interesante, pero este no era el momento para exponerla a la atención mediática, es una carta muy agresiva. Al revisar los números de Juana Cuevas, por lo menos en redes sociales, creo que ella no causa demasiado impacto todavía y se refleja en el número de seguidores”, detalla el especialista en entrevista con Forbes.\n\nPero Cuevas no es la única bajo los reflectores de la campaña política. Beatriz Gutiérrez Müller, escritora de 49 años y esposa de Andrés Manuel López Obrador, apareció en noviembre del año pasado en un video que se propagó con velocidad en el que interpreta “El Necio”, canción de Silvio Rodríguez, mismo que forma parte del documental sobre la vida del candidato de Morena.\n\nLa presencia de Gutiérrez Müller es menos constante y está más en sintonía con el rol tradicional que se les asigna a las esposas de los candidatos en elecciones pasadas e incluso a las Primeras Damas de los países de América Latina.\n\nPor su parte, de Carolina Martínez, licenciada en administración y esposa de Ricardo Anaya candidato a la presidencia por la coalición PAN, PRD y Movimiento Ciudadano, se sabe poco y existen pocos registros de su acompañamiento en actos públicos a su cónyuge, con quien tiene tres hijos.\n\n“Generalmente en los países de Latinoamérica el papel de la Primera Dama ocupa un rol muy secundario. En contraste, en Estados Unidos tienen un perfil menos allegado a la política, pero más enfocado en temas sociales, por ejemplo, Michelle Obama, quien encabezó muchas iniciativas como la de la campaña para erradicar el sobre peso y la comida chatarra en las escuelas”.\n\nLa esposa de Barack Obama es una muestra del éxito que puede tener la integración de una esposa a la campaña, así como en algunas actividades de gestión de una administración. Después de todo, no sólo era la abanderada de la campaña pública para reducir la obesidad infantil en Estados Unidos, Let’s Move, sino que apareció en más de una decena de portadas de revistas de moda o política, participó en programas de televisión, pronunció discursos a favor de su esposo en las contiendas electorales e incluso, la imagen del abrazo entre ella y el ex presidente estadounidense, fue el mensaje con más retuits en la historia hasta 2012.\n\nLa imagen de Michelle Obama, así como la de la familia presidencial se cuidó hasta el último detalle, pero sobre todo fue llevada con congruencia entre lo que expresaba el presidente y las acciones de la familia entera.\n\n“Era una familia que reflejaba cercanía y una vida en la media de lo posible, muy similar a las familias promedio de ese país, cosa que no ocurre en México. Parece más como un grupo de privilegiados que están en el balcón presidencial”, apunta Elías.\n\nEn algunos casos, más que integrar a sus parejas a una campaña por un puesto de elección popular, los equipos de los candidatos prefieren mantenerlas con mucho celo lejos de los reflectores. Tal es el caso de Melania Trump, cuya presencia en actos públicos, ya sea por su forma de vestir o cuando fue acusada de plagiar un discurso de Michelle, ha generado efecto negativo.",

Companies House, the register of U.K. companies, lists Julian Wheatland, the chairman of SCL Group, as an Emerdata director. Wheatland was slated to be the next full-time CEO of Cambridge Analytica and led the conference call with employees to discuss Wednesday’s news.\n\nCambridge Analytica’s Chief Data Officer and former acting CEO Alexander Tayler is also listed as an Emerdata director.\n\nCambridge Analytica backer Rebekah Mercer and her sister Jennifer Mercer are also listed as directors of Emerdata.

The firm’s business is described as “data processing, hosting and related activities” in the Companies House filing.\n\nCambridge Analytica’s former CEO Alexander Nix was also a director of Emerdata, although Companies House records show that he resigned from the latter role on March 28, 2018, eight days after he was suspended by Cambridge Analytica.\n\nReports emerged earlier this year that Cambridge Analytica improperly used information from as many as 87 million accounts on the social network, prompting Facebook to suspend the U.K.-based company. Cambridge Analytica, which has ties to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign, denies any wrongdoing.\n\nFACEBOOK OUTLINES STEPS TO COMPLY WITH NEW PRIVACY LAWS FOLLOWING CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA SCANDAL\n\nIn its statement released Wednesday, Cambridge Analytica reiterated its “unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully,” but said that a “siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers.”\n\nCambridge Analytica has not yet responded to a request for comment on this story.\n\nThe Associated Press and Fox News’ Chris Ciaccia contributed to this article.\n\nFollow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers",

Bankruptcy filings in New York show that Cambridge Analytica received an $8.8 million loan from Emerdata before it entered administration, according to the FT.\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted Nix for comment. He has not commented on the allegations so far. People familiar with the matter told the FT that Nix's withdrawal came shortly after the data breach story exploded and was made in \"exchange for unbooked services.\" He intends to repay part of the money, the FT said.\n\nNix was asked about the alleged transaction on Wednesday when he appeared before British lawmakers to answer questions about the Facebook data scandal. \"What I can say is that the allegation in that article is false. The facts in that article are not correct,\" he said.\n\nIt is the second time he will give evidence to the powerful Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee after lawmakers fear he may have misled them during his first hearing.\n\nWhat is Emerdata?\n\nEmerdata was incorporated in the UK last year by several Cambridge Analytica executives before the Facebook scandal thrust their activities into the spotlight.\n\nRebekah and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of hedge fund tycoon and prominent Trump supporter Robert Mercer, joined Emerdata as directors as the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit. Another notable director was Johnson Chun Shun Ko, an executive with close links to another Trump supporter, Erik Prince.\n\nThe timing of the appointments contributed to media speculation that Emerdata could succeed Cambridge Analytica, since it involved many of the same people and backers.\n\nBut Nigel Oakes, founder of Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL, told Bloomberg in May that Emerdata had gone into administration. \"The whole lot is gone,\" he said.",

There’s no secret. For anything like this to recreate itself you need a team of people to work together but nobody is working together. Everybody has gone off to do their own things.\"\n\nOakes said the original idea when Emerdata was founded last year was to acquire Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections to put them under one roof. He added that Firecrest Technologies, another company created in March by former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, would also be shut down. Firecrest’s main shareholder was Emerdata, according to Bloomberg.\n\nOakes did not give any indication about what would happen to Cambridge Analytica's voter profile data, but it's possible it could be sold to the highest bidder, at least in the U.S. Despite insolvency proceedings, the firm will still have to contend with a ruling from Britain's privacy watchdog ordering it to hand over the data it has on a U.S. resident in addition to investigations into the firm's practices.\n\nHe also did not say if SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections, would also be winding down.\n\nCambridge Analytica is at the center of a global debate about data privacy for allegedly breaking Facebook's rules to obtain the personal data of up to 87 million of the social network's users. The company reportedly used the data to create psychological profiles of Facebook users to target them with ads on behalf of the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election and on behalf of those advocating that Great Britain should leave the European union ahead of the Brexit vote that same year.",

That document reveals the company has between $1 and $10 million in debt with very little assets. On May 2, SCL Elections Ltd. and its other British affiliates filed similar \"insolvency\" documents with UK authorities.\n\nIt was revealed last month that a 2014 survey app created at the behest of Cambridge Analytica required Facebook login credentials and provided the survey creator access to their friends' public profile data. In the end, this system captured data from 87 million Facebook users. This data trove wound up in the hands of Cambridge Analytica, the British data analytics firm, which worked with clients like the Donald Trump presidential campaign.\n\nNBC News reported Friday that the company's May 2 shutdown hit employees abruptly, with many remaining employees filing out of their Fifth Avenue office in Manhattan directly to a nearby Irish pub.\n\n“You know how people go through the stages of grief? This was acceptance,” a former executive said. “You could kind of see the writing on the wall, but most people never thought it was going to be total bankruptcy.”\n\nIn a May 2 statement on its website, Cambridge Analytica maintains that it did nothing wrong and that \"despite the Company’s efforts to correct the record, [it] has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\"\n\nThe company describes the global media coverage as a \"siege\" that has \"driven [away] virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers. As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.\"\n\nThe Friday court document also notes that the attorney preparing the filing was paid for by Emerdata, a new data analytics firm founded by many of the same people who were formerly involved in Cambridge Analytica. Emerdata, like Cambridge Analytica, is largely funded by the Mercer family, who are well-known Republican donors and Trump supporters. Rebekah Mercer was named as a director to Emerdata in March 2018. What exactly Emerdata does or how it will operate going forward remains a bit of a mystery.\n\nCurious creditors\n\nThe new bankruptcy filing lists 33 creditors—or entities that Cambridge Analytica owes money to. This group not only includes companies (Verizon Wireless) and law firms, but, curiously, various public entities including the Federal Election Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, and Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), among others.\n\n\"As one of multiple government investigators listed in the bankruptcy filing as a creditor (including the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Election Commission), the Senate Commerce Committee has an outstanding request for information from Cambridge Analytica,\" emailed Frederick Hill, a Thune spokesman.\n\nThune is the head of the Senate Commerce Committee, which recently held hearings on the Cambridge Analytica and Facebook debacle. The committee obviously does not provide commercial services or charge for those non-existent services.\n\nFew of the other public entities listed above immediately responded to Ars’ inquiries.\n\n\"We can’t comment,\" Judith Ingram, an FEC spokeswoman, emailed Ars. Ingram added that she was not aware of the agency commonly turning up as a creditor in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nStephen Spaulding, the chief of strategy at advocacy group Common Cause and a former special counsel at the FEC, told Ars that he guessed that listing was because of a pending legal complaint brought to the FEC.\n\n\"The reason they would be listed in a bankruptcy would be that this pending legal action might leave them exposed legally and maybe that’s why it has to be disclosed,\" he said. \"Why they’re listed as a creditor would be a question for a bankruptcy lawyer.\"",

The company acquired the information without the knowledge of Facebook users who ran a personality quiz app created by a University of Cambridge professor.\n\nCambridge Analytica is widely thought to have helped Donald Trump’s social media campaign to promote his bid to be elected President of the United States.\n\nAccording to a statement by the controversial data analytics firm, it’s all the media’s fault that Cambridge Analytica is now closing its doors:\n\n“Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations. The siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company’s customers and suppliers. As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business.”\n\nHmm. Well, I doubt that their chief executive being secretly filmed saying that they engaged in bribery, dug up dirt on political rivals, and weren’t above using “very beautiful” Ukrainian girls as honeypots, helped their image very much.\n\nPersonally I won’t be shedding any tears.\n\nMP Damian Collins, who chairs the Department of Culture, Media, and Sport select committee, tweeted that Cambridge Analytica should not be allowed to escape investigation just because it has gone down the plughole.\n\nCambridge Analytica and SCL group cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing. The investigations into their work are vital — Damian Collins (@DamianCollins) May 2, 2018\n\nInvestigation is definitely needed. Hours before Cambridge Analytica threw in the towel, security researcher Chris Vickery shared evidence with UK parliamentarians that appeared to show Cambridge Analytica and AggregateIQ (AIQ) worked together to build tools that may have assisted various groups behind the narrow victory for the pro-Brexit campaign in Britain’s divisive 2016 referendum.\n\nAIQ, like Cambridge Analytica, has been banned by Facebook, and is currently being investigated by Canadian authorities for possible violations of privacy law and unauthorised access to data.\n\nVickery was able to present his findings because umm.. the firms carelessly left it available for anybody to freely download from the internet, without asking for so much as a password. So much for taking data security seriously.\n\nSo, Cambridge Analytica is no more. People will have lost their jobs. But don’t be too quick to shed a tear.\n\nIt turns out that the founders of Cambridge Analytica have registered a new data analytics company, that they have called Emerdata.\n\nWhat’s the betting that the thinking behind Emerdata might be very similar to Cambridge Analytica?",

    "article_text": "Alexander Nix, the ousted CEO of Cambridge Analytica, the now-defunct data firm that worked on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential run, made his long-awaited return to Parliament on Wednesday. It was Nix's first appearance in front of U.K. lawmakers since Cambridge Analytica's allegedly illegal data practices were revealed to the world, sparking a global reckoning over how tech companies like Google and Facebook harvest, share and monetize the personal data of the billions of people who use their platforms. But anyone hoping for repentance, regret or answers to even basic questions from Nix was out of luck.\n\nRelated Taibbi: An Ode to the Feeble Corporate Apology Some of America's biggest capitalist entities are begging for forgiveness on TV – while barely acknowledging their sins\n\nWhat we got, instead, was a galling display of victimhood and evasion. Nix blamed the \"global liberal media\" for unfairly targeting his firm that, quite literally, unfairly targeted unsuspecting Facebook users. He blamed former colleagues who had spoken out for nursing a grudge against him. He characterized Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie, who helped expose the company's murky origins, ties to alt-right leader Steve Bannon and dubious business practices, as \"resentful\" and a \"liar.\"\n\n\n\n\"So, you are the victim in all this?\" one member of Parliament, Brendan O'Hara, asked.\n\n\n\n\"If you're sitting where I am right now,\" Nix said, \"you'd probably feel quite victimized.\"\n\n\n\nOver the course of three-and-a-half hours, Nix's responses veered from outright denials to bald defiance and thinly veiled anger at his questioners. Confronted with his own comments from an undercover investigation by the U.K.'s Channel 4 that showed Nix telling a potential political client about the use of honeypots, bribes and other underhanded tactics, he mustered an unconvincing denial. He now said that he meant those tactics had been used by other companies, not his own. \"I didn't commit to doing anything for them,\" he said. \"I simply played along and listened to this potential client's desires.\"\n\n\n\n\"Surely any reasonable person would think that was an offer?\" MP O'Hara asked.\n\n\n\n\"You don't need to sit there and sully my reputation; I've already done that to a worldwide audience,\" Nix replied. \"It was foolish of me, and it was a well-crafted entrapment, sting – whatever you want to call it.\" Ever the Old Etonian, he added: \"Chapeau\" – hat's off – \"to Channel 4 for destroying an excellent British technology company.\"\n\n\n\nCambridge's downfall began in March, when the New York Times and the Observer reported that the company had harvested the personal Facebook data of up to 50 million people, most without their consent or knowledge, as part of the company's business strategy that included electing Republican politicians such as Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). Backed by millions of dollars from the wealthy right-wing Mercer family, Nix and his team used that Facebook data and much more from thousands of other sources to build personality profiles of 230 million American voters in an effort to sway their opinions. (The results of those efforts were decidedly mixed.) \"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons,\" Wylie told the Observer. \"That was the basis the entire company was built on.\"\n\nPress Association/AP\n\nFacebook later said that the number of users affected by the breach was as high as 87 million. In the weeks that followed, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced tough questions (and some pathetic ones, too) from lawmakers in the House and Senate. Facebook as a company lost more than $50 billion in market value in a matter of weeks as government agencies and law enforcement officials opened investigations into privacy and data practices in Silicon Valley and beyond.\n\n\n\nFacebook's stock has since recovered, and the company is trying to move on from the data controversy. The same can't be said for Cambridge Analytica. The fallout from the Channel 4 sting, coming on the heels of the data-harvesting revelations in the media, led to Nix's eventual removal as CEO. Cambridge Analytica itself went into a tailspin. On May 2nd, the company announced that it was shutting down.\n\n\n\nThrough it all, however, nagging questions remained. Why did Nix tell Parliament in February that Cambridge had not obtained or used bulk Facebook data when the evidence showed his company had done exactly that? Was it true that Cambridge, as Wylie told U.K. and U.S. lawmakers, had pitched Lukoil, the Russian energy conglomerate deeply tied to the Kremlin? What exactly did Cambridge do in connection with the 2016 U.K. Brexit referendum?\n\n\n\nNix offered a less-than-convincing mea culpa for why he'd previously misled Parliament when asked about Cambridge's use of Facebook data. \"It was my firm impression that [MP Damian] Collins' questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the data … so I answered no,\" he said. \"When I read the transcript, it became clear that Mr. Collins was also asking whether we had ever held it. Clearly, the answer should have been yes.\" He brushed aside the connection between Cambridge, Lukoil and the Russian government as \"another one of these ludicrous, ludicrous conspiracy theories\" put forward by Wylie. He disagreed with Wylie's claim that Cambridge played a \"pivotal\" role in the Brexit referendum (the company prepared a detailed fundraising and microtargeting plan for a pro-Leave group, though it denies it did any paid work) as a \"conspiracy theory.\"\n\n\n\nAnd on other still-unexplained subjects, Nix simply refused to talk. An MP pressed him repeatedly about who Cambridge's investors were and the role of the Mercer family in underwriting Cambridge. Still, Nix didn't budge. When the same MP asked about the potential illegality under British law of a U.S. citizen bankrolling a company that worked in U.K. elections, Nix said he couldn't talk about it, citing an ongoing investigation.\n\n\n\nThis exchange, in the end, may have been the most revealing of Nix's responses. Back in March, two days after Cambridge's data-harvesting scandal broke, two of Robert Mercer's daughters were quietly made directors of a hitherto unknown British company named Emerdata Limited. The other directors included Nix, two senior-level Cambridge executives, and a Hong Kong businessman tied to Trump ally and war-contractor Erik Prince. Was Emerdata a Plan B for Nix and his colleagues?\n\n\n\nThat idea was shot down by the founder of Cambridge's parent company. But Nix's steadfast refusal to divulge even the slightest information about his big-money backers suggests that he still has a relationship with funders that he wants to keep intact. If that's the case, then it's a fair bet that we haven't heard the last of Nix.",

    "article_text": "LONDON—British law enforcement officials vowed to continue their pursuit of Cambridge Analytica via criminal probes into individual members of staff after the company sent its remaining employees home and reportedly told them the company would be liquidated on Tuesday.\n\nShuttering the company makes it impossible for the Information Commissioners’ Office (ICO) to impose financial sanctions on Cambridge Analytica—or individuals who worked for the political consultancy—but investigators will still be able to pursue criminal proceedings. An official at the ICO said their investigation would press ahead undeterred.\n\n“Even after today’s announcement, the investigation is very much continuing,” an ICO official told The Daily Beast. “If there were any criminal offences… they would follow any individuals wherever they went.”\n\nCambridge Analytica, which worked for the Trump presidential campaign in 2016, was forced into legal and financial jeopardy after the emergence of a whistle-blower. Christopher Wylie claimed the consultancy had misused Facebook data from 87 million people for its political campaigns, which could be bolstered—according to secretly recorded boasts from its former CEO—by nefarious tactics including bribery, espionage, and honeytraps.\n\nAfter filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings in the Southern District of New York last week, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that 40 members of staff were told that no credible buyer was willing to rescue the beleaguered company. As a result, administrators sent the staffers home, saying the company would be liquidated to pay off creditors.\n\nCambridge Analytica was established as a political offshoot of the long-standing British company SCL, which specialized in military influence operations. Steve Bannon, the former White House adviser, and Rebekah Mercer, the daughter of Robert Mercer, former co-CEO of America’s most lucrative hedge fund, were on the board of the company, which succeeded in making its American political breakthrough with the Trump campaign.\n\nAn associate of Mercer initially said she was standing by Cambridge Analytica when the secretly recorded footage emerged. The buffoonish former Eton schoolboy, Alexander Nix, who had been caught on tape, was fired, but company executives subsequently admitted that the reputational damage was too great for the company to continue.\n\nThere was speculation that the Cambridge Analytica operation would be revived under the new name Emerdata, a company that was established in London last summer. According to the bankruptcy filing in New York, Emerdata had an 89.5 percent direct ownership interest in Cambridge Analytica. Emerdata also paid the legal fees for the bankruptcy filing. But Nigel Oakes, the founder of SCL, announced this month that Emerdata would also be shut down.\n\n“The whole lot is gone. There’s no secret,” he told Bloomberg. “It’s the end of the show.”\n\nBritish and American authorities, however, are determined that the show will go on. Wylie has said he is cooperating with investigations by the National Crime Agency in Britain as well as the Department of Justice and the FBI in the U.S.\n\nThe American investigation is reportedly focused on financial dealings and how the company acquired and used data from Facebook. Simultaneous investigations in London are being carried out by the National Crime Agency and the Information Commissioners’ Office, which is in possession of the computers and servers from the company’s London HQ. “We will carry on examining them,” an ICO official said, explaining that any evidence of criminal behavior or wrongdoing would be shared with relevant law enforcement bodies.",

He has not yet responded to the allegations.\n\n© Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited Mr Nix, a polo loving millionaire (pictured centre), was suspended from the company and has not commented on allegations about the $8million loan\n\nMr Nix faced a worldwide media storm in March after he was secretly filmed appearing to suggest the firm use 'beautiful' Ukrainian sex workers to seduce politicians as part of its lucrative election work.\n\nHe was also recorded boasting about the firm's work during the Donald Trump presidential campaign, saying: 'We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.'\n\nNix said its data on voters wins elections and his company made huge sums working with politicians around the globe.\n\nThere were calls for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to resign and he saw £5.3billion wiped off his £48billion personal fortune yesterday due to a plunge in the social media company's share price.\n\n© Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited Mr Nix has been summoned to Parliament \"clarify his original evidence\" after he declined to turn up in April\n\nSince then Zuckerberg has been forced to apologise and try to rebuild trust with users about the safety of their data.\n\nAlexander Nix is at Parliament today and has been recalled to give evidence to an inquiry into fake news. The businessman first appeared before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee in February.\n\nWeeks later CA was suspended by Facebook amid allegations it amassed data on millions of voters from their profiles and misused it.\n\nAmong the allegations were claims the information was used to target voters during Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign, while a whistleblower has claimed the firm had links to pro-Brexit campaigners.\n\n© Provided by Associated Newspapers Limited Mark Zuckerberg's fortune and reputation have been badly damaged by the scandal, pictured facing Congress where he issued a humbling apology\n\nOn Monday, the head of Britain's data watchdog said she was 'deeply concerned' about the impact on democracy of the misuse of social media users' personal information.\n\nThe committee first recalled Mr Nix to appear before them on April 18 to 'clarify his original evidence'.

Former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was testifying before the latter committee at the time this post was published Wednesday. “I wasn’t aware of that,” he told the committee of Kaiser’s reported meeting. “She certainly wasn’t there representing Cambridge Analytica and SCL.”\n\nLucy Dargahi, a spokesperson for the British committee, pointed TPM to Kaiser and Nix’s previous testimony before the panel, but neither confirmed nor denied the Guardian’s reporting that the committee had been given information about a post-election meeting or cryptocurrency payments. Spokespeople for Senate Judiciary Committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe Guardian cited Ecuadorian Embassy visitor logs that it and the Ecuadorian publication Focus Ecuador had obtained showing Kaiser’s visit on Feb. 17 of last year. “Information passed on” to the British and American committees, the paper reported, “states that the meeting was ‘a retrospective to discuss the US election.’”\n\nCiting “reports passed to investigators,” the Guardian also reported that Kaiser said she’d funneled cryptocurrency “gifts and payments” from third parties to Wikileaks, which she reportedly called her “favourite charity.”\n\nCambridge Analytica’s CEO reached out to Wikileaks during the 2016 campaign offering to help sort through emails stolen from Hillary Clinton’s campaign, but both Nix and Assange have said that Assange didn’t take him up on the offer.\n\nThe Guardian noted Wednesday that in testimony before the British committee in April, Kaiser said she’d wondered why Nix would have attempted to reach Wikileaks through an email address associated with a speaking agency representing the group, given her existing relationship with a friend and lawyer of Assange’s, the late John Jones.\n\n“That’s what I was wondering when I found that out from the press – he could have asked me to put him in touch with the legal team,” she said. “But he didn’t.”\n\n“I knew she had a relationship with John Jones,” Nix told the committee Wednesday.\n\nAgain citing “information passed to the US and UK committees,” the Guardian reported that a former legal assistant to Jones, Robert Murtfeld, subsequently worked for Cambridge Analytica and arranged Kaiser’s February 2017 meeting with Assange.\n\nCambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Elections, ceased operations last month following intense scrutiny over its use of Facebook user data.

    "article_text": "Illustration: Angelica Alzona/Gizmodo\n\nSitting with a friend in a bar in mid-March, a former Cambridge Analytica employee said he was having a beer when someone texted him Facebook’s announcement that it was kicking the data firm off its platform “pending further information.” “I just remember thinking, ‘Oh my God,’” he told Gizmodo. “This is going to be insane.”\n\n“I was like, ‘Man, what am I going to do?’” the former employee continued. “I won’t say the writing was on the wall, I didn’t necessarily think that was going to be the death of us.”\n\nThe social network’s abrupt announcement came just a day before explosive reports from The New York Times and The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from millions of Facebook users without their consent. The firm was accused of misusing that data to help the Trump campaign target voters, but it denied any wrongdoing, alleging that it deleted the Facebook data once it learned it was obtained illegitimately.\n\nLast week, both Cambridge Analytica and its parent company SCL Group shut down their offices. Cambridge Analytica announced in a press release that it, along with SCL Elections and other affiliate companies, had filed for insolvency in the U.K. with bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. soon to follow. Gizmodo spoke with two former Cambridge Analytica employees as well as a source with direct knowledge of the company’s final days, all of whom requested anonymity to speak freely about internal company matters.\n\nAccording to one former employee, Cambridge Analytica’s leaders informed the company that negative news was imminent before the Guardian and Times stories broke, but few could have predicted how quickly it would lead to the firm’s complete collapse. Cambridge Analytica had already faced damaging coverage—like when Julian Assange confirmed last fall that the data firm had reached out to WikiLeaks—so some may have anticipated that the Facebook news would be just another bump in the road.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJust a few days after those initial reports, however, the U.K.’s Channel 4 released a damning video showing Cambridge Analytica’s then-CEO Alexander Nix proposing tactics to a potential client that included entrapment and blackmail. Even then, one former employee believed that while the video of Nix would be “extremely harmful,” it was nothing that a change of leadership couldn’t remedy, saying now, “No one had any idea that it would spiral out of control.”\n\nUntil the very end, Cambridge Analytica’s workers believed that the company was a collection of good, talented people simply entangled in a web of bad press, mismanagement, and guilt by political association. While speaking to Gizmodo, former employees disputed that Cambridge Analytica directly used Facebook data in its work on the 2016 election, seemingly viewing this relatively minor point of contention as the crux of the entire scandal—and framing the company’s downfall not as a reckoning for past sins, but the result of being unable to get its message across.\n\nWhile there were clear signs that this time was different—with Cambridge Analytica’s leadership postponing major decisions and scheduling multiple board meetings—employees believed the company was financially sound enough to continue into the immediate future. “I knew that we weren’t long for this world,” said one former employee, “but I didn’t think it would happen as fast as it did.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen, late last month, employees braced for the worst as a company-wide “town hall” was scheduled for April 30, and then rescheduled for May 1, before getting pushed back on May 2 every half-hour from 10am to 12:30pm. Ultimately, the meeting was rescheduled more than half a dozen times. While waiting for it to begin, employees adopted a gallows humor in the company Slack. One shared a screenshot from the movie Titanic in the internal chat service and another posted Spotify playlists titled “Hammer to Fall” and “End of Days” featuring songs like “The End” by The Doors, “Help!” by The Beatles, and (perhaps tellingly) “It Wasn’t Me” by Shaggy.\n\nIn the end, the announcement was even graver than might be anticipated. Julian Wheatland, chair of parent company SCL Group, explained that Cambridge Analytica and its affiliate companies were shutting down. A brief moment of levity came when someone calling into the meeting played a snippet of a cheerful song that starkly contrasted with the grim tone of the call. Less than two months after Facebook’s announcement landed, all of Cambridge Analytica’s employees were packing up their desks and turning over their laptops and keycards.\n\nSCL Group did not immediately respond to our request for comment. Cambridge Analytica was not available for comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the data firm’s collapse, many speculated that the company would be resurrected under the names of two other companies: Emerdata and Firecrest Technologies, Limited. Emerdata was set up last August—six months before the Facebook scandal errupted—and has a number of Cambridge Analytica executives attached to it, including conservative heiresses Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, former Chief Data Officer Alexander Tayler, and SCL Group’s Wheatland. Firecrest Technologies, an Emerdata subsidiary, was incorporated in March of this year, with Tayler brought on as a director.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, however, SCL Group founder Nigel Oakes pushed back against speculation that Emerdata and Firecrest would be revived as a Cambridge Analytica 2.0, saying both were winding down. “It’s the end of the show,” Oakes told Bloomberg on Tuesday. “The whole lot is gone. There’s no secret. For anything like this to recreate itself, you need a team of people to work together but nobody is working together. Everybody has gone off to do their own things.”\n\nFormer Cambridge Analytica employees echoed this sentiment, believing Emerdata to be nothing more than a holding company created in a restructuring attempt, and that without a number of key players, it would be doomed to fail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We were the ones that did all the work,” one said. “Leadership just picking up and going to a new entity, it wouldn’t matter. They can’t do the work.” Another former employee noted that Wheatland was on the business side, meaning he likely didn’t hold any intellectual property. And while Tayler certainly did, the former employee said he was “very dependent on his staff.”\n\n“He doesn’t necessarily have the global ambitions that Alexander Nix and some people had,” said the source. “I am sure he is going to do something else along these lines but not recreate exactly what was done.”\n\nProud of the work they did for Cambridge Analytica, former employees offered different explanations for what ultimately killed the company, but none seemed to believe that their work was an abuse of the public trust—at least not any more invasive than existing companies brokering data. One cited Facebook’s rush to name the firm as deeply damaging, saying that the social network knew the news was coming “and wanted to protect their interest.” Another specifically blamed Nix’s personal arrogance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The more that it sinks in, the more angry I am at the recklessness of Nix and his method of selling and sell-at-all-costs and overhype,” said a former employee. “That really did us in. I mean really that did us in more than Trump.” The source claimed that when Nix was pitching to clients, he kept the fact that Cambridge Analytica used Facebook data to develop personality models in his presentation, even though the company had long stopped using that data, “because he liked how it sold.”\n\nEven if Cambridge Analytica is truly dead, there are still plenty of reasons to be kept up at night. The former employees who spoke to Gizmodo seemed to believe that the firm wasn’t a rogue actor, but rather a somewhat typical member of their industry caught in a media firestorm. While certainly a self-serving assessment, incidents like last year’s Equifax breach demonstrate how much of our data is out there—and how easily it can fall into unintended hands. When another shadowy data broker is revealed to have violated the public’s trust, workers at that company will likely be wondering why everyone’s picking on them.\n\nIf you are a current or former data brokerage firm employee with information about misused data, you can email me at melanie.ehrenkranz@gizmodo.com.

    "article_text": "On Wednesday, Julian Wheatland, the new CEO of the much-maligned Cambridge Analytica, told employees that both Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, SCL Group, were shutting down for good. One of the primary reasons Wheatland cited, according to Gizmodo, was that any attempt to rebrand the company in the face of its massive data harvesting scandal was “futile.”\n\nThat may be true for the employees, but it doesn’t appear to apply to Cambridge Analytica’s higher-ups.\n\nRebekah Mercer — who, along with her father, served as Cambridge Analytica’s main source of funding — joined the board of a new company called Emerdata, NBC reported Wednesday.\n\nMuch like Cambridge Analytica, which is facing scrutiny from British and American governments for its role in swiping data from tens of millions of unsuspecting Facebook users, Emerdata appears to be a data harvesting company. Rebekah’s sister Jennifer also joined her on Emerdata’s board.\n\nEven more evidence of the proximity between Emerdata and Cambridge Analytica, which helped U.S. President Donald Trump to victory in 2016: Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica’s ex-CEO, had planned on directing the new company, according to NBC.\n\nNix was named a director of Emerdata in February, before the Facebook scandal broke — but was terminated on April 13, according to a British government filing. That same day, Alexander Tayler, the former chief data officer at Cambridge Analytica, was named a director of Emerdata… In a British government filing declaring her new role as director at Emerdata, Rebekah Mercer listed her correspondence address as 597 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan — Cambridge Analytica’s New York office.\n\nIn March, Business Insider described Emerdata’s goals as “mysterious,” noting that it had only been incorporated in August 2017, and that it listed its address as the same location as the SCL Group.\n\nWhile little is known about Emerdata, company filing information revealed four other directors alongside the Mercer sisters. And the COO? None other than Wheatland, who listed his address as the same as Emerdata’s — and the same as the SCL Group’s.",

    "article_text": "The founders and funders of controversial election consultants Cambridge Analytica are behind a new company registered in London appearing to offer similar services.\n\nExecutives at Cambridge Analytica (CA) and parent company SCL Group registered Emerdata Limited as a data processing company last summer but they have since listed directors linked to private military contractors, secretive political meetings and the Trump administration.\n\nRebekah and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of the billionaire Robert Mercer who funded Cambridge Analytica, its parent company SCL Group and Donald Trump’s election campaign, were officially registered as directors of the company on Tuesday, the same day CA chief executive Alexander Nix was suspended from his role for comments made to journalists posing as prospective clients.\n\nChannel 4 News broadcast footage on Monday which showed Mr Nix discussing entrapment, disinformation tactics and “fake IDs and websites” to influence elections.\n\nMr Nix and Julian Wheatland, the chairman of SCL Group, are listed as directors of Emerdata.\n\nCompanies House records show Mr Wheatland registered Emerdata last August, alongside CA’s chief data officer Alexander Tayler. Dr Tayler has since left the board of Emerdata but was appointed chief executive of Cambridge Analytica in Nix’s place.\n\nCambridge Analytica is at the centre of a row over their use of Facebook data, accused of harvesting personal information from more than 50 million accounts and using it to target them with political advertising which plays on their hopes and fears.\n\n“If you’re collecting data on people and you’re profiling them, that gives you more insight that you can use to know how to segment the population, to give them messaging about issues that they care about, and language and imagery that they’re likely to engage with,” Dr Tayler said about his work at CA, in footage secretly filmed by Channel 4 News.\n\nAdvertising\n\n“We used that in America and we used that in Africa. That’s what we do as a company.”\n\nAlso named as a director of Emerdata is 66-year-old Hong Kong businessman Johnson Chun Shun Ko, a close associate of Erik Prince, founder of private military contractor Blackwater, which secured hundreds of millions in government contracts for private military operations during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nMr Ko serves as deputy chairman for Frontier Services Group Limited, a company which describes itself as a “Africa-focused security, aviation and logistics company” and is led by Mr Prince, its chairman.\n\nMr Prince is the brother of Donald Trump’s secretary of education Betsy DeVos, and is alleged to have met an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin in the Seychelles in January 2017, nine days before the Mr Trump’s inauguration. The Washington Post described the meeting as “an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication” between Moscow and the then president-elect.\n\nAdvertising\n\nMr Prince and the White House deny he was representing the Trump transition team in any way. Mr Prince described the meeting as a chance encounter that had nothing to do with the president.\n\nTwo other directors with apparent links to the UK were also listed.\n\nOne, 29-year-old Ahmad Al-Khatib, was described as a citizen of the Seychelles living in England, who joined the company at the same time as Mr Ko.\n\nThe other was a 30-year-old woman with British citizenship living in Hong Kong called Cheng Peng.\n\nLittle is known about either Mr Al-Khatib’s or Ms Peng’s role or background.\n\nMr Nix, Mr Ko, Mr Al-Khatib and Ms Peng were all appointed directors of the company on January 23 2018. Companies House records also show there was an allotment of shares to the value of almost £2 million on the same day.\n\nMr Wheatland and Dr Tayler ceased to be people “with significant control” on January 23, according to Companies House, although Mr Wheatland remains a director.\n\nThe company has been incorporated at two separate addresses: initially, at the offices of a law firm in central London and later an accountancy firm in Canary Wharf.",

both list accountancy firm PKF Littlejohn's Canary Wharf office as their registered address.\n\nHowever, the woman who answered the phone at PKF Littlejohn said that it was \"not prepared to make any comment\" on the matter.\n\nPKF Littlejohn's office is also listed as SCL Group's contact address.\n\nA spokesman for Cambridge Analytica did not respond to a request to clarify if there is a relationship between the companies\n\nBoth Channel 4 News and the New York Times have reported that Nigel Oakes, a British director of the SCL Group, has said that Emerdata was set up to acquire and roll together Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group under a new name.\n\nBillionaire family\n\nEmerdata has no website, but its listing on Companies House says it is engaged in \"data processing, hosting and related activities\".\n\nThe firm's records reveal the nine-month-old business became involved in a flurry of activity in the days surrounding the Observer newspaper's expose of the Facebook data harvest, and Channel 4 screening a hidden camera video showing Cambridge Analytica chief Alexander Nix discussing potential ways to discredit politicians.\n\nThis activity included the appointment of Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer as directors.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Rebekah Mercer is the second-born of Robert Mercer's three daughters\n\nThe two women are daughters of the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who is reported to have been one of Cambridge Analytica's major investors.\n\nAnd the contact address given for Rebekah Mercer is the same location as Cambridge Analytica's New York operation.\n\nNeither of the sisters had been directors of Cambridge Analytica or other SCL Group businesses before.\n\nIn addition, Mr Nix - who had been one of Emerdata's directors - had his post terminated.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Cambridge Analytica had said that it was carrying out an investigation into its former chief Alexander Nix\n\nHe was replaced by Cambridge Analytica's chief data officer and acting chief executive, Dr Alexander Bruce Tayler.\n\nA New-York based investigative journalist has tracked other alleged links between SCL and Emerdata.\n\nWendy Siegelman told the BBC that she was particularly intrigued by Emerdata's appointment of the Chinese businessman Johnson Chun Shun Ko as one of its directors in January.\n\nMr Ko had not previously been a director of either Cambridge Analytica or the SCL Group.\n\n\"He has a business partnership with Erik Prince, who plays a key role in the Trump-Russia investigation,\" she said.\n\n\"And [President Trump's former chief strategist] Steve Bannon has reportedly been a very close associate of Mr Prince.\"\n\nMr Bannon co-founded Cambridge Analytica and recently said he had coined its name.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Steve Bannon was a close associate of the Mercer family before he criticised President Trump\n\n\"I wonder if Bannon is still operating in the background even though he's not a director,\" added Ms Siegelman.\n\nFirecrest describes itself as a \"business and domestic software\" developer.\n\nIt was only created on 7 March, while the Observer newspaper report was still being prepared.\n\nSomewhat bizarrely, Alexander Nix was appointed and then stood down as its director the same day\n\nDr Tayler has been in charge ever since.\n\nBankruptcy law\n\nEven if Emerdata and Firecrest are intended to carry out similar work to Cambridge Analytica, UK insolvency law prevents them simply walking away with its data.\n\n\"All the assets are now under the control of the administrator, so the directors no longer have any powers to do anything,\" said Nick Hood, a consultant to the insolvency specialist Opus Restructuring.\n\n\"In a high-profile case like this, the administrator would look at the intellectual property of the firm, consider how best to market it and might well talk to the people who used to run Cambridge Analytica to see if they are prepared to pay a reasonable market price for those assets.\n\n\"But no insolvency practitioner would simply allow the assets to be taken, as he would be for the high jump.\"\n\nMr Hood added that any sale would leave a paper trail stating who the new owner or owners were.\n\n\"It's a very transparent process,\" he said.\n\nThe Information Commissioners Office has already made it clear that it intends to keep track of what happens next, as part of its investigation into the use of personal data by political campaigns.\n\n\"The ICO will continue its civil and criminal investigations and will seek to pursue individuals and directors, as appropriate and necessary even where companies may no longer be operating,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing and claims an \"independent investigation\", carried out at its request, failed to find evidence to support the allegations made against it.\n\nHowever, others -

    "article_text": "The company formerly known as Cambridge Analytica shocked the media today when it announced an immediate shutdown and liquidation of its business.\n\nThat \"shutdown,\" however, may be short-lived as official documents indicate those behind the controversial analytics company will be launching as a new firm with a less-toxic brand.\n\nThe surprise announcement came on Wednesday evening, when the UK-based Cambridge Anal., and its parent organization SCL Elections, stated it would enter insolvency proceedings and disband immediately.\n\n$0.75 – about how much Cambridge Analytica paid per voter in bid to micro-target their minds, internal docs reveal READ MORE\n\nThe announcement came after Cambridge Anal. found itself at the center of a political firestorm when a former staffer blew the whistle on a data-harvesting campaign that had covertly collected the personal information on more than 87 million Facebook users.\n\nThese records were used to target particular voters with ads and social media posts in hope of influencing their decisions at the ballot box. Whether or not these persuasion tactics actually worked is up for debate, but an attempt was at least made with info sneakily swiped from people's profiles via a quiz app. The biz denies any wrongdoing.\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\" the biz said in its blame-shifting sign-off.\n\n\"Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, which view is now fully supported by [Queen's Counsel Julian] Malins’ report, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers.\"\n\nThe organization said it will honor all employee severance, notice, and redundancy obligations as the lights go out. It added:\n\nThe company is immediately ceasing all operations and the boards have applied to appoint insolvency practitioners Crowe Clark Whitehill LLP to act as the independent administrator for Cambridge Analytica. Additionally, parallel bankruptcy proceedings will soon be commenced on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC and certain of the company’s US affiliates in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.\n\nThough Cambridge Analytica said it is pulling the plug in the US and UK, there is already some indication that the outfit – which has a non-trivial organizational structure – is more or less just going to rebrand under a different banner.\n\nThe UK's official registrar of businesses and organizations, Companies House, lists an active company called Emerdata Limited, headquartered at the same offices as SCL Elections and run by much of the same management and investors as Cambridge Analytica. It even describes itself as a \"data processing, hosting and related activities\" organization.\n\nFor instance, Dr Alexander Taylor was appointed a director of Emerdata on March 28. That's Cambridge Analytica's acting CEO and data wizard Dr Alexander Taylor. Julian Wheatland is an Emerdata director who is also a director within the SCL network of organizations.\n\nJennifer and Rebekah Mercer are directors of Emerdata, and are the daughters of ultra-wealthy businessman Robert Mercer who created and bankrolled Cambridge Analytica. Billionaire Bob has given tens of millions of dollars to rightwing political efforts. Jennifer and Rebekah also had a hand in Cambridge Anal.\n\nEmerdata was founded in mid-2017, but has been rather active since Cambridge Analytica hit the headlines earlier this year, including official filings as recent as yesterday.\n\nSo, it seems the shutdown may be less a business catastrophe than a marketing exercise. ®\n\nSponsored: Minds Mastering Machines - Call for papers now open",

A spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt isn't clear what Emerdata does, though the company is listed under \"data processing, hosting, and related activities.\" It shares an address in Canary Wharf with Cambridge Analytica's parent, SCL Group.\n\nEmerdata is connected to controversial Trump supporter Erik Prince\n\nAnother notable company director is Johnson Chun Shun Ko, the deputy chairman of Frontier Services Group.\n\nFrontier is a private security firm which mostly operates in Africa and is currently chaired by US businessman and prominent Trump supporter Erik Prince.

Communications firms Cambridge Analytica has offices in London, New York, Washington, as well as Brazil and Malaysia. The company boasts it can 'find your voters and move them to action' through data-driven campaigns and a team that includes data scientists and behavioural psychologists. 'Within the United States alone, we have played a pivotal role in winning presidential races as well as congressional and state elections,' with data on more than 230 million American voters, Cambridge Analytica claims on its website. The company profited from a feature that meant apps could ask for permission to access your own data as well as the data of all your Facebook friends. The data firm suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix (pictured), after recordings emerged of him making a series of controversial claims, including boasts that Cambridge Analytica had a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump This meant the company was able to mine the information of 87 million Facebook users even though just 270,000 people gave them permission to do so. This was designed to help them create software that can predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box. The data firm suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after recordings emerged of him making a series of controversial claims, including boasts that Cambridge Analytica had a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump. This information is said to have been used to help the Brexit campaign in the UK.\n\nAll entities have the same London address - the offices of PKF Littlejohn based in Canary Wharf.\n\nOn Wednesday, executive and part owner of SCL Group - which formed Cambridge Analytica - described Emerdata as a way of combing the two companies under a single banner, reported New York Times.\n\nTwo more of the firm's directors are Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer.\n\nThey are daughters of hedge fund billionaire and prominent Donald Trump supporter Robert Mercer, who is also reported to be a major investor in Cambridge Analytica.\n\nRebekah Mercer's New York contact address is the same as Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCambridge Analytica issued a statement saying it was starting bankruptcy proceedings due to a 'seige of media coverage'. However, it seems the scandal-hit company might not be going as quiet as previously thought. Pictured is the company's empty Washington office\n\n'It's like the hydra beast of Greek mythology — you cut one head off and another one grows,' Damian Collins, chair of the UK parliamentary select committee for digital, culture, media and sport said, writes the FT.\n\n'I think it will be business as usual for Cambridge Analytica but under a different name', he said.\n\nLast week a Cambridge Analytica spokesperson did not deny the companies were linked.\n\n'Many international corporates have different divisions and different arms for different types of the business,' he said.\n\nWhen asked if Cambridge Analytica would reformulate, the spokesperson said: 'That is a business decision, the [Cambridge Analytica] company board in due course will assess the findings of the independent investigation and will take any relevant decisions then.'",

    "article_text": "Cambridge Analytica’s parent company gathered data for Western spy agencies to single out men with jihadist sentiments as a part of “counter-insurgency” operation, journalist Max Blumenthal told RT.\n\nWhile the Cambridge Analytica scandal is still making waves, it has emerged that its parent company, Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), conducted research for foreign intelligence in Yemen in 2009 under its Project Titania. Hired staffers were tasked with making a psychological portrait of “young males who are deemed susceptible for jihadist activity,” Blumenthal said in an interview to RT.\n\nThe journalist legally obtained the documents and leaked them, exposing the details of the operation.\n\nRead more\n\n“Basically, [the leaked docs] show a counter-insurgency operation where staffers from SCL and a US private intelligence agency called Archimedes enter Yemen through the British embassy and then start partnering with local researchers… [They] conduct research on young males who are deemed susceptible for jihadist activity,” Blumenthal told RT.\n\nThe findings were then presented to “whoever their patron was, apparently the British... looks like MI6,” according to the journalist. The British intelligence agency was apparently not alone in resorting to the help of SCL group, further investigation shows. In 2017, the US State Department handed out two “lucrative contracts” to SCL “to carry out what they considered to be a counter-propaganda operation.”\n\nThis was also confirmed by US State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert. In March, she said that the Global Engagement Center started cooperating with SCL “in a very specific way to interview people who we thought were at risk as a part of our way of retraining people’s minds or getting people to not jump into terrorism” in 2016. She also pointed the finger at the UK as one of the other governments doing the same thing.\n\n“As secretive as MI6 or the CIA can be, it’s often more convenient to turn to private intelligence agencies and outsource your intelligence collection… as well as your influence operations. It’s how the SCL group marketed itself to intelligence agencies and government groups around the world,” Blumenthal said.\n\nThe spy agencies are aware that there are plenty of unknown private intelligence firms operating beyond a legal framework. The problem is that they have no accountability for the results of their actions as they can bring instability to a conflict zone where they are operating, according to Blumenthal.\n\n“There is a gigantic web of firms whose names we don’t know, who are operating in the darkness by definition and they are contracted by the governments to not only spy... but to export those methods back to our electoral systems in the West.”\n\nLike this story?

    "article_text": "Cambridge Analytica, the Trump-aligned data firm which was found to have improperly harvested personal data from 87 million Facebook users, and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon worked to suppress the black vote in the 2016 election, a former employee told Congress on Wednesday.\n\nChristopher Wylie, an ex-employee of Cambridge Analytica who blew the whistle on the company's misuse of Facebook, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the company offered strategies to discourage certain segments of the population from voting. He said that Bannon, who was CEO of the firm at the time, directed those efforts.\n\n\"Mr. Bannon sees cultural warfare as the means to create enduring change in American politics. It was for this reason Mr. Bannon engaged SCL (Cambridge Analytica's parent company), a foreign military contractor, to build an arsenal of informational weapons he could deploy on the American population,\" said Wylie.\n\nAsked by Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) if one of Bannon's \"goals was to suppress voting or discourage certain individuals in the US from voting,\" Wylie replied, \"That was my understanding, yes.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN Wednesday night, Wylie said that Cambridge Analytica offered services to \"discourage or demobilize certain types of people from voting\" and that African-Americans were targets of those \"voter disengagement strategies.\"\n\nWylie added that campaigns and political action committees had requested voter-suppression services from the firm, although he didn't say which ones. He said he did not personally work on voter disengagement.\n\nEarlier this month, Cambridge Analytica announced it was shutting down in the US and UK. The company was primarily funded by Republican megadonor Steve Bannon and his daughter Rebekah, who sat on the company's board. Earlier this year, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix was caught on hidden camera by the UK's Channel 4 boasting of using entrapment and extortion to compromise political candidates.\n\nIn March, a new company called Emerdata was registered with the UK's Companies House. Several Cambridge Analytica backers and executives were listed as officers of the company, including Nix and Rebekah Mercer.",

    "article_text": "Video: A violation of trust: Where Facebook and Cambridge Analytica went wrong\n\nWhen salacious tales of Cambridge Analytica's activities emerged in 2018, we thought the company was finished. The many on-air discussions of illegal activities, law enforcement warrants, legal action threats from partners, and questionable ethics had appeared to doom them. We then saw multiple suspensions and resignations, and on May 2, 2018 Cambridge Analytica announced it would file for bankruptcy. For a brief moment, it seemed like the world was a better place: The \"good team\" had won, the evil doers were vanquished, and the world was moving on.\n\nRead also: Facebook: Cambridge Analytica took a lot more data than first thought\n\nOf course, this wasn't actually the case. Instead...\n\n21ST CENTURY MONSTERS ARE FILING PAPERWORK AS CORPORATIONS\n\nThe victory celebration was short-lived. On the heels of the bankruptcy news, we learned that Emerdata -- a company founded in 2017 -- was using the same address as Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL. So, in continuing proof that we might be living in the darkest timeline possible, Emerdata is listing the chairman of Frontier Services Group as one of its directors, and his lineage dates back to Blackwater. Is this a nod to the rebranding efforts of the infamous private security firm? Does Emerdata want you to forget about its evil past? Most definitely yes. Not only is Cambridge Analytica rising from the dead (like a zombie), it's rising with enhanced predator capabilities (like a vampire). A vampire with legal paperwork and tax documentation prepared and filed, that is.\n\nWE'RE WITNESSING THE DANGER OF THE SCARY DATA LIFECYCLE\n\nWhen you collect data, and then build platforms and business models that monetize that data, you risk losing control of the data. Companies might use that information for good, perhaps making medical advances, and other companies might use it for evil. To make this as clear as possible -- no matter how much evil Cambridge Analytica did with the data it obtained from Facebook, Facebook is in way more trouble. We outline the dangers of the scary data lifecycle in our Future of Cybersecurity and Privacy research.\n\nRead also: The CIAM implications of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal\n\nIf you're actively monetizing information, you could be the next Facebook. Your digital supply chain is now loaded with ethical and moral dilemmas you will need to confront sooner rather than later. Cambridge Analytica is simply rebranding and emerging as something \"different.\" In fact, the asymmetry between the firms is striking. Facebook can't simply rebrand or change in a few days. Yet the company that helped to make them public enemy No. 1 in 2018 has pulled a disappearing act while eyes were focused in the other direction. Is it worth becoming the next data distributor only to be crushed by your third-party's ethics?\n\nWEAPONIZING DATA COMBINED WITH PARAMILITARY EXPERTISE SHOULD CONCERN... EVERYONE\n\nCambridge Analytica -- Emerdata, SCL Group -- has already proven its willingness to engage in destabilizing behavior aimed at governments. It turns out that weaponizing data is an effective way to influence elections on a global basis. (Are you scared yet?) Now in a government-esque move, Emerdata has coupled its background of destabilizing data analytics with para-military expertise. Regardless of political affiliation or viewpoint, this should concern governments and enterprises as one of the more terrifying geopolitical threats.\n\nWEAPONIZED DATA WILL TARGET YOUR BRAND\n\nWhile the group of clients Cambridge Analytica represents featured politicians and political movements, enterprises should worry about what will happen when influence campaigns take aim at their brand and reputation. It will be more than a PR and advertising battle. Disinformation, misinformation, and feedback loops designed to elicit the most emotional responses possible will seek to degrade -- or distort -= the customer experiences and customer engagements that your business has created.\n\nRead also: How to tell if Cambridge Analytica accessed your Facebook data\n\n--By Jeff Pollard, Principal Analyst\n\nFor more on that topic, attend my session titled: \"Defending Your Brand In The Post Truth Era\" at Digital Transformation 2018 on May 8, 2018 in Chicago.",

The company was able to amass the database quickly with the help of an app that appeared to be a personality test.\n\nThe app collected data on tens of millions of people and their Facebook friends — even those who did not download the app themselves.\n\nCommittee members are exploring how Google manages the data it collects, questioning McKay on the company's ability to track users' locations and broader issues of government oversight.\n\nThe Google executive rejected claims from Balsillie and MPs that Google sells users' personal information and denounced Balsillie's recommendations as overly prescriptive.\n\n\"Creating a strategy that tries to box Canada in or tries to create obligations that are not either parallel or similar to those available elsewhere in the world will actually limit the opportunities available to Canadians to innovate both in Canada and internationally,\" McKay said.\n\nCompanies could destroy data\n\nU.K. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, who testified before the committee prior to McKay and Balsillie taking the stage, cautioned that the powers held by Canada's information and privacy commissioner to investigate data breaches have fallen behind the rest of the world — especially given the exponential growth of tech companies.\n\n\"Even the powers that I have under the current U.K. data protection act weren't sufficient in this case, and government has moved really quickly and tabled amendments, which were passed last night, to provide us with even more powers,\" Denham said.\n\nUK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham says that Canada's Information and Privacy Commissioner's powers have fallen behind the rest of the world, especially in a world of digital companies. 1:35\n\nCambridge Analytica filed for bankruptcy last month, sparking concerns over the risk that it might destroy important data and compromise the investigation.\n\nThe U.K. warrant to investigate Cambridge Analytica took seven days to authorize — a long turnaround time that gave the company an opportunity to reorganize, Ontario Liberal MP Raj Saini said.\n\nCambridge Analytica employees have launched new organizations — Emerdata and Firecrest — as a way to evade official probes, Saini said.\n\n\"It seems like the same actors are trying to realign themselves,\" Saini said.\n\n\"If you move the physical assets of a company somewhere else, there's some accountability because you can see a desk being moved. You can see machinery being moved. But you're talking about data now, and data can be moved very quickly.\"\n\nWhile the U.K. government has managed to secure data from Cambridge Analytica, Denham said that, in a digital world, information could be erased in the time that it takes to secure a warrant.\n\n\"The current provisions in our law don't allow us to be able to move quickly with a warrant,\" Denham said.\n\n\"We need to be able to respond to digital crimes.\"",

    "article_text": "Editor’s Note: This is the second installment of a two-part investigation into Cambridge Analytica/SCL’s global operations. Read the first part here.\n\nInternal documents exclusively obtained by the Grayzone Project (and embedded after this article) show how Cambridge Analytica’s UK-based parent company, SCL group, conducted a surveillance operation in Yemen called Project Titania. The initiative relied on psychological profiling, “strategic communications campaigns,” and infiltration of foreign operatives into indigenous communities through unwitting local partners whom they were instructed to deceive.\n\nAccording to the materials detailed here, Project Titania was to be implemented by SCL “on behalf of Archimedes.” Archimedes is a US-based private contractor that advertises its ability to provide “Systems Integration, Engineering, and Mission Support solutions to government and businesses worldwide.”\n\nThe partnership between SCL and Archimedes highlights the seamless web of relationships between private intelligence firms and Western governments engaged in counter-intelligence activities in the Middle East. These large scale surveillance operations have been conducted without the knowledge of the Western public or input from elected officials, and would have remained mostly unknown had a series of leaks and hacking operations not placed them in the public domain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCommunications obtained legally by the Grayzone Project indicated that a former Archimedes staffer named Tim Riesen was a key contact for the Yemen operation. Little information is publicly available about Riesen; he is currently the the CEO of an international corporate consultancy firm called Madison Springfield, Inc.\n\nWhile he is also listed as an adjunct political science professor at the school of graduate studies at Norwich University, a private military academy in Vermont, published material by Riesen is difficult to find online. Riesen did not respond to an interview request delivered by the Grayzone Project to his email at Madison Springfield.\n\nOne of Riesen’s few public appearances consists of a brief cameo in a 2011 video by AFRICOM, the US military command center that operates in 53 African countries. In the video, an AFRICOM staffer describes a briefing Riesen delivered on the demographics and political tendencies of South Sudan ahead of its independence referendum that year.\n\nDespite his negligible online footprint, or perhaps because of it, Riesen has made himself a considerable player in the world of private intelligence. That is clear from the tranche of emails that surfaced when the private intel firm HBGary was hacked in 2010 by the Anonymous collective.\n\nThe HBGary hacks were first reported by journalist Barrett Brown, who was prosecuted by Obama’s Department of Justice and sentenced to five years in prison for publicizing the emails. When their contents were published in full at Wikileaks, HBGary and consortium of intelligence firms were exposed for planning to carry out a full-scale attack on American social justice activists and journalists.\n\nThe firms homed in on journalist Glenn Greenwald and Wikileaks, plotting to undermine both through a campaign of “disinformation,” spawning internal rifts and “creating messages around actions to sabotage or discredit the opposing organization.” HBGary was also considered by the US Chamber of Commerce to launch a smear campaign against its critics.\n\nIn a separate initiative, HBGary aimed to develop a “persona management” system for the US Air Force that enabled users to spam social media with replies from users with false but detailed personas that gave the impression of organic consensus. The project outlined in the emails closely resembles the kind of troll and bot farms that have gained infamy amid America’s furor over Russian meddling, however, this one was made in the USA.\n\nAccording to Barrett Brown, the contract for the system was ultimately won by a subsidiary of Cubic, a major multi-national arms, combat training company, and infrastructure company.\n\nArchimedes and the ROMAS/COIN mass surveillance plan\n\nThough the HBGary emails generated a brief flurry of media interest, little attention was devoted to one of the most disturbing programs they exposed. In a series of communications between intelligence firm directors, an operation came to light that Brown described as “a secretive and immensely sophisticated campaign of mass surveillance and data mining against the Arab world, allowing the intelligence community to monitor the habits, conversations, and activity of millions of individuals at once.”\n\nThat plan was Romas/COIN, with “COIN” referring to counter-intelligence — the same acronym used in the FBI’s notorious COINTELPRO program. Riesen’s Archimedes was a key player in the development of the initiative.\n\nAccording to details of the program gathered by Brown and a collection of online researchers, Apple was also an active team partner, communicating regularly with HBGary CEO Aaron Barr and his peers. In one email, Apple’s “Homeland Defense Manager” Andy Kemp rescheduled a meeting with Barr by explaining, “I’ve been requested to be [in] phoenix by a senior member at ODNI [the Office of the Director of National Intelligence] – someone That I don’t say no to.”\n\nRomas/COIN focused heavily on mobile phone software and applications. Its designers aimed to develop specialized “social media monitoring tools” and linguistic analysis systems, presumably to surveil the communications of younger, activist-minded Arabs on platforms like Facebook.\n\nTo emphasize the Arab-centric nature of Romas/COIN, Chris Clair of the intelligence firm TASC proposed a bold name to his colleagues: “Can we name COIN Saif? Saif is the sword an Arab executioner uses when they decapitate criminals. I can think of a few cool brands for this.”\n\nIn the end, the private spies agreed to call their program “ROMAS.”\n\n“ROMAS is the name of a middle eastern spider. 😉 I thought I was pretty clever,” HBGary’s Barr wrote. “I am glad they are going to continue to use the name.”\n\nRiesen appears in several emails with Clair, Barr, and a handful of partners pursuing what he called a “potential collaboration opportunity.” He described his company, Archimedes, and Barr’s HBGary, as subcontractors to Clair’s TASC on the project.\n\nTogether, they brainstormed a plan to compete with the contractor Northrup Grumman for a lucrative contract from an unnamed US government client seeking advanced capabilities in surveillance and “IO” — the acronym for influence operations.\n\nOn July 23, 2010, the ROMAS/COIN team decided on an informal setting to brainstorm their proposal. “And we are on Thursday,” Clair informed Riesen. I’ll have the steaks ready to grill and the beer will be chilled. I am sure it will be loads of fun.”\n\nMassive State Department contracts to SCL for covert propaganda\n\nIn a recent exchange at the US State Department, spokesperson Heather Nauert confirmed that the US government had provided SCL with lucrative contracts to advance its propaganda goals on the international stage. Nauert acknowledged that in late 2016, the US State Department’s Global Engagement Center was granted a $120 million budget to wage war on online ISIS recruitment and Russian “disinformation.”\n\nThe counter-propaganda initiative promptly doled out two contracts, totaling $496,232, to SCL in February and March of 2017 to carry out “target audience research.” According to Nauert, the contracts to SCL were aimed at supplementing US anti-ISIS operations in the Middle East.\n\nThe Global Engagement Center is an international influence operation run out of heart of the State Department. Originally formed as the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, and with a mission initially focused on fighting ISIS-oriented propaganda, the operation shifted its focus — and massively expanded its budget — as soon as the national panic over Russian meddling erupted during the 2016 election.\n\nAccording to Richard Stengel, the center’s former director, “we supported credible counter-Russian voices in the region. We pretty much stopped creating content ourselves.” Which voices Stengel was referring to remains unclear, but as the former managing editor of Time Magazine, his remarks raised questions about whether the US government was covertly paying or promoting journalists to advance its agenda in Eastern Europe.\n\nAt a Council on Foreign Relations forum on “fake news” this May, Stengel made an unusually candid disclosure. “My old job at the State Department was what people used to jokingly [call] the chief propagandist job,” he declared. “I’m not against propaganda, every country does it and they have to do it to their own population and I don’t necessarily think it’s that awful.”\n\nAt a Council on Foreign Relations forum about “fake news,” former Editor at Time Magazine Richard Stengel directly states that he supports the use of propaganda on American citizens – then shuts the session down when challenged about how propaganda is used against the third world pic.twitter.com/ClAT5POv7G — William Craddick (@williamcraddick) May 11, 2018\n\nRebranding a toxic name\n\nJust weeks after the collapse of Cambridge Analytica and SCL, the firm’s principals, including Rebekah Mercer, magically resurfaced as directors of a newly minted, London-based company called Emerdata that appears to differ from SCL in name only. In fact, the firm is even headquartered at the same office formerly occupied by SCL Elections.\n\nThe brazen rebranding of SCL/Cambridge Analytica might be disturbing, but these firms are only part of a much wider web of private intelligence firms determined to manipulate the behavior of the public for the benefit of powerful clients. And before these cynical operators applied their methods in Western elections, they tested them on populations in conflict zones like Yemen.\n\nBack in 2011, when he exposed the Romas/COIN mass surveillance program, Barrett Brown warned of the coming blowback for the West. “It is inevitable, then, that such capabilities as form the backbone of Romas/COIN…will be deployed against a growing segment of the world’s population,” Brown wrote. “The powerful institutions that wield them will grow all the more powerful as they are provided better and better methods by which to monitor, deceive, and manipulate. The informed electorate upon which liberty depends will be increasingly misinformed. No tactical advantage conferred by the use of these programs can outweigh the damage that will be done to mankind in the process of creating them.”\n\nSCL/Cambridge Analytica Project Titania Plan for Yemen, Part Two by Max Blumenthalon Scribd\n\nSCL/Cambridge Analytica Project Titania Yemen Plan by Max Blumenthal on Scribd\n\nTruthdig is running a reader-funded project to document the Poor People’s Campaign.

    "article_text": "Just days after Cambridge Analytica announced it would be closing its doors, a new report reveals ties between the data collection political outfit and another company called Emerdata, raising concerns that the same company could simply reemerge under a new name.\n\nLawmakers and former employees of Cambridge Analytica tipped the Financial Times off to its ties to Emerdata, including the same registered address in London, and the same board of directors.\n\nThe revelations led Damian Collins, chair of the U.K. parliamentary select committee for digital, culture, media and sport to compare Cambridge Analytica to “the hydra beast of Greek mythology,” a multi-headed monster that would regrow them if they were cut off. Collins speculated that “it will be business as usual” for the company, simply operating under a different name.\n\nThe Times inquired with Cambridge Analytica about Emerdata, but concerns over the connections were dismissed, and an official portrayed such partnerships as business as usual for an international corporation.\n\nThe data analysis firm announced on Wednesday that it has shut down. The move came after the company was rocked by yet another scandal — a recording of suspended CEO Alexander Nix boasting about entrapping political opponents with bribes and sex.\n\nPreviously, Cambridge Analytica was accused of improperly collecting and using data from Facebook while it worked for the campaign of President Donald Trump. The social network has attempted to distance itself from the company, saying it improperly accessed the private data of millions of users and used it to target political ads on the network.\n\nOWI Take: The swift and unexpected closure of Cambridge Analytica certainly raised eyebrows, and the connections to Emerdata certainly do not inspire confidence that the company is truly shuttered for good. However, close scrutiny from lawmakers, as well as changes to the Facebook platform and the types of data companies have the ability to access, will hopefully limit the reach of Cambridge Analytica, Emerdata, or any other similar firm.",

    "article_text": "Boasting many of the same principals as Cambridge Analytica, that company's announced \"shutdown\" looks a lot like a renaming. And the timing is suspicious.\n\nYesterday, it was reported that Cambridge Analytica, the Trump-connected data-mining firm that improperly accessed Facebook data of 87 million people, was shutting down. But \"shutting down\" may not mean much — many of that company's principal players are associated with a new data company called Emerdata.\n\nWhat is Emerdata?\n\nEmerdata was incorporated in the UK in August 2017 and registered under the same address as Cambridge Analytica in London's Canary Wharf. The board of directors includes Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of the hedge-fund billionaire and primary Cambridge Analytica investor Robert Mercer. Both were appointed to the board on March 15.\n\nAlexander Nix, the Cambridge Analytica CEO who was suspended after he was taped boasting that the firm employed bribery and extortion on political candidates, was originally listed as a director of Emerdata. But he resigned on March 28 and was replaced by Alex Tayler, Cambridge Analytica's chief data officer and acting CEO.\n\nNix had also registered a company called Firecrest Technologies but resigned and was replaced there by Tayler on March 7.\n\nOn Medium, journalist Wendy Siegelman compiled an org chart of Emerdata, illustrating how several of the Cambridge Analytica principals are involved. They include Julian Wheatland, chairman of Cambridge Analytica parent firm SCL Group, and Trump supporter Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater and brother-in-law of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n\nOn March 23, the UK's Channel 4 News reported that Emerdata was set up to acquire Cambridge Analytica and its parent company SCL Group, according to Nigel Oakes, founder of SCL. In the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Oakes said that both SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica were \"closing down.\"\n\nThe timing of the \"shutdown\" may have something to do with ongoing hearings in the UK's Parliament about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica, and whether the company helped bad actors interfere in the Brexit referendum. On Wednesday, a data expert testified that Cambridge Analytica used psychological insights derived from Facebook in the Trump campaign.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Guardian reporter Carole Cadwalladr shared a screenshot of a legal letter the Guardian had been sent by Cambridge Analytica earlier in the year, which stated that the company had \"no employees and very few assets\" — that it was, in essence, a shell company.\n\nIn addition to primarily funding Cambridge Analytica, Robert Mercer funds the Make American #1 PAC, which paid Cambridge Analytica $1.5 million during 2015 and 2016. In March, the Washington Post reported that future presidential adviser and Breitbart chairman Steve Bannon oversaw Cambridge Analytica's data collection and had tested Trump slogans such as \"drain the swamp\" and \"deep state\" well before Trump deployed them during the campaign.",

    "article_text": "Alexander Nix, the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica. Reuters\n\nThe former CEO of Cambridge Analytica allegedly withdrew more than $8 million (£6 million) from the British data firm before its collapse last month.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Alexander Nix is in dispute with investors after he allegedly walked away with the cash, while Cambridge Analytica staff and investors salvaged little or nothing from the company's closure.\n\nSpecifically, the FT said, the dispute is with the investors in Emerdata, a potential successor company set up by the power players at Cambridge Analytica.\n\nEmerdata reportedly raised $19 million from international investors in January, before Cambridge Analytica's role in harvesting the data of 87 million Facebook users became public knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis money ran out quickly, however, because of outstanding bills to advertisers and suppliers, and Nix's alleged withdrawal. Bankruptcy filings in New York show that Cambridge Analytica received an $8.8 million loan from Emerdata before it entered administration, according to the FT.\n\nBusiness Insider has contacted Nix for comment. He has not commented on the allegations so far. People familiar with the matter told the FT that Nix's withdrawal came shortly after the data breach story exploded and was made in \"exchange for unbooked services.\" He intends to repay part of the money, the FT said.\n\nNix was asked about the alleged transaction on Wednesday when he appeared before British lawmakers to answer questions about the Facebook data scandal. \"What I can say is that the allegation in that article is false. The facts in that article are not correct,\" he said.\n\nIt is the second time he will give evidence to the powerful Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport Committee after lawmakers fear he may have misled them during his first hearing.\n\nWhat is Emerdata?\n\nEmerdata was incorporated in the UK last year by several Cambridge Analytica executives before the Facebook scandal thrust their activities into the spotlight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRebekah and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of hedge fund tycoon and prominent Trump supporter Robert Mercer, joined Emerdata as directors as the Cambridge Analytica scandal hit. Another notable director was Johnson Chun Shun Ko, an executive with close links to another Trump supporter, Erik Prince.\n\nThe timing of the appointments contributed to media speculation that Emerdata could succeed Cambridge Analytica, since it involved many of the same people and backers.\n\nBut Nigel Oakes, founder of Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL, told Bloomberg in May that Emerdata had gone into administration. \"The whole lot is gone,\" he said.",

For me to get carried away was deeply embarrassing but something I regret enormously because of the impact on my company and also my staff'.\n\nNix said he was 'entrapped' and the victim of a media conspiracy claiming the extraordinary things he said were 'overzealousness to secure a contract' and 'tell a client what we thought he wanted to hear'.\n\nAlexander Nix said that extraordinary claims he made about sex workers, spies and influencing elections was all lies and hyperbole to impress clients\n\nAlexander Nix arrived at Parliament and denied he had $8million withdrawn from Cambridge Analytica as the Facebook crisis started\n\nMr Nix (right) faced a worldwide media storm in March after he was secretly filmed appearing to suggest the firm use 'beautiful' Ukrainian sex workers to seduce politicians (pictured) - he said it was a 'lie' today\n\nChannel 4 has responded furiously to his claims the documentary was 'heavily edited' and aimed at portraying him and Cambridge Analytica 'in the worst possible light'.\n\nA spokesman said: 'What Mr Nix actually said to our reporter and which was broadcast by Channel 4 News and watched by over 3-million people was that his caveat \"they're just examples of what can be done\" was followed by \"and what has been done\".\n\n'His comments about entrapment to our reporter were not solicited by our undercover reporter, and his comments about using \"Ukrainian girls\" were made unprompted'.\n\nMr Nix was also asked about reports if he withdrew $8million from the firm before its collapse because of the Facebook data scandal and said this was false and claimed he had been secretly investing 'millions' to pay staff wages, bonuses and redundancy payments.\n\nMr Nix allegedly withdrew the cash just after the British media revealed Cambridge Analytica was selling data mined from millions of Facebook members.\n\nThe new allegations over a $8million loan came from disgruntled shareholders who say Mr Nix must repay the money to CA staff and investors.\n\nThese critics, who have spoken to the Financial Times, say Mr Nix and other bosses set up a new company called Emerdata as part of a plan to rebrand CA and its parent company SCL whose reputations have been badly tarnished.\n\nEmerdata raised $19million from investors around the world but the money ran out and insiders claim $8.2million was sent to CA in the form of a loan.\n\nBankruptcy documents filed in New York seen by the newspaper show that the cash is classed a 'non-priority' and may never have to be paid back.\n\nThe FT has reported that Nix has indicated he will pay back some of the money, said to diverted for unpaid services, but he is facing pressure to return it all.\n\nMr Nix said today that the story was false and in the past three months he had personally paid millions in for staff pay and bonuses.\n\nAlexander Nic has been recalled to face MPs today over evidence he gave them in February (pictured)\n\nMr Nix, a polo loving millionaire (pictured centre), was suspended from the company and has not commented on allegations about the $8million loan\n\nHe started his evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee with a row over his appearance and kept trying to read a prepared statement.\n\nHe denied he didn't want to attend but admitted he wanted any hearing to be postponed or held behind closed doors.\n\nHe accepted his answers in February - when he denied working with the Leave.EU campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum - 'could have been clearer'.\n\nBut he was interrupted by committee chair Damian Collins, who insisted he would not allow witnesses to read out prepared statements, rather than responding to questions from the cross-party panel of MPs.\n\nMr Nix (pictured in March) has been summoned to Parliament 'clarify his original evidence' after he declined to turn up in April\n\nAfter Mr Nix made several attempts to restart the statement, Mr Collins cut him short, telling him: 'The way this works is we ask questions and witnesses answer them.'\n\nThe former CA boss told him: 'Mr Collins, you will have plenty of opportunity to ask me as many questions as you want, but I have to insist on delivering the rest of this statement.'\n\nMr Collins responded: 'I'm sorry, Mr Nix, it is not your place to insist on anything in front of this committee.'\n\nMr Nix faced a worldwide media storm in March after he was secretly filmed appearing to suggest the firm use 'beautiful' Ukrainian sex workers to seduce politicians as part of its lucrative election work.\n\nHe was also recorded boasting about the firm's work during the Donald Trump presidential campaign, saying: 'We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting, we ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.'\n\nNix said its data on voters wins elections and his company made huge sums working with politicians around the globe.\n\nFacebook had given CA access to the personal data of tens of millions of users, without the users' knowledge - they claimed the company lied to them and they had no idea they would sell it on.\n\nThere were calls for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to resign and he saw £5.3billion wiped off his £48billion personal fortune yesterday due to a plunge in the social media company's share price.\n\nSince then Zuckerberg has been forced to apologise and try to rebuild trust with users about the safety of their data.\n\nAlexander Nix is at Parliament today and has been recalled to give evidence to an inquiry into fake news.\n\nThe businessman first appeared before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee in February.\n\nWeeks later CA was suspended by Facebook amid allegations it amassed data on millions of voters from their profiles and misused it.\n\nAmong the allegations were claims the information was used to target voters during Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign, while a whistleblower has claimed the firm had links to pro-Brexit campaigners.\n\nOn Monday, the head of Britain's data watchdog said she was 'deeply concerned' about the impact on democracy of the misuse of social media users' personal information.\n\nThe committee first recalled Mr Nix to appear before them on April 18 to 'clarify his original evidence'.\n\nAfter agreeing to attend he then declined, but he was issued with a formal summons by MPs.\n\nThe scandal that erupted around CA's alleged misuse of Facebook data saw the social media giant's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, issue a series of public apologies.\n\nThe billionaire went before the US Congress and has been asked to appear before the DCMS committee.\n\nMark Zuckerberg's fortune and reputation have been badly damaged by the scandal, pictured facing Congress where he issued a humbling apology\n\nChairman Damian Collins wrote to Facebook on May 1 after Mike Schroepfer, the network's chief technology officer, spoke to the committee.\n\nMr Collins said his evidence 'lacked many of the important details we need' and re-stated Mr Zuckerberg's invitation.\n\n'It is worth noting that, while Mr Zuckerberg does not normally come under the jurisdiction of the UK Parliament, he will do so the next time he enters the country,' Mr Collins wrote.\n\n'We hope that he will respond positively to our request, but if not the committee will resolve to issue a formal summons for him to appear when he is next in the UK.'\n\nInformation Commissioner Elizabeth Denham told the European Parliament's inquiry into the CA affair that legal systems had failed to keep up with the rapid and unforeseen development of the internet.\n\nMs Denham said that her office's investigation, triggered by allegations of misuse of Facebook users' personal data, was 'unprecedented in its scale' and thought to be the largest undertaken by any data protection authority in the world.",

    "article_text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nFor months, Cambridge Analytica employees had heard whispers of a rebrand that would save their business.\n\nOn Thursday, any lingering hope was extinguished when the embattled data firm linked to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign declared bankruptcy despite weeks of efforts to leave behind its controversial past.\n\nEven before CEO Alexander Nix was ousted after an undercover investigation showed him bragging about using sex workers to entrap the political opponents of prospective clients, the data firm was preparing to combine with parent company SCL under a new company called Emerdata. There was talk of rebranding under a new name, Anaxi, or possibly Firecrest Technologies, according to three former senior employees at the company, each of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their interest in finding new employment.\n\nBut on May 2, without warning, Cambridge Analytica’s acting CEO Julian Wheatland announced to some 40 staffers in the New York office that Cambridge Analytica and SCL were no more, that the companies were filing for bankruptcy, and that employees should clean out their desks by 12:30. The meeting, which was postponed half a dozen times already, had started by that time.\n\nThe staffers were packed into a conference room, with Wheatland at the head of the table. As he read a scripted speech, Wheatland “got emotional,” according to former employees. He didn’t mention severance or next steps. The CEO simply told those in the room to send any questions to the human resources representative.\n\nCambridge Analytica' s offices in London. Andy Rain / EPA file\n\n“He literally grabbed his belongings and got on a plane,” said one senior employee. “He didn’t even say goodbye.”\n\nThe rebrand now dead, Cambridge Analytica’s remaining U.S. employees filed out of their office on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and into P.J. Moran’s, a nearby Irish pub.\n\n“You know how people go through the stages of grief? This was acceptance,” a former executive said. “You could kind of see the writing on the wall, but most people never thought it was going to be total bankruptcy.”\n\nNBC News learned of previously unreported details about the company’s big-name client list, and its failed attempts at rebranding in the two weeks after the company’s abrupt shuttering.\n\nTo some employees, the announcement was a relief. In the final two months, all of Cambridge Analytica, from junior employees to executives, had stopped normal operations and were either wasting time or engaged in damage control.\n\nWhile in-house copywriters worked on new company names, designers pushed out possible logos for a rebranded marketing and analytics firm. One iteration, a red bird reminiscent of the Twitter icon, was roundly criticized.\n\nThere was a lot of down time. Facebook had cut off their access to the social network’s developer system and wasn’t returning their calls, leaving employees unable to do work for existing clients and the sales team incapable of selling their services during the scandal.\n\nInstead, the dozens of U.S. employees played Nerf basketball. They gathered around the big screen and watched episodes of “The Office.” Someone made popcorn.\n\nThe Client List\n\nOn March 17, The Observer and The New York Times revealed the company had harvested private data from over 50 million Facebook users. Three days later an undercover investigation from NBC News’ U.K. partner ITN Channel 4 showed company head Alexander Nix pitching tactics that included bribery of local officials and extortion using Ukrainian women as bait.\n\nThe negative press surrounding President Trump, whose campaign employed the firm, was always hard, former employees said. But the Channel 4 video of Nix was “particularly sickening” for staffers who had gathered around a screen to watch.\n\n“Our jaws were on the floor,” one former employee said. “Like, ‘I can’t believe it. That’s the nail in the coffin.’”\n\nCambridge Analytica’s board, helmed by GOP mega donors Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, responded to the video by suspending Nix, explaining in a statement that his comments did “not represent the values or operations of the firm.”\n\nThe plan all along, though, had been to move away from politics. Cambridge Analytica opened its Fifth Avenue office in 2016, hoping to spin political success into gold by attracting corporate and ad agency clients.\n\nCommercial clients were less volatile and more dependable, the contracts lasted longer than a normal political campaign cycle and wouldn’t leave their brand tarnished because of links to certain politicians.\n\n“The goal was to try to get as many clients as we could that weren’t tied to Donald Trump,” a former executive said.",

(Image Source: Bloomberg) Cambridge Analytica announced last week that it was beginning bankruptcy proceedings, saying the media storm over its use of Facebook data had scared clients away. (Image Source: Bloomberg)\n\nWhen the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica announced last week it would be closing its doors and filing for bankruptcy in the wake of the Facebook Inc data scandal, speculation mounted that it would be revived under the guise of two new companies set up in London. Not so, said Nigel Oakes, the founder of Cambridge Analytica’s British affiliate, SCL Group. “It’s the end of the show,” he said by phone Tuesday. “The whole lot is gone. There’s no secret. For anything like this to recreate itself you need a team of people to work together but nobody is working together. Everybody has gone off to do their own things.”\n\nSeveral media outlets had pointed to filings on UK business registry Companies House showing Cambridge Analytica executives had set up a London-based firm in August 2017 called Emerdata Ltd. Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, the daughters of conservative hedge fund tycoon and Trump supporter Robert Mercer, joined the board in March.\n\nOakes said the original idea was to acquire Cambridge Analytica and SCL and put them under one roof. Now Emerdata is also in administration, he said. Firecrest Technologies Ltd, another company created in March by former Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Officer Alexander Nix, would also be wound down, he said. Firecrest’s main shareholder was Emerdata, according to company filings. Nix declined to comment when reached by phone.\n\nBoth companies were set up before revelations from a whistle blower were released in March that Cambridge Analytica had misused data from millions of Facebook users that underpinned work on US President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Oakes didn’t say what would happen to the company’s intellectual property or the voter profile data it had built. “That’s the end of it,” Oakes said. “The whole group has been closed down. There’s no other organization that’s been created.”\n\nCambridge Analytica announced last week that it was beginning bankruptcy proceedings, saying the media storm over its use of Facebook data had scared clients away. The scandal worsened with the release of an undercover video showing Nix talking about the use of bribery to trap politicians in foreign election campaigns. The company then suspended Nix while it started an independent investigation. The results of that investigation challenged some of the allegations made about how the firm acquired Facebook data, but the company concluded it still couldn’t continue.\n\n“Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,” the company said in a statement announcing insolvency proceedings.\n\nFor all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App",

Communications firms Cambridge Analytica has offices in London, New York, Washington, as well as Brazil and Malaysia. The company boasts it can 'find your voters and move them to action' through data-driven campaigns and a team that includes data scientists and behavioural psychologists. 'Within the United States alone, we have played a pivotal role in winning presidential races as well as congressional and state elections,' with data on more than 230 million American voters, Cambridge Analytica claims on its website. The company profited from a feature that meant apps could ask for permission to access your own data as well as the data of all your Facebook friends. The data firm suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix (pictured), after recordings emerged of him making a series of controversial claims, including boasts that Cambridge Analytica had a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump This meant the company was able to mine the information of 87 million Facebook users even though just 270,000 people gave them permission to do so. This was designed to help them create software that can predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box. The data firm suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after recordings emerged of him making a series of controversial claims, including boasts that Cambridge Analytica had a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump. This information is said to have been used to help the Brexit campaign in the UK.\n\nAll entities have the same London address - the offices of PKF Littlejohn based in Canary Wharf.\n\nOn Wednesday, executive and part owner of SCL Group - which formed Cambridge Analytica - described Emerdata as a way of combing the two companies under a single banner, reported New York Times.\n\nTwo more of the firm's directors are Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer.\n\nThey are daughters of hedge fund billionaire and prominent Donald Trump supporter Robert Mercer, who is also reported to be a major investor in Cambridge Analytica.\n\nRebekah Mercer's New York contact address is the same as Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCambridge Analytica issued a statement saying it was starting bankruptcy proceedings due to a 'seige of media coverage'.

    "article_text": "After indulging in massive data theft, in their attempt to ensure a victory for their clients by spreading lies through the Social Websites, Cambridge Analytica and SCL have announced closure of their firms due to unavoidable circumstances. The Founder Director has also appealed to the Government to compensate or clear the debts blaming the media hullabaloo that caused company running up huge debts becoming bankrupt and thus facing closure. It literally means that Cambridge Analytica is on the streets. We may be under the impression that It serves them right, they are paying for all their sins and thus ended up on the streets. But unfortunately that will only be our delusion!\n\nHave they really shut shop? In the event they have, what will happen to clients from various countries who have paid for their services?\n\nNo, Cambridge Analytica and SCL group founders have not really shut shop. They have become Directors of other companies that they have established. These companies are:\n\nEmerdata Private Limited Firecrest Technologies Private Limited Frontier Services Group Citic Group (formerly China International Trust Investment Corporation, a state-owned investment company of People’s Republic of China) Fanalytica Private Limited\n\nWe have already heard about the Congress party paying more than Rs 800 Crore to Cambridge Analytica. Just imagine, if the Congress party from India has paid Rs 800 Crore (as it is alleged to have paid), how much they must have received from other countries of the world. Cambridge Analytica is not foolish. It is working for its clients, including the Congress Party by operating under other Company names.\n\nCambridge Analytica was always aware that one day or the other it would end up on the streets. But they may not have dreamt that the day would come so soon. Nevertheless, Emerdata was incorporated in the UK with Registration no 1091188 on 1st August 2017 with its Headquarters in Canary Wharf, London, reports Business Insider.\n\nAccording to public records from Britain’s Companies House, Emerdata’s board of directors include Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of the hedge-fund billionaire and primary Cambridge Analytica investor Robert Mercer. What is surprising is that between August 2017 and 28th February 2018, there were no operations whatsoever. Like all other companies in England it is registered on the Government’s website where it has listed its business objective as “data processing, hosting and related activities”. In reality, they began their activities only from 1st March 2018.\n\nFollowing details makes it even more clear that all the 4 companies are that of Cambridge Analytica.\n\nBankrolling for Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group was done by the father of Rebecca Mercer & Jennifer Mercer. These two have also been appointed as Directors of the 1 year old Emerdata from 16th March 2018. Similarly, Julian David Wheatland, who was the Chairman of Cambridge Analytica, has a 25-50% shareholding in Emerdata and is also a Director since 11th August 2017. Current CEO Dr Alexandar Bruce Taylor also assumed charge as Director from 28th March 2018 with a shareholding of 25-50%. More famous personality Ex-CEO of Cambridge Analytica Alexander Nix is also a Director in Emerdata since 23rd January 2018. However, since Alexander Nix was sacked from Cambridge Analytica, he also got sacked from Emerdata.\n\nThe fun begins here – Nix was sacked publicly, but there exists a group company of Emerdata by name Firecrest Techonolgies Pvt Limited. The sole director of that firm is Alexander Nix, who holds this position since 7th March 2018. Firecrest Technologies was established on the same day, 7th March 2018. Firecres Technologies is in such proximity that you can peep through any window of Emerdata Building to find it. The unique registration number for Firecrest is 11238956. You can thus conclude that the core team of Cambridge Analytica: Rebecca Mercer, Jennifer Mercer, Julian David Wheatland, Dr Alexander Bruce Taylor – those who sacked Alexander Nix from the company – all work under Alexander Nix in Firecrest – Pirates of the same ship.\n\nNot only that, the other Directors of Emerdata, Ahmad Al Khatib, Cheng Peng, Johnson Chun Shun Ko have joined the company on 23rd January 2018. Among these Chun Shun Ko is the Executive Director and Vice President of Frontier Services Group. This company operates in the Data related domain as well, and is owned by CITIC group. CITIC being a company of Chinese origin, was also working secretly with Cambridge Analytica. After Cambridge Analytica, it now works for Emerdata and Firecrest.\n\nNow that the details of the companies are clear, let us look into how they operate.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica’s announcing of the closure of its operation since Wednesday is not due to lack of funds. Instead, they announced the closure after all the stolen data were transferred to Emerdata. Having done that, they are working briskly from Emerdata. They are hiring more and more people and working at a breakneck speed. For whom is this speed? Is it for Congress? It is alleged that they received more than 800 crores from the Congress party to make them victorious in 2018 Karnataka Elections and 2019 General Elections. Looking at the speed at which Emerdata is working, it appears that the allegation may indeed turn out to be true.\n\nShehzad Poonwalah has in fact shown with documentary evidence that prior to assuming charge as President of Congress, Rahul Ghandhi had met Alexander Nix and discussed about Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh, and Lok Sabha elections and closed the deal for the same. The Congress party, which otherwise pounces on anything is silent thus far.\n\nAmidst these, it was also alleged that many authors, journalists, cinema actors were paid by Cambridge Analytica. Even in our state, we have an actor, who plays negative roles, who has started releasing a video a day as if possessed by the spirit of that grey haired leftist lady and has thus become a headache for the state. Notice his development as well. Initially, this actor began by starting a campaign asking questions on Twitter and Facebook without spending a single penny. Now he has a team just to question Modi and BJP. They follow him everywhere to make videos, adding graphics and effects and releasing it online. Bragging initially that he will question all politicians, this actor is now spending money from his pocket to design Videos – begs a question. Is Emerdata funding him? Or has Cambridge Analytica already given him funding?\n\nEven now all the activities carried out earlier under the name of Cambridge Analytica is being done by Emerdata, Firecrest Technologies, Frontier Services Group, CITIC Group and Fanalytica Private Limited. Since Cambridge Analytica is the known name, their illegal activities are not visible.\n\nOne demon called Cambridge Analytica is dead, but 5 other demons have taken birth from it. There are hundreds more who work closely with these five again. The contract is handed out to Break India. It is high time these demons are dismantled.\n\nThe article originally appeared in Kannada newspaper Hosa Digantha and has been translated and published with author’s permission.\n\nDisclaimer: The opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author.

    "article_text": "US Facebook users haven't been deterred by the firm's massive data scandal.\n\nThree-quarters of Facebook users have remained as active, or even more active, on the site since the Cambridge Analytica scandal first developed in March, a new poll conducted by Reuters and Ipsos has found.\n\nThe social media giant has been on the hot seat since it was revealed earlier this year that more than 87 million users' data had been harvested without their knowledge by Trump-affiliated research firm Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe poll adds to other indications that Facebook has so far suffered no hits to its user base from the episode, other than a public relations headache.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) has been on the hot seat since the Cambridge Analytica scandal first erupted. But a new Reuters poll indicates US users have remained loyal\n\nFacebook declined to comment.\n\nIts executives have apologized for the data-harvesting, pledged to investigate others who collected Facebook user data and reduced the amount of data available to similar app developers now.\n\nThe national online poll, conducted this month, found that about half of Facebook's American users said they had not recently changed the amount that they used the site, and another quarter said they were using it more.\n\nThe remaining quarter said that they were using it less recently, had stopped using it or deleted their account.\n\nThat means that the people using Facebook less were roughly balanced by those using it more, with no clear net loss or gain in use.\n\nAmong all adults, 64 percent said they use Facebook at least once a day, down slightly from 68 percent who said so in a similar poll in late March, shortly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal first erupted.\n\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll collected responses from over 2,000 respondents, including users who are active on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nAmong all adults, 64 percent said they use Facebook at least once a day, down slightly from 68 percent who said so in late March, shortly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal first erupted\n\nMore Facebook users said they knew how to protect their personal information on the site than users of other social media platforms like Snapchat, Instagram, Pinterest and Tumblr.\n\nAccording to the poll, 74 percent of Facebook users said they were aware of their current privacy settings, while 78 percent said they knew how to change them.\n\nBy comparison, 60 percent of Instagram users said they knew their current privacy settings and 65 percent said they knew how to change them.\n\nAnd 55 percent of Twitter users knew their privacy settings, and 58 percent knew how to use them.\n\nDespite their understanding of Facebook's privacy settings, only 23 percent of its users believe they have \"total control\" over the information they store on the platform.\n\nAnother 49 percent said they have \"some control,\" and 20 percent said they had \"no control.\" The remaining 9 percent said they do not know how much control they have.\n\nMore Facebook users said they knew how to protect their personal data on the site than users of other social media platforms like Snapchat, Instagram (pictured), Pinterest and Tumblr\n\nWHAT IS THE CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA SCANDAL? Communications firms Cambridge Analytica has offices in London, New York, Washington, as well as Brazil and Malaysia. The company boasts it can 'find your voters and move them to action' through data-driven campaigns and a team that includes data scientists and behavioural psychologists. 'Within the United States alone, we have played a pivotal role in winning presidential races as well as congressional and state elections,' with data on more than 230 million American voters, Cambridge Analytica claims on its website. The company profited from a feature that meant apps could ask for permission to access your own data as well as the data of all your Facebook friends. The data firm suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix (pictured), after recordings emerged of him making a series of controversial claims, including boasts that Cambridge Analytica had a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump This meant the company was able to mine the information of 87 million Facebook users even though just 270,000 people gave them permission to do so. This was designed to help them create software that can predict and influence voters' choices at the ballot box. The data firm suspended its chief executive, Alexander Nix, after recordings emerged of him making a series of controversial claims, including boasts that Cambridge Analytica had a pivotal role in the election of Donald Trump. This information is said to have been used to help the Brexit campaign in the UK.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said Facebook is lucky the data seems to have been used only for political ads and not more nefarious purposes.\n\n'I have yet to read an article that says a single person has been harmed by the breach,' he said.\n\n'Nobody's outraged on a visceral level'.\n\nA separate poll conducted recently by Reuters found that people trust Facebook to protect their data less than other popular tech platforms.\n\nRoughly 41 percent of Americans trust Facebook to guard their information, while 66 percent said they trust Amazon, 62 percent said they trust Google, 60 percent trust Microsoft and 47 percent trust Yahoo, which has dealt with a string of recent data breaches.\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal broke on March 16, sparking interest online in the hashtag #deletefacebook as many users said they considered fleeing the platform.\n\nHOW TO CHECK IF YOUR DATA WAS SHARED WITH CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA All 2.2 billion Facebook users began to receive a notification automatically at the top their newsfeed after it was launched on Tuesday, April 10, a day later than expected. Titled 'Protecting Your Information,' it contains a link to let you see what apps you use and what information you have shared with them. Affected users are automatically presented with a notice that says: 'We have banned the website \"This Is Your Digital Life,\" which one of your friends used Facebook to log into. 'We did this because the website may have misused some of your Facebook information by sharing it with a company called Cambridge Analytica.' Users can then click on a 'See how you're affected' button to find out more as well as to remove permission for apps and websites you've logged into via Facebook to have access to your profile. For those not affected by the Cambridge Analytica incident the message reads: 'You can go to the Apps and Websites section of your settings anytime to see the apps and websites you've used Facebook to log into.' The 'Go to apps and websites' button will provide quick access to review and amend these permissions. A separate 'How can I tell if my info was shared with Cambridge Analytica?' tool will also resolve the question for you. To manually access this tool, click the link here. Users not believed to be affected will see the message 'Based on our available records, neither you nor your friends logged into \"This Is Your Digital Life.\" 'As a result, it doesn't appear your Facebook information was shared with Cambridge Analytica by \"This Is Your Digital Life\".' Affected users will see a different message and they will be asked to to change their app settings, available here. This is something that is still advisable for the security conscious, removing permissions for apps you no longer need or don't recognise. Facebook is not notifying individual users of the identify of friends who may have used the 'This Is Your Digital Life' app.\n\nIn its first quarter results, however, Facebook said the number of monthly users in the United States and Canada rose to 241 million on March 31 from 239 million on Dec. 31, growth that was roughly in line with recent years.\n\nCambridge Analytica has suffered a much worse outcome as fallout from the scandal, with the firm announcing last week it has started bankruptcy proceedings after a 'siege of media coverage'.\n\nHowever, this may not be the end for its owners.\n\nTwo new London-based companies, Firecrest Technologies and Emerdata, have been set up with the same registered address, same purpose and same directors.\n\nA former Cambridge Analytica employee and senior lawmakers have suggested these two companies could be picking up where Cambridge Analytica left off.",

    "article_text": "Alexander Nix, 42, was the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, a company that has come under intense scrutiny for possibly mining Facebook data against Facebook’s terms. And now Nix is in the spotlight even more, after Channel 4 in London released undercover videos showing Nix talking about underhanded methods that Cambridge Analytica may use during campaigns, including sending girls to candidates’ houses. CA suspended Nix on Tuesday, effective immediately, and is launching an investigation into whether the company did any wrongdoing.\n\nCambridge Analytica is also being investigated because its data may have, in part, been used to help President Donald Trump’s campaign. The data analysis firm also came under scrutiny for possibly hiring non-American citizens to work on American election campaigns, The Guardian reported, among other issues that are being investigated.\n\nAs part of his investigation, Special Counsel Robert Mueller has requested the firm turn over internal documents. Nix is also the Director of SCL Group (SCL is short for Strategic Communications Laboratories), a private communication company that formed Cambridge Analytica specifically for working on elections in the U.S. Nix is a highly private person who tries not to share much about his personal life with the media, an interesting preference considering the focus of his business is mining data to create psychological profiles. Here is everything you need to know about Alexander Nix.\n\n1. Undercover Interviews Revealed Nix and Other Cambridge Analytica Employees Discussing Shady Practices to Help Clients’ Campaigns, Including Sending Girls to Opponents’ Homes\n\nChannel 4 reporters posed as prospective clients and secretly recorded interviews with employees of Cambridge Analytica about their business practices, including Alexander Nix, Financial Times reported. Financial Times said that CA was trying to prevent the report from airing on London’s Channel 4, and that wouldn’t be the first time. Carole Cadwalladr, a reporter for The Guardian, said that Facebook and Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue The Guardian to prevent its recent story about CA from publishing. Channel 4 released the report on Monday, which shows secret recordings with senior CA executives, including Nix. The films were made between November 2017 and January 2018. An undercover Channel 4 reporter posed as a wealthy client looking for help with Sri Lanka campaigns.\n\nIn the secret interviews, Nix said the firm campaigns in elections across the world and operates through a series of shadow front companies or through sub-contractors, Channel 4 reported. They try to dig up dirt on opponents of their clients. Nix said they sometimes “send some girls around to the candidate’s house,” and those Ukrainian girls are “very beautiful, I find that works well.”\n\nHe said that they also offer large amounts of money to a candidate, offering to finance a campaign in exchange for land or other favors. They record the offers, blank out the face of their employee, and post the video online. Channel 4 pointed out that offering bribes to public officials violates the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\nNix also said that CA may set up fake IDs and websites for clients who don’t want to be seen working with a foreign company, Channel 4 reported. “We can be students doing research projects attached to a university, we can be tourists, there’s so many options we can look at.”\n\nA CA spokesman said in response to the recordings: “We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates use entrapment, bribes, or so-called ‘honey-traps’ for any purpose whatsoever… We routinely undertake conversations with prospective clients to try to tease out any unethical or illegal intentions… Cambridge Analytica does not use untrue material for any purpose.”\n\n2. Alexander Nix Was a Financial Analyst Before Moving to Behavioral Products\n\nAlexander James Ashburner Nix was born May 1, 1975 and grew up in London’s Notting Hill. He was educated at Eton College and Manchester University, according to his bio. He studied the history of art at Manchester. He began working as a financial analyst with Baring Securities in Mexico. Then he moved on to Robert Fraser & Partners LLP, a finance and tax advisory firm in the U.K. In 2003, he became director of the SCL Group, focusing on behavioral products and services. In 2007, he began focusing on elections and opened offices in Washington D.C. and Delhi, expanding his global staff to more than 300 employees. He has worked on political campaigns across the world. The Huffington Post described him as not being a data scientist but “a showy salesman.” “He is in his element on stage making presentations at large conferences.”\n\nIn 2010, Nix opened SCL Social, a not-for-profit agency focused on using SCL’s behavioral strategies for humanitarian and health projects. A gallery here shows an interior design company working on pieces for his “bachelor flat” in London. In 2016, he was named one of “25 Geniuses Who Are Creating the Future of Business” by Wired Magazine.\n\nCheck out Alexander Nix on Radio Coup D’etat with Gonzalo Oliveros this morning! pic.twitter.com/4QgVhXxhOO — Cambridge Analytica (@CamAnalytica) February 10, 2017\n\nAccording to Company Check, Nix has Director positions at SCL Elections Limited, SCL Social Limited, SCL Commercial Limited, Cambridge Analytica (UK), SCL Sovereign Limited (now dissolved), SCL Digital Limited (now dissolved), SCL Analytics Limited, SCL Group Limited, Emerdata Limited (appointed in January 2018), Firecrest Technologies Limited (appointed in March 2018.) Emerdata is described as working in “data processing, hosting, and related activities.” The company was incorporated on August 11, 2017.\n\nWhen The Canberra Times set up an interview with Nix to profile him, he bristled at first when the reporter asked about his childhood and his education, saying he thought he was only giving a business interview. “I think I’ve wasted your time… I’m quite a private person. I don’t think it’s necessarily in my best interests to share my life with other people. I’m sorry about that. But I’m just feeling uncomfortable about this. I don’t think that I want to be the story.” When the reporter protested that it was ironic considering his business, Nix said that talking about his personal life was more intrusive, and that subjects like his favorite breakfast wouldn’t be relevant. He loosened up a little later in the interview and shared more details. He collects art, he said, and supports the London artist Hormazd Narielwalla. “When I get spare time, I will frequently try to find a museum or a gallery.”\n\n3. Since He’s British, He Could Not Legally Work on Cambridge Analytica’s U.S. Campaigns\n\nA lawyer sent a memo to Steve Bannon, Rebekah Mercer, and Alexander Nix warning about U.S. election law that prohibits non-Americans from working on American election campaigns, The Guardian reported. That included Nix, who is British. The memo read, in part: “To the extent you are aware of foreign nationals providing services, including polling and marketing, it would appear that unless it is being done through US citizens, or foreign nationals with green cards, the activity would violate the law… In order for Cambridge to engage in such activities, Mr Nix would first have to be recused from substantive management of any such clients involved in US elections.”\n\nThe Guardian said that employees told them that Cambridge Analytica ignored that warning. Cambridge Analytica told The Guardian that Nix had not violated the law. “He has never had a strategic or operational role on any election campaigns undertaken in the U.S.”\n\nNix told TechCrunch in late 2017 that he planned to write a book about Cambridge Analytica’s methods, and the working title was “Mad Men to Maths Men.” The book will come out in Germany first, with a German publisher, and then it will be published in the U.K. and internationally.\n\n4. Alexander Nix Reached Out to Julian Assange Before the November 2016 Election\n\nJulian Assange confirmed in a tweet in October 2017 that Cambridge Analytica had contacted him before the election, and the company’s request was denied.\n\nI can confirm an approach by Cambridge Analytica [prior to November last year] and can confirm that it was rejected by WikiLeaks. — Julian Assange ⌛ (@JulianAssange) October 25, 2017\n\nWe now know that Alexander Nix was the person who reached out to Assange, but the nature of his request is still debated. The Daily Beast reported that Nix reached out to Assange in an email about the missing 33,000 emails. Two sources said that he wanted to see if Cambridge Analytica could help WikiLeaks release the missing emails, but the request was turned down. However, a report from The Wall Street Journal indicated that Nix’s message, sent in August 2016, was actually about helping with the DNC and Podesta emails that WikiLeaks released. Nix told employees in an email that he had reached out to Assange to offer help with indexing messages that WikiLeaks was planning to release, in order to help the messages be more easily searchable. Nix said in his email that he did not hear back from Assange, but Assange said that he turned Nix down. Assange did not clarify what the offer was, he simply tweeted later: “We have confirmed the approach and rejection only. Not the subject.”\n\n5. Nix & Cambridge Analytica Focus on Using Personality Metrics to Frame a Message So It Resonates with Specific Groups\n\nNix explained in 2016 that the company probes “the underlying traits that inform personality.” He added: “If you know the personality of the people you’re targeting, you can nuance your messaging to resonate more effectively with those key groups.” Vox pointed out that so far, most of the firm’s clients have been Republican, including Ted Cruz and Ben Carson. The company also mined data for the Brexit campaign. (However, Nix denies that CA had any involvement with Brexit.) Nix said the company has “close to 4 or 5 thousand data points on every adult in the U.S.”\n\nThis is apparently part of what Cambridge Analytica was doing on Facebook that brought it under scrutiny.\n\nCambridge Analytica has come under scrutiny for its mining of Facebook data about people in America and the U.S., which was used to create personality and political profiles for politicians and others. Allegations say that the profiles were, in part, used to help President Donald Trump’s campaign. An app called “thisisyourdigitallife” created personality quizzes that were, at least in part, taken by people who were paid on platforms like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. By taking the quizzes, their information and their Facebook friends’ data was shared. It’s important to point out that this method of mining Facebook data is actually part of each app’s Terms of Service and is not unusual. Almost any quiz that you take on Facebook will include a TOS that says you agree to share information about yourself and your friends. These broad terms of service have come under fire before, however. The use of this data has been discussed in media articles since at least 2015. Here’s one story about the privacy concerns from last year.\n\nOn March 16, 2018, Facebook wrote a statement explaining why it decided to suspend Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group from Facebook. Yes, they said, Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, who created the app, did use the app in a legitimate way. However, he described the app as “a research app used by psychologists.” He then violated Facebook’s terms by passing the information on to third parties, including Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook learned of that violation in 2015, they removed the app and demanded certifications that all the data was destroyed, which he provided. Facebook found out this month that all the data may not have been deleted, thus leading to the suspension. They are investigating those claims. Cambridge Analytica, meanwhile, says that they followed all of Facebook’s terms and deleted all the data it received from Global Research Science when it learned they weren’t complying with the terms. Cambridge has stated that none of GSR’s data was used for Trump’s campaign.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch in late 2017, Nix said that although “psychographic targeting” was used for Carson and Cruz’s primaries, by the time they got to Trump’s campaign, there wasn’t time to use surveys. And Trump’s campaign’s infrastructure was too small. There was “baked-in” psychographic data from previous work, but no “long form quantitative psychographics survey” done for Trump. In his interview, he didn’t comment on claims that the company had harvested Facebook data, but did say the data was built on surveys of more than 10,000 people. CA was hired by Trump’s campaign, he said, because no other usual supplier would touch the candidate. They ended up taking over Trump’s data analytics, research, TV, digital, and even donations.\n\nAn undercover investigation by Channel 4 revealed that Cambridge Analytica was more involved in Trump’s campaign than some had though. They said their data research allowed Trump to win a margin of 40,000 votes in three states, which helped him win the electoral election despite losing the popular vote. Senior executives discussed putting out positive messages about Trump while also putting out negative material about others, which was pushed through outside organizations not associated with CA. Turnbull said that CA created a “Defeat Crooked Hillary” series of ads funded by a super-PAC called Make America Number 1. The company insisted there was a strict firewall between work they did for PACs and work they did for Trump’s political campaign.\n\nNix, however, said that CA has a self-destructing email system called ProtonMail that leaves no trace. He later said that the House Intel Committee members he talked to were “not technical.” “They don’t understand how it works,” he said.\n\nNix also referred to political candidates as “puppets.” “They don’t understand because the candidate never, is never involved. He’s told what to do by the campaign team.”\n\nCambridge Analytica also denies any involvement in helping Trump win. A spokesman said: “CA has never claimed it won the election for President Trump. This is patently absurd. We are proud of the work we did on that campaign, and have spoken in many public forums about what we consider to be our contribution to the campaign.”",

    "article_text": "Nachdem sich die Politik und die Öffentlichkeit in den vergangenen Wochen mit dem Datenskandal bei Facebook beschäftigt haben, steht Facebook unter Zugzwang. Bereits vor den Anhörungen von Facebook-Gründer Mark Zuckerberg vor dem US-Kongress hatte das Unternehmen mehrere Massnahmen angekündigt oder eingeleitet, um den Zugriff von Dritten auf die Profildaten bei Facebook zu beschränken.\n\nDas Analyse-Unternehmen Cambridge Analytica, das im Zentrum des Datenskandals von Facebook steht, hatte Profildaten von Facebook-Nutzern erhalten, die über die Anwendung «This is your digital life» generiert worden waren. Aleksandr Kogan, Forscher an der Cambridge University und Gründer des Unternehmens GSR Global Science Research Limited, griff mit dieser Befragungs-App nicht nur Daten der Befragungsteilnehmer, sondern auch von Freunden dieser Teilnehmer ab.\n\nMit diesen Massnahmen will Facebook gegensteuern\n\nKlaus Breyer, Chief Technology Officer, Buzzbird Zoom Eine der Massnahmen, mit der Facebook auf die Weitergabe von Nutzerdaten reagiert, ist die Aktualisierung der Nutzungsbedingungen und der Datenschutzrichtlinie. Um eine verständliche Sprache bemüht, erklärt Facebook den Nutzern, wie es Daten verwendet und «warum diese notwendig sind, um die Beiträge und Werbeanzeigen», die der Nutzer sieht, «aber auch Gruppen, Freunde und Seiten», die das Unternehmen vorschlägt, zu individualisieren.\n\nDie zweite Massnahme, die Facebook ergreift, ist eine Beschränkung der Informationen, die Dritte und Entwickler über Programmierschnittstellen, kurz API (Application Programming Interface), abgreifen können. Zum einen will Facebook Apps künftig stärker kontrollieren. Zum anderen limitiert das soziale Netzwerk die Zahl der Informationen, die über bestimmte Schnittstellen abgefragt werden können. Im Fall von Instagram wird beispielsweise die Anzahl der stündlichen Abrufe von Informationen über die Instagram-API von 5000 auf 200 reduziert.\n\nViele Unternehmen der digitalen Werbewirtschaft, deren Tools auf den Facebook-API basieren, beobachten sehr aufmerksam, welche Vorgaben Facebook für die Verwendung der verschiedenen Schnittstellen nun macht. Ein Blick auf die Aufzählung, welche Schnittstellen künftig stärker kontrolliert oder eingeschränkt werden, offenbart gleichzeitig auch den Umfang der Informationen, auf die Dritte bisher Zugriff hatten. Die Einschränkungen des Datenzugriffs hat Mike Schroepfer, Chief Technology Officer bei Facebook, im Unternehmens-Blog veröffentlicht.\n\n«Facebook und Instagram reglementieren jetzt, wer in welchem Umfang auf öffentlich abrufbare Daten zugreifen darf», kommentiert Klaus Breyer. Er ist Chief Technology und Chief Product Officer beim Influencer-Marketing-Technologie-Anbieter Buzzbird. Im Gegensatz zu zahlreichen anderen Analyse-Plattformen und Tool-Entwicklern hat sein Unternehmen nicht mit den Konsequenzen der Beschränkung zu kämpfen. Denn es gibt zwei unterschiedliche Wege, wie Informationen zu Analyse- oder Monitoring-Anbietern gelangen.\n\nBei der einen Variante, auf die auch Buzzbird setzt, holt der Entwickler von jedem Nutzer per Opt-in die Einwilligung ein, Daten sammeln, analysieren und auswerten zu dürfen. Das heisst: Es liegt eine eindeutige Einverständniserklärung des Nutzers zur Verwendung der Daten vor. Bei der anderen Variante nutzen Entwickler ihren Facebook- oder Instagram-Account, um allgemein zugängliche Nutzerdaten systematisch abzufischen. «Diese Dienste durchforschen öffentlich verfügbare Daten auf Instagram anonym, ohne die Nutzer zu fragen», sagt Breyer und ergänzt: «Dabei handelt es sich um ein fragwürdiges Modell, das zudem gegen die Geschäftsbedingungen verstösst.»\n\nVon der Daten-Pipeline abgeschnitten\n\nSolche Auswertungsmethoden will Facebook mit einer stärkeren Kontrolle von Apps und Schnittstellen erschweren. Von der neuen Zugriffsbeschränkung sind beispielsweise die Analyse- und Monitoring-Firmen Social Blade, Deep Social, Influencer DB sowie Brandwatch und Botcast AI betroffen. Zahlreiche Tool-Anbieter und Service-Dienstleister, die von der Daten-Pipeline abgeschnitten wurden, hoffen, dass Facebook die Beschränkungen revidiert.\n\nFelix Hummel, Kollege von Klaus Breyer und Geschäftsführer von Buzzbird, glaubt nicht, dass das passieren wird: «Das ist ein langfristiger Kurs, der zu besseren Inhalten, weniger Bots und mehr Datenschutz auf Facebook und Instagram führen soll.» Auch die Aussagen von Facebook sind relativ eindeutig. Der Massnahmenkatalog stellt demnach lediglich einen ersten Schritt dar. «Wir werden weitere Veränderungen in den kommenden Monaten vornehmen», sagt Facebook-CTO Mike Schroepfer.",

    "article_text": "Facebook told CNN it is looking into ties between one of its current employees and Cambridge Analytica, the controversial data firm that worked for Donald Trump's presidential campaign and was suspended by Facebook on Friday.\n\nJoseph Chancellor, now a researcher at Facebook (FB), was a director of Global Science Research, a company that provided data to Cambridge Analytica. The New York Times and The Observer newspaper in London reported Saturday that Cambridge Analytica harvested information on 50 million Facebook users.\n\nThe revelations have prompted renewed scrutiny of how Facebook was used to reach and influence voters ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.\n\n\"Joseph Chancellor is an employee of Facebook. We are looking into the situation,\" a spokesperson for Facebook told CNN.\n\nOn Friday, Facebook announced it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and data scientist Aleksandr Kogan, Chancellor's former business colleague, from using its platform while it investigates.\n\nRelated: Facebook is again having to account for its role in the 2016 election\n\nFacebook said in a blog post that Kogan \"lied to us\" and \"violated\" its policies in 2015 \"by passing data\" to a third party, including Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe nature of Chancellor's role as a director of Global Science Research and his knowledge of Kogan's data collection practices are not clear. A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica said \"there was no recollection of any interactions or emails with\" Chancellor.\n\nFacebook didn't mention Global Science Research in its blog post. But Cambridge Analytica said Saturday that it contracted the company in 2014 to \"undertake a large scale research project in the United States.\"\n\nGlobal Science Research was incorporated in May 2014 and listed Kogan and Chancellor as directors, according to UK government records. (The records show that Global Science Research was dissolved in October 2017.)\n\nRelated: New York professor sues Cambridge Analytics to find out what it knows about him\n\nNeither Kogan nor Chancellor have responded to CNN's requests for comment through email and social media. In addition, Facebook has not replied to a request that it ask Chancellor for comment.\n\nOn his work profile, Chancellor describes himself as a quantitative social psychologist.\n\nKogan and Chancellor were both at the University of Cambridge when they set up Global Science Research, according to their LinkedIn profiles.\n\nThe UK government records show Chancellor left Global Science Research in September 2015. According to his LinkedIn profile, he joined Facebook in November 2015.\n\nA spokesperson for Cambridge University told CNN that Kogan, who still works for the university, assured them \"that none of the data from his academic research was transferred for commercial use.\" Cambridge University could not immediately say if it asked Chancellor for similar assurances.\n\nThe data on Facebook users was gathered through a survey app called \"thisisyourdigitallife.\" According to the Cambridge University spokesperson, the app was developed by Global Science Research.\n\nThe Cambridge spokesperson said Kogan told the university that the app made clear it was for commercial, and not academic, research.\n\nBut Facebook disputes that point. Facebook provided CNN with the description it said Kogan gave them about the app in 2014.\n\nRelated: Facebook bans far right group Britain First\n\n\"This app is part of a research program in the Department of Psychology at the University of Cambridge,\" the description stated. \"We are using this app for research purposes - learning about how people's Facebook behaviour can be used to better understand their psychological traits, well-being, health, etc and overcome classic problems in social science. Users of the app will be presented with a description of the types of data we gather and the scientific purpose of the data.\"\n\nThe description continued, \"Users will be informed that the data will be carefully protected and never used for commercial purposes.\"\n\nWhile Kogan's collection of the data complied with Facebook policy, how he allegedly shared the data was not. Facebook said it ordered Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to delete the data when it determined Kogan had breached its policies in 2015.\n\nFacebook would not say if Chancellor also had access to the data and if he was asked to delete it.",

    "article_text": "The former boss of Cambridge Analytica has claimed his company has been “victimised” by a liberal backlash against Brexit and the election of Donald Trump.\n\nAlexander Nix was suspended as the data analysis firm’s chief executive after being filmed discussing the use of prostitutes and bribes in honey-traps to discredit politicians, and later resigned amid claims of the misuse of Facebook users’ personal information in the Trump campaign.\n\nGiving evidence to a parliamentary committee, he admitted he was”foolish” to be captured in what he described as a “very well-organised sting” by Channel 4 News (C4N).\n\nBut he insisted CA had never carried out the kind of unethical activities he discussed with an undercover reporter posing as a potential client, telling MPs it was “just a lie to impress the people I was talking to”.\n\nAnd he dismissed as a “point-blank lie” the claims of whistle-blowing former CA employee Christopher Wyle that the company had played a pivotal role in delivering Brexit.\n\nIn a mammoth three-and-a-half hour evidence session in the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s inquiry into fake news, Mr Nix dismissed Mr Wylie as a “bitter and jealous” individual who had “bombarded” CA with allegations after leaving the company – many of which had proved to be false.\n\nAlexander Nix was giving evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee inquiry into fake news for the second time (PA)\n\nBut he said the Electoral Commission had found there was no contract with Leave.EU, CA did no paid work for and had no impact on the group’s referendum campaign.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn one of a series of clashes with committee members, Mr Nix accused Ian Lucas of “building a conspiracy theory” after the Labour MP said his assertion that CA had nothing to do with Brexit was “complete nonsense”.\n\n“I’m sorry if members of this committee are unhappy with the outcome of the referendum, I’m sorry if members of the committee are unhappy with Donald Trump being President of the United States,” said a clearly angry Mr Nix.\n\n“But you can’t simply put forward your prejudices onto me and make sweeping assumptions about our involvement with a political campaign simply because that is what you want to believe… The fact is there is no evidence to support your position.”\n\nMr Lucas retorted: “Facts are what we are presenting to you. What we are getting back from you is bluster and rudeness.”\n\nAdvertising\n\nFormer Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie has made wide-ranging allegations about the company’s activities (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\nBut he asked the MPs: “What happens if none of that is actually true?”\n\nHe suggested Mr Wylie had provided ammunition for the “global liberal media” after they “decided to put us in their cross-hairs” because of CA’s perceived role in the Trump and Brexit victories and launched “an extremely well co-ordinated and effective attack on us as a company and destroyed our reputations and our business”.\n\nHe told them: “If you were sitting where I am right now, you would probably feel quite victimised.”\n\nMr Nix was returning to the committee for a second grilling, after his evidence to a February hearing was thrown into question by subsequent events, including the C4N broadcast in March.\n\nHe admitted his answers to the committee at the earlier hearing about Facebook data it received from Global Science Research (GSR) – a company set up by Cambridge University academic Dr Aleksandr Kogan – “could have been clearer” but insisted it was not his intention to mislead.\n\nHe told MPs he thought he was being asked whether CA held data from GSR at the time of the hearing, but later realised the question was whether it had ever held such information.\n\nMr Nix claimed he and CA colleague Mark Turnbull had been “over-zealous” in trying to secure a contract from a potential client when they were filmed discussing how pretty Ukrainian women could be used to lure rival politicians into compromising positions.\n\nInsisting his remarks were “hypothetical”, he accused C4N of heavily editing them and removing caveats in order to cast CA in the worst possible light.\n\n“We have never undertaken any work that involves a honey-trap or the use of a sex scandal or anything like that, or tried to create a sex scandal for political leverage or work on a campaign,” he told MPs.\n\nBut the broadcaster hit back, branding his claim that caveats were edited out as “wholly untrue”, and pointing out he had described the activities not only as “examples of what can be done” but also “what has been done”.\n\n“The Channel 4 News footage also shows that the suggestions to entrap politicians with bribes and honeytraps were not solicited by our reporter but were both raised first by Mr Nix and Mr Turnbull,” said C4N.\n\nMr Nix declined to say whether he had taken eight million US dollars out of CA shortly before its collapse, but insisted a Financial Times article carrying the allegation was based on inaccurate information.\n\nHe insisted in fact he had paid millions from his own pocket to cover staff salaries, bonuses and redundancies.\n\nHe said he had “absolutely no knowledge” of allegations that former CA director Brittany Kaiser visited Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in the Ecuadorean embassy and channelled him donations in crypto-currencies.\n\nAnd he insisted it was correct for him to say at his previous hearing that CA had no relationship with Canadian data firm AggregateIQ, as it had not worked with them for a period of “many months” at that point.",

    "article_text": "Thousands of people have pledged to shutdown their Facebook profiles following the revelations over the weekend\n\nFacebook has suspended data analysis and marketing firm Cambridge Analytica following claims that it breached an agreement with the social-media website when it used an ostensibly academic app to harvest data on 50 million users.\n\nIt follows revelations over the weekend by whistleblower Chris Wylie, a former contractor at Cambridge Analytica who went on to found his own, similar company.\n\nThose claims were published in The Observer and The New York Times. The newspapers claim that Cambridge Analytica obtained the Facebook data via an app built by Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan.\n\nThrough his company Global Science Research, in collaboration with Cambridge Analytica, Kogan built an app called 'thisisyourdigitallife' that paid hundreds of thousands of Facebook users to take a personality test and agree to have their data collected for academic use.\n\nThe app, however, also collected the information of the test-takers' Facebook friends, something allowed by Facebook until 2015, which lead to the accumulation of a data pool \"tens of millions-strong\".\n\nKogan, who worked with Wylie to obtain the data, then sold the information to Cambridge Analytica, according to The Observer, a move that went against Facebook's 'platform policy' that only allowed for the collection of friends' data to improve the user experience.\n\n\"We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on,\" Wylie, former research director at Cambridge Analytica, said.\n\nThis data was then turned into information used by the likes of Steve Bannon and the Donald Trump Campaign to \"micro-target\" individuals based on shared characteristics.\n\nThe Observer describes this as one of Facebook's \"biggest ever data breaches\" with the stolen information used \"to build a powerful software program to predict and influence choices at the ballot box\".\n\nDocuments seen by the newspaper show that Facebook knew about the \"unprecedented\" data harvesting by late-2015, but failed to alert users and took only \"limited steps\" to recover and secure the private information.\n\nIn response to the revelations, Facebook announced that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and Kogan from the platform, pending further information over misuse of data.\n\nCambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing and says that its parent company Strategic Communication Laboratories [SCL] hired Kogan to undertake \"a large-scale research project in the US\", none of which was used in the firm's 2016 election work.\n\nFacebook said in a statement that \"the claim that this is a data breach is completely false\". It added: \"Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent.\n\n\"People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\"\n\nThat isn't going to stop the firm from facing investigations, though, with both the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner's Office announcing on Saturday that they would be looking into whether Facebook data had been \"illegally acquired and used\".\n\nInformation Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said: \"We are investigating the circumstances in which Facebook data may have been illegally acquired and used.\n\n\"It's part of our ongoing investigation into the use of data analytics for political purposes which was launched to consider how political parties and campaigns, data analytics companies and social media platforms in the UK are using and analysing people's personal information to micro-target voters.\"\n\nIn the US, Massachusetts attorney general Maura Healey also announced her office is opening an investigation into the social networking site.",

Facebook said Kogan claimed the data would only be used for academic purposes but Facebook said Kogan \"lied to us\" and passed the content to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nBut Kogan told \"60 Minutes\" he didn't think obtaining the data for a political consulting firm was against Facebook's rules.\n\n\"The belief in Silicon Valley and certainly our belief ... was that the general public must be aware that their data is being sold and shared and used to advertise to them,\" Kogan said. \"And nobody cares.\"\n\nIn retrospect, Kogan said he believes his assumptions were misguided and therefore what he did in 2014 \"was not right and was not wise.\" But he insists it was business as usual at the time.\n\nAccording to the University of Cambridge's website, Kogan received his undergraduate degree at the University of California, Berkeley, and completed his Ph.D. at the University of Hong Kong. He was then a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Toronto before joining the University of Cambridge as a lecturer in 2012.\n\nIn March, the university said it was aware of the privacy scandal surrounding Kogan who now works as a senior research associate with the university's psychology department.\n\n\"The University of Cambridge takes matters of research integrity and data protection extremely seriously,\" it said. \"We have to date found no evidence to contradict Dr Kogan's previous assurances; nevertheless, we have written to Facebook to request all relevant evidence in their possession.\"",

Let’s call it the beginning of a cheat sheet on “digital anthropology.”\n\nI led a study of digital trust across 42 countries. We measured trust in four ways: users’ attitudes toward technology and related companies; users’ behaviors and tolerance for “frictions” in completing digital transactions; the trustworthiness of the digital infrastructure; and users’ overall experience. We discovered great differences in how much consumers trust the digital companies, the media they read online, and how their personal information is handled by internet companies.\n\nLove Undark?

Email *\n\nIn countries that are generally not as advanced digitally but moving up the curve quickly — such as Malaysia, Colombia, India, and Indonesia — users appear more trusting. In general, they are more willing to tolerate “frictions” in their digital experience, either because of poorer network quality or delays in completing digital financial transactions.\n\nIn many more advanced countries, trust in technology is low and falling. In a 2014 Pew survey, for example, only 11 percent of Americans were very or somewhat confident that social media and digital video sites were capable of keeping their data secure and private.\n\nIn the past couple of years, attitudes across 28 developed countries such as the U.S. have worsened. Trust in the media is at an all-time low of 43 percent.\n\nConsumers around the world also vary widely in the level of privacy that they would prefer or find acceptable. In response to a Pew survey question, 85 percent of Germans favored the more stringent European data privacy standards, while only 29 percent of American respondents felt the same.\n\nLet’s look again at the less technologically evolved, but rapidly developing countries — the countries that appear to trust the internet more. It turns out that these countries also tend to have less trustworthy digital environments. Infrastructure is underdeveloped and limited, with poorer security protections, particularly when it comes to user data in financial transactions.\n\nOther than China, an outlier in this group, these countries are the biggest growth opportunities for digital players such as Facebook. These markets are growing quickly, particularly on mobile devices, and represent some of the world’s largest populations. These traits are all critical for companies that rely on a mobile advertising-based business model. Mobile advertising accounted for more than 90 percent of Facebook’s revenue growth since 2012 and delivers 88 percent of its current revenues. In 2017, the company made over $40 billion in revenue.\n\nOf the top 10 countries with the most Facebook users, only two are digitally highly evolved. These two nations, the U.S. and the U.K., collectively account for 13 percent of all Facebook users. The remaining eight account for 41 percent of all Facebook users. What’s more, of the top 10 cities with the largest number of active Facebook users as of July 2017, all are in the digitally less evolved world.\n\nNot every society leans on the internet in the same way or for the same needs.\n\nConsider the recent concerns about “fake news” on social media. In the majority of the 38 countries studied in the Pew Spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey, at least a quarter of the population got its news from social media.\n\nThat said, the patterns of dependence vary widely. In Indonesia, no one aged 50 years and above reported getting news from social media. In South Korea, 45 percent of people in the age bracket do. Some countries, like Vietnam, exhibit a massive digital generation gap: There, over 80 percent of those aged 18 to 29 get their news from social media, versus just 3 percent of those over 50.\n\nShare this story!\n\nAlso, users in a given country can vary widely in the basic ways they behave on social media, depending on factors like economic status and gender. For example, according to one study, more women prefer to use profile pictures and spend more time than men looking at pages of others of their gender.\n\nSince the way people receive their news varies so widely across demographic strata and geographies, fixing the fake news problem will not be easy. Neither will it be easy to address concerns over how personal data is used, as in the Cambridge Analytica case. What may look like inadequate control and oversight in some parts of the world may be considered an overreach in others.\n\nZuckerberg is catching up with the uncomfortable fact that the ultimate social network he invented is making connections that he may not ever have imagined.\n\nWhatever solutions the good folks at Facebook devise — or have thrust upon them by regulators and lawmakers — must work not just for the more recently outraged American or the already skeptical European user. The solutions must work for the world from where Facebook picked up its second billion users, and is looking to pick up its third.\n\nSince Facebook depends entirely on advertising revenue, it cannot institute total data privacy measures throughout all its markets in one fell swoop.\n\nCambridge Analytica has its tentacles in elections in lands far beyond the U.S. According to the case studies on its website, it has played a role in crucial elections in India and Kenya, as well as Colombia, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Africa, and Thailand. All of these are countries coming up the digital evolution curve. If you were worried about the “Facebook effect” on American elections, just imagine the potential for mischief across these highly vulnerable countries.\n\nSince Facebook depends entirely on advertising revenue, it cannot institute total data privacy measures throughout all its markets in one fell swoop. This might throttle its ability to accumulate and monetize as much data as possible on its users. Despite the contrite messages today and promises to fix things from Facebook, to maintain its business model, the company will have to be more selective in where it applies more stringent data privacy standards. In my view, it’s likely to institute measures calibrated to be just “good enough” for the context.\n\nIt’s too bad that Zuckerberg is getting his deferred liberal arts education in digital anthropology at some cost to 2 billion and counting users, as well as democratic institutions around the world. I can only hope that he is a quick study.\n\nBhaskar Chakravorti is the senior associate dean of international business and finance at Tuft University’s Fletcher School and and the founding executive director of Fletcher’s Institute for Business in the Global Context.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

    "article_text": "LONDON -- The former head of Cambridge Analytica said Wednesday that his political consulting firm got \"an incredibly huge target\" on its back because of its involvement in President Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. Alexander Nix said his now-defunct firm had become the subject of global derision and was unfairly blamed for putting Mr. Trump in office.\n\nThe remarks came as an unrepentant Nix clashed with British lawmakers investigating the use of Facebook data in election campaigns. The Parliament's media committee sought his testimony to clarify his previous remarks. While lawmakers had once listened with rapt attention as former employee Christopher Wylie discussed how the Facebook material was gathered and used by the firm, they grew visibly impatient with Nix, who challenged their questions.\n\nThe sheer tone of the hearing was unusual, marked at times by exchanges that seemed somewhat personal. Nix repeatedly suggested that lines of questioning were politically motivated, such as when Ian Lucas, a Labour lawmaker, challenged Nix's claim that the firm had nothing to do with the campaign supporting Britain's departure from the European Union.\n\n\"I'm sorry if members of this committee are unhappy with the outcome of the referendum. I'm sorry if members of the committee are unhappy with Donald Trump being president of the United States,\" Nix replied. \"But you can't simply put forward your prejudices onto me and make sweeping assumptions about our involvement with a political campaign simply because that is what you want to believe, because that narrative suits your view of the facts.\"\n\nLucas retorted: \"Facts are what we are presenting to you. What we are getting back from you is bluster and rudeness.\"\n\nMr. Trump was one of Cambridge Analytica's customers, though the firm has insisted that none of the Facebook data was used in his 2016 campaign.\n\nNix acknowledged he should have been clearer when asked at an earlier hearing whether his firm had Facebook data through Global Science Research, a company that collected data from users in the guise of a personality test. Nix said he should have said \"yes\" but that his \"focus was on whether we still held the data from GSR, which was the issue Facebook had been most concerned about.\" He said the data was deleted at Facebook's request.\n\nNix also said he's embarrassed at having been caught on camera boasting that he could entrap political figures by compromising them with bribes and Ukrainian women. But he insisted he was entrapped by unscrupulous, undercover journalists from Channel 4 News -- a claim the news organization rejected.\n\nMeanwhile, Nix was accused on Wednesday of taking $8 million from the company ahead of its recent collapse, CNET reported. Investors backing a rebrand of the data consultancy firm are currently in a stand-off with Nix while trying to persuade him to return the money, according to the Financial Times. Nix is accused of taking the money shortly after British journalists began reporting on the company's involvement in the mishandling of Facebook users' personal data.\n\nDuring the session in Parliament on Wednesday, he denied he took the money.\n\n\"The allegation made in that article is false, the facts in that article are not correct,\" said Nix, who did not respond to CNET's request for comment.",

who is in attendance - had been the \"single source\" for most of the accusations made against Cambridge Analytica.\n\nThe committee's chairman challenged this claim.\n\nThe company is now in administration and Mr Nix told MPs he had invested \"millions of dollars\" of his personal fortune in the last few months to pay the salaries and redundancies of staff.\n\nHe also said he was \"deeply embarrassed\" about an undercover Channel 4 News report in which he discussed questionable methods - including sending \"Ukrainian girls\" to a candidate's home - that might be used to gain clients.\n\nMr Nix said he had used \"hyperbole\", admitting his claims had a \"significant impact\" on the firm he ran.\n\nBut he claimed that the footage had been edited to misrepresent the context of his words, and that Cambridge Analytica would not have engaged in such tactics itself.\n\nChannel 4 News has told the BBC that this was \"wholly untrue\".\n\nIn particular, it took issue with Mr Nix's assertion that it had misled viewers by editing out him saying: \"Please don't pay too much attention to what I'm saying, they're just examples of what can be done.\"\n\n\"What Mr Nix actually said to our reporter and which was broadcast by Channel 4 News and watched by over three million people was that his caveat 'they're just examples of what can be done' was followed by 'and what has been done...',\" it said.\n\n\"Further his comments about entrapment to our reporter were not solicited by our undercover reporter, and his comments about using 'Ukrainian girls' were made unprompted.\n\n\"The Channel 4 News footage also shows that the suggestions to entrap politicians with bribes and honeytraps were not solicited by our reporter but were both raised first by Mr Nix and Mr Turnbull.\"\n\nToothpaste\n\nMr Nix also denied that two election videos made for Nigeria and Kenya, which contained what he called \"unethical media content\", had anything to do with Cambridge Analytica.\n\n\"I know the media wants to see us as this nefarious multi-national that influences politics around the world but the truth is that we are a very small advertising agency that works across a series of sectors,\" he said.\n\nHe added that political work had made up just 25% of what his firm had done.\n\n\"Most of our time is spent selling toothpaste and automotives,\" he said.\n\nTowards the end of the session, Mr Nix became emotional, accusing the committee of believing \"conspiracy theories\" and making \"sweeping assumptions\".\n\nHe said that he felt \"victimised\" by their questioning and the media furore that had engulfed him in the last few months.\n\nAnd he claimed that his firm had been victim of an effort to force a second Brexit referendum by what he said were false claims that it had been involved in the first one.\n\nCarole Cadwalladr -

    "article_text": "The bigger picture\n\nGoogle has been in the sights of the E.U. for some time. Last year, Ms. Vestager’s commission levied a record $2.7 billion fine over the company’s shopping comparison service. That didn’t do much to dent Google’s core businesses, but the Android case might be a different matter.\n\nBut in pursuing a business so core to Google’s future, Ms. Vestager is again taking bold action against one of Silicon Valley’s most powerful titans. (Remember that she ordered Ireland to reclaim more than $15 billion in back taxes from Apple.)\n\nOne last question: Will investors care? So far, shares in Google’s parent, Alphabet, were down less than 1 percent after the FT story was published. Its market value: almost $789 billion.\n\n— Michael de la Merced\n\nPhoto\n\nThe odds of Athenahealth getting sold just got much higher\n\nThe electronic medical records company just ousted its C.E.O., Jonathan Bush, after a series of new revelations came to light about allegations made against him over inappropriate behavior at the workplace and domestic abuse.\n\nWhen a company undergoes a changeover in its leadership, that often raises the chances of it ultimately selling itself — especially when an activist investor like Elliott Management is knocking on the door, as it is here. (Elliott has offered to buy the company for about $6.9 billion, including debt.) Some shareholders, like Clearbridge Investments, have urged the company to start exploring “strategic alternatives.”\n\nAthenahealth acknowledged that this was possible. From a statement by its executive chairman, Jeff Immelt, on Wednesday:\n\nTo ensure athenahealth maximizes shareholder value and is best positioned to realize the full potential of its premier health care technology platform, the board has authorized a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale or merger or continuing as an independent company under new leadership.\n\nThe context\n\nOver the past two weeks, Mr. Bush (Athenahealth’s co-founder, and a cousin of George W. Bush) had taken fire for a variety of disclosures about his conduct, both at the workplace and at home.\n\n• The Daily Mail reported that the executive had been accused of punching his then-wife as part of a 2006 custody battle. Mr. Bush told the publication, “‘I take complete responsibility for all these regrettable incidents involving my dear former wife.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n• Bloomberg reported on other allegations, including a 2009 complaint by an Athenahealth employee who described a “sexually hostile environment” at the company.\n\nIn an unusual statement on Wednesday, Mr. Bush said of his exit:\n\n“I believe that working for something larger than yourself is the greatest thing a human can do. A family, a cause, a company, a country – these things give shape and purpose to an otherwise mechanical and brief human existence. athenahealth is a near once in a life time example of such a thing. With that lens on, it’s easy for me to see that the very things that made me useful to the company and cause in these past twenty-one years, are now exactly the things that are in the way. I cannot imagine a single organization more loaded with potential to transform health care.”\n\nWhat happens now\n\nAthenahealth has the investment banks Lazard and Centerview Partners and the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges advising it on a potential sale.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Immelt — the former G.E. chief who joined the company in February, and whose entrance Mr. Bush told me was like scoring “a decade’s worth of guitar lessons from Elvis” — became executive chairman. Marc Levine, the company’s C.F.O., is taking a more hands-on role in daily operations.\n\nElliott’s response to the news\n\nFrom a spokesman:\n\n“Elliott welcomes the Board’s decision to explore strategic alternatives and believes it is the right one for athenahealth’s shareholders, employees and customers. We have long believed that athenahealth is a great company, and we look forward to participating as a bidder in the company’s strategic exploration process.”\n\n— Michael J. de la Merced\n\nAlexander Nix, the former Cambridge Analytica C.E.O., just got grilled by British lawmakers\n\nMembers of the British government’s digital, culture, media, and sports committee tried to catch him out with questions about a series of media reports on Cambridge Analytica, but they didn’t seem to unsettle the ex-C.E.O.\n\nThings didn’t start well for Mr. Nix. He argued with Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, about whether he was allowed to give an opening statement to provide “few clarifications” about what happened when he last testified before the same panel. He wasn’t.\n\nHere are some choice interactions from the rest of the hearing:\n\nDid Mr. Nix take $8 million from the consulting firm before it collapsed, as the FT reported this morning?\n\n“The allegation is false, the facts are not correct.”\n\nWhat about reports that suggested that Cambridge Analytica removed items from its offices, before the British government’s Information Commissioner’s Office searched the premises?\n\n“Those boxes were not ours. As far as I’m aware, the I.C.O. were the only people to remove documents, files and hardware from that office.”\n\nDid Cambridge Analytica techniques such as bribery, honey traps and extortion to help nations win elections, as Mr. Nix claimed in secret recording made by the British broadcaster Channel 4?\n\n“I didn’t represent the company properly, I didn’t represent what we do. In our overzealousness to secure a contract, Mark Turnbull and I were guilty of hyperbole of agreeing on matters that, not only had we never done, but we had no understanding of. We were telling a client what we thought he wanted to hear.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDid Mr. Nix mean to mislead the politicians during his last hearing (in February, before the Cambridge Analytica scandal exploded)? Then, one member of the committee asked about Cambridge Analytica’s possession of data obtained from Global Science Research, which has been originally gathered from Facebook users.\n\n“It was my firm impression that Mr. Collins’ questions were about whether we were currently in possession of the data… so I answered no.” “When I read the transcript, it became clear that Mr. Collins was also asking whether we had ever held it. Clearly the answer should have been yes. The fact that we received data from G.S.R. was already in the public domain from as early as December 2015, when the Guardian published an article.” “I also stand by my evidence that we do not work on Facebook data and we do not have Facebook data. That data was given by G.S.R., and subsequently deleted at Facebook’s request.”\n\nHow useful was the Facebook data to Cambridge Analytica, which was used to inform the company’s work in the U.S.?\n\n“That data was less useful than simply using Facebook’s own advertising algorithms.”\n\n— Jamie Condliffe\n\nPhoto\n\nDid national security take a back seat in Facebook’s data sharing?\n\nAn NYT investigation shows that the Chinese hardware manufacturer Huawei, which has a cozy relationship with Beijing, was one of four Chinese companies that Facebook gave access to its users’ personal data.\n\nMore from Michael LaForgia and Gabriel J.X. Dance:\n\nFacebook officials said the agreements with the Chinese companies allowed them access similar to what was offered to BlackBerry, which could retrieve detailed information on both device users and all of their friends — including religious and political leanings, work and education history and relationship status.\n\nAccording to Facebook, the user data stayed on phones and never reached those companies’ servers. Lawmakers are irate anyway: Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that he will “look forward to learning more about how Facebook ensured that.”\n\nElsewhere in Facebook news: A new Apple privacy feature will let Safari users block tracking by “like” buttons.

The bureau canceled a meeting scheduled for February, and last week it canceled one planned for this week.\n\nAnthony Welcher, who, as one of Mr. Mulvaney’s deputies, oversees external affairs for the bureau, told those members of the board, which now numbers 25, that it would be reconstituted as a smaller group.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe consumer advisory board’s members are consumer activists, academics, entrepreneurs who run financial start-ups and industry representatives from companies including Citi, Discover, and Mastercard.\n\nThe government should be more vocal about A.I. to maintain its global lead\n\nThe White House has said that it plans to help A.I. researchers develop better artificial intelligence systems by making government data available to researchers to help them. But the nation remains at risk of being overtaken as a global A.I. leader, as other nation states appear to value the technology more highly.\n\nAccess to high-quality data underpins most of the recent successes in artificial intelligence, as the software is trained to identify patterns by studying huge quantities of historical information, whether its images, text or something else entirely. Now, MIT Technology Review reports that Michael Kratsios, President Trump’s chief technology adviser, has vowed to help the research community by releasing information to it:\n\n“Anything that we can do to unlock government data, we’re committed to. We’d love to hear from any academic that has any insights.”\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story The All-New DealBook Newsletter Our columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.

That’s perhaps not too surprising. Along with robotics, A.I. is part of the automation trend that could erode many jobs in America — so encouraging its development could be seen as running contra to Mr. Trump’s election pledges.\n\nSo far, a big part of the administration’s approach to giving A.I. research a push has focused on removing regulatory barriers so that industry can apply the technology more quickly. It also says that it’s increased investment in R.&D. for “A.I. and related technologies” by more than 40 percent since 2015 — though it’s not clear what those “related technologies” are.\n\nOther nations are making A.I. pushes: Countries such as Britain and France have published ambitious A.I. policies that put in place funding, education, and governance initiatives. Large American tech firms are setting up bases there, where a lot of their fundamental A.I. research takes place. Facebook has a large lab in Paris, for instance, and Google’s DeepMind is based in London.\n\nChina and Russia have also been outspoken in their desire to be dominant powers in artificial intelligence. In fact, China is already giving America a run for its A.I money: It published more patents and academic articles relating to the technology than the U.S. did in 2017.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nA big problem for America: Such enthusiasm about A.I. overseas is already luring academics away from the U.S. Most notably, Geoffrey Hinton, an early pioneer of machine learning, has relocated to Toronto to run a Google research center. Other high-profile academics could follow his lead, and Mr. Trump’s immigration rules might make it harder for foreign talent to replace them.\n\nMaintaining an edge in artificial intelligence will be incredibly valuable for America. The direct benefits to the economy are huge, if difficult to accurately predict. And the technology is more important than just that, as it will form a huge part of the nation’s military and security operations over the coming years (just ask Google). But until the Trump administration starts making more noise — and bigger policy moves — about A.I. being a priority, it runs the risk of losing first place in the race.\n\n— Jamie Condliffe\n\nPhoto\n\nZTE may soon be rescued. What the U.S. gets in return? Unclear.\n\nThe White House and Beijing are said to be near a deal to save ZTE, one in which the embattled Chinese telecom company would pay a fine of more than $1.4 billion. But it isn’t apparent what else the U.S. would get for pardoning a company that Washington views as an arm of Beijing.\n\nLawmakers like Senator Chuck Schumer were infuriated:\n\nPhoto\n\nMany commentators reckon the ZTE talks are aimed at wringing trade concessions from China, though the Trump administration insists otherwise. And China has reportedly offered to buy $70 billion worth of agricultural, energy and industrial products if the U.S. drops its threat of tariffs. But some people in the administration doubt that proposal.\n\nElsewhere in trade\n\n• Mexico imposed $3 billion worth of tariffs on American goods like pork and cheese in response to Mr. Trump’s tariff on imported metals.\n\n• As the Nafta talks sputter, the White House is seeking separate trade deals with Canada and Mexico.\n\n• Senator Bob Corker wants Congress to have the power to block tariffs.\n\nPhoto\n\nThe messy Comcast-Disney battle hits Britain\n\nRupert Murdoch is going to face Comcast in a bidding war for one of Europe’s pay-TV crown jewels, Sky. The U.K. government has cleared 21st Century Fox to bid for full control of the satellite broadcaster — so long as it sells Sky News to Disney, or someone else.\n\nBut something bigger is at work. Comcast is also challenging Disney’s $52.4 billion bid for most of Fox, which includes 39 percent of Sky. (Got all that?) If Comcast could buy the 61 percent of Sky that Fox doesn’t already own, it would be a considerable blow to the Disney deal. Oh, and Comcast is expected to fight hard for the other Fox assets that Disney wants, too.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe only sure winners?

Both were rejected by “a wide margin.”\n\nThen Mr. Musk wheeled out his hype machine.

    "article_text": "During a nearly four-hour grilling before Parliament Wednesday, Alexander Nix, former CEO of the now defunct data firm Cambridge Analytica, faced the ghosts of his past.\n\nIn the green-carpeted room where the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee interrogated Nix for the second time this year, the audience included Christopher Wylie, the former Cambridge Analytica employee who blew the whistle on the surreptitious harvesting of up to 87 million Facebook users' data; Carole Cadwalladr, the Guardian reporter who broke the story; Shahmir Sanni, another whistleblower who alleges that the Brexit VoteLeave campaign flouted campaign finance laws during the referendum; and David Carroll, an American academic who has filed a legal suit against Cambridge Analytica, seeking access to his personal data file.\n\nBut of all of the individuals who have challenged Nix over the last three months, the one whose words have gotten him in the most trouble may well be Nix himself. In February, just a month before the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke open in earnest, Nix testified before this very committee about Cambridge Analytica's work. Months later, following steady revelations about the company's misdeeds, the committee decided that Nix's initial answers were at best incomplete, and at worst, intentionally misleading.\n\n'By no stretch of the imagination can you be seen as the victim.' Brendan O'Hara, UK Parliament\n\nThe questioning started contentiously, as committee chairman Damian Collins declined to let Nix deliver an opening statement that he said would clarify misconceptions about his prior testimony. When Nix told the eight members gathered that he had to \"insist\" on giving the statement, Collins swiftly shut him down. \"I'm sorry, sir,\" Collins said. \"It’s not your place to insist.\"\n\nThroughout his testimony, Nix worked to frame himself as the target of an unfounded international smear campaign coordinated by an ex-employee with an axe to grind (Wylie), a British journalist who wanted to undo the Brexit referendum (Cadwalladr), and an American public that's already divided over President Donald Trump's election, which Cambridge Analytica helped enable.\n\n\"I'm sorry if the members of this committee are unhappy with the outcome of the referendum. I'm sorry if the members of the committee are unhappy with Donald Trump being President of the United States,\" he said. \"But you can’t simply put forward your prejudices onto me and make sweeping assumptions about our involvement with a particular campaign simply because that’s what you want to believe.\"\n\nThe members laughed in response.\n\n\"You have attempted to paint yourself as the victim,\" Brendan O'Hara, a member of the Scottish National Party, told Nix during the hearing. \"By no stretch of the imagination can you be seen as the victim.\"\n\nNix's inquisitors repeatedly asked him to address his past statements, including his assertion in February of this year that none of Cambridge Analytica's data came from Global Science Research, the third-party firm that Nix has since admitted collected Facebook data on Cambridge Analytica's behalf. Nix chalked up the assertion to a misunderstanding, saying that he believed the committee was asking him whether Cambridge Analytica was still using that data. \"Clearly I accept some of my answers could have been clearer, but I assure you, I did not intend to mislead you,\" he said. (In a 2015 interview with WIRED, Nix also stated that Cambridge Analytica did not use Facebook data or harvest it through a third party app, as reported in a story in The Guardian that year.)\n\nThe committee members asked Nix to answer for additional controversies that have arisen since he last appeared before them, including a damning undercover video captured by Channel 4 News, in which Nix was caught on tape bragging about using tactics like bribery and extortion against political opponents. In particular, they pressed him on his claims of using Ukrainian women to entrap politicians. \"I find that works very well,\" Nix said in the video.\n\nBut before the committee, he walked back those assertions: \"That was just a lie to impress the people I was talking to.\"\n\nNix argued the sting video was a dirty tactic, and that it had been edited to make him look worse. In response, Channel 4 issued a statement saying, \"We absolutely disagree and reject Mr. Nix's allegation.\"\n\n'You can’t simply put forward your prejudices onto me and make sweeping assumptions about our involvement with a particular campaign simply because that’s what you want to believe.' Alexander Nix\n\nSeveral committee members asked Nix about a report in the Financial Times, which said that Nix took $8 million from the company before it collapsed and is now in a standoff with investors over returning the funds. While Nix initially dismissed the report as baseless, he later told Labour MP Jo Stevens that he couldn't comment on the matter.\n\n\"Did you take $8 million out of the company?\" Stevens asked directly.\n\n\"The answer to your question is, I'm not answering your question,\" Nix replied.\n\nThe inconsistencies continued. Nix explained why he told the committee the company never worked with Russian clients, despite the fact that it had worked with the oil company Gazprom, by saying it happened before he joined. As for why he bragged about working with Israeli intelligence agents in the Channel 4 video, Nix said, \"I was totally mistaken.\"\n\nEven as he admitted to his own misstatements, he repeatedly accused Wylie of outright lying. He described him as an \"extremely jealous\" ex-employee who \"sat there and stewed as his baby grew.\" He said it was Wylie who introduced the company to Aleksandr Kogan, the third-party researcher who collected the Facebook data. \"He was the architect for that relationship and the idea,\" Nix said.\n\nThroughout his former boss's remarks, Wylie sat in the back row shaking his head at the allegations. The committee members also appeared unconvinced, calling Nix's attacks on Wylie irrelevant. Ultimately, even four hours of testimony seemed not to be enough to convince the committee to take Nix at his word.\n\n\"Facts are what we are presenting to you,\" said Labour MP Ian Lucas. \"What we are getting back from you is bluster and rudeness.\"\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

What we are getting back from you is bluster and rudeness.”\n\nFormer Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie has made wide-ranging allegations about the company’s activities (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\nMr Nix said that Mr Wylie had accused CA of working for Brexit, disseminating gruesomely violent videos in an African election, “capturing governments, colonising countries and being part of some right-wing conspiracy”.\n\nBut he asked the MPs: “What happens if none of that is actually true?”\n\nHe suggested Mr Wylie had provided ammunition for the “global liberal media” after they “decided to put us in their cross-hairs” because of CA’s perceived role in the Trump and Brexit victories and launched “an extremely well co-ordinated and effective attack on us as a company and destroyed our reputations and our business”.\n\nHe told them: “If you were sitting where I am right now, you would probably feel quite victimised.”\n\nMr Nix was returning to the committee for a second grilling, after his evidence to a February hearing was thrown into question by subsequent events, including the C4N broadcast in March.\n\nHe admitted his answers to the committee at the earlier hearing about Facebook data it received from Global Science Research (GSR) – a company set up by Cambridge University academic Dr Aleksandr Kogan – “could have been clearer” but insisted it was not his intention to mislead.\n\nHe told MPs he thought he was being asked whether CA held data from GSR at the time of the hearing, but later realised the question was whether it had ever held such information.\n\nMr Nix claimed he and CA colleague Mark Turnbull had been “over-zealous” in trying to secure a contract from a potential client when they were filmed discussing how pretty Ukrainian women could be used to lure rival politicians into compromising positions.\n\nInsisting his remarks were “hypothetical”, he accused C4N of heavily editing them and removing caveats in order to cast CA in the worst possible light.\n\n“We have never undertaken any work that involves a honey-trap or the use of a sex scandal or anything like that, or tried to create a sex scandal for political leverage or work on a campaign,” he told MPs.\n\nBut the broadcaster hit back, branding his claim that caveats were edited out as “wholly untrue”, and pointing out he had described the activities not only as “examples of what can be done” but also “what has been done”.\n\n“The Channel 4 News footage also shows that the suggestions to entrap politicians with bribes and honeytraps were not solicited by our reporter but were both raised first by Mr Nix and Mr Turnbull,” said C4N.\n\nMr Nix declined to say whether he had taken eight million US dollars out of CA shortly before its collapse, but insisted a Financial Times article carrying the allegation was based on inaccurate information.\n\nHe insisted in fact he had paid millions from his own pocket to cover staff salaries, bonuses and redundancies.\n\nHe said he had “absolutely no knowledge” of allegations that former CA director Brittany Kaiser visited Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in the Ecuadorean embassy and channelled him donations in crypto-currencies.\n\nAnd he insisted it was correct for him to say at his previous hearing that CA had no relationship with Canadian data firm AggregateIQ, as it had not worked with them for a period of “many months” at that point.\n\n- Press Association",

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull supported the call for Zuckerberg to fly more than 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) from Menlo Park in California to face lawmakers in Canberra.\n\n\"I would welcome Facebook coming and testifying before our parliamentary committees, yes,\" Turnbull told reporters. \"Of course, we'd love to see the boss.\"\n\nHuawei said Wednesday it has never collected or stored Facebook user data, after Facebook acknowledged it shared such data with Huawei and other manufacturers.\n\nHuawei, a company flagged by U.S. intelligence officials as a national security threat and barred on security grounds from involvement in Australia's National Broadband Network, was the latest device maker at the center of a fresh wave of allegations over Facebook's handling of private data.\n\nChinese firms Huawei, Lenovo, Oppo and TCL were among numerous handset makers that were given access to Facebook data in a \"controlled\" way approved by Facebook, according to a statement Tuesday from Francisco Varela, Facebook's vice president of mobile partnerships.\n\nFacebook said it would end its data partnership with Huawei by the end of this week.\n\nIt's the latest privacy gaffe for Facebook since allegations emerged in March that a Trump-affiliated political consultancy firm, Cambridge Analytica, had improperly harvested data of Facebook users in an effort to influence elections.\n\nThe Australian committee, like a court, can summons witnesses to give evidence, although it is questionable whether a witness outside Australia could be compelled to attend. In practice, committees always invite rather than compel witnesses to attend hearings.\n\nFacebook was asked by The Associated Press whether Zuckerberg would accept such an invitation.\n\nFacebook replied with a statement on Thursday: \"We will be providing the Australian government with more information about the device-integrated APIs,\" referring to Application Programming Interfaces that enable servers to communicate directly.\n\nThe committee's chairman Andrew Hastie and deputy chairman Anthony Byrne say Facebook owed answers to its 15 million Australian users.\n\n\"It is completely unacceptable that information from Facebook users has been slyly handed over to Huawei by Facebook,\" Byrne told The Australian newspaper. \"I want to know why Mr. Zuckerberg allowed this to happen. If need be, he will be invited to appear\" before the committee, Byrne added.\n\nByrne was not immediately available for comment on Thursday, but his office confirmed that he had been accurately quoted.\n\nZuckerberg has been called to give evidence to U.S. congressional committees and the European Parliament in recent months over user privacy breaches.\n\nCopyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Facebook estimated that nearly 201,000 people in Delaware were friends with those on the social media site who had installed the app.\n\nDenn said he later learned Global Science Research may have improperly shared that data with political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and other third parties.\n\nThe personal info of up to 87 million Facebook users worldwide may have been compromised, according to the company’s public disclosures.\n\n“Through that app, over 200,000 people in Delaware alone, just by virtue of being friends with those 900, may have had their personal data exposed. There’s a huge multiplier effect when you’re talking about social media,” said Denn.\n\nHe described the breach as a wake-up call to take a look at what social media has and shares about you.\n\nDenn is among 41 attorneys general who signed a March letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Collectively, they’re investigating the breach of personal privacy and whether it violated any state laws. The letter posed questions about whether Facebook’s privacy terms were clear or buried in boilerplate and what safeguards were in place to ensure third-party developers were not misusing users’ data.\n\n“This obviously raises much broader questions, though, beyond compliance with state law, just about how we want to operate on social media as a country and to what degree we want to allow people’s personal information to potentially be exposed in this way,” Denn said.\n\nShort of deleting your Facebook account, experts recommend deleting any unnecessary apps on your Facebook page – users can go to settings and click on “apps and settings,” to see the apps they have installed and click to delete any of them.\n\nIt’s also recommended that people do not use the option offered by many other websites to log in with their Facebook account, because that login allows data sharing between Facebook and the website or app.",

    "article_text": "A decade of apparent indifference for data privacy at Facebook has culminated in revelations that organizations harvested user data for targeted advertising, particularly political advertising, to apparent success. While the most well-known offender is Cambridge Analytica—the political consulting and strategic communication firm behind the pro-Brexit Leave.EU campaign, as well as Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign—other companies have likely used similar tactics to collect personal data of Facebook users.\n\nTechRepublic's cheat sheet about the Facebook data privacy scandal covers the ongoing controversy surrounding the illicit use of profile information. This article will be updated as more information about this developing story comes to the forefront.\n\nSEE: All TechRepublic cheat sheets and smart person's guides\n\nWhat is the Facebook data privacy scandal?\n\nThe Facebook data privacy scandal centers around the collection of personally identifiable information of \"up to 87 million people\" by the political consulting and strategic communication firm Cambridge Analytica. That company—and others—were able to gain access to personal data of Facebook users due to the confluence of a variety of factors, broadly including inadequate safeguards against companies engaging in data harvesting, little to no oversight of developers by Facebook, developer abuse of the Facebook API, and users agreeing to overly broad terms and conditions.\n\nSEE: Information security policy (Tech Pro Research)\n\nIn the case of Cambridge Analytica, the company was able to harvest personally identifiable information through a personality quiz app called thisisyourdigitiallife, based on the OCEAN personality model. Information gathered via this app is useful in building a \"psychographic\" profile of users (the OCEAN acronym stands for openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism). Adding the app to your Facebook account to take the quiz gives the creator of the app access to profile information and user history for the user taking the quiz, as well as all of the friends that user has on Facebook. This data includes all of the items that users and their friends have liked on Facebook.\n\nResearchers associated with Cambridge University claimed in a paper that it \"can be used to automatically and accurately predict a range of highly sensitive personal attributes including: sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious and political views, personality traits, intelligence, happiness, use of addictive substances, parental separation, age, and gender,\" with a model developed by the researchers that uses a combination of dimensionality reduction and logistic/linear regression to infer this information about users.\n\nThe model—according to the researchers—is effective due to the relationship of likes to a given attribute. However, most likes are not explicitly indicative of their attributes. The researchers note that \"less than 5% of users labeled as gay were connected with explicitly gay groups,\" but that liking \"Juicy Couture\" and \"Adam Lambert\" are likes indicative of gay men, while \"WWE\" and \"Being Confused After Waking Up From Naps\" are likes indicative of straight men. Other such connections are peculiarly lateral, with \"curly fries\" being an indicator of high IQ, \"sour candy\" being an indicator of not smoking, and \"Gene Wilder\" being an indicator the user's parents had not seperated by age 21.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWhat is the timeline of the Facebook data privacy scandal?\n\nFacebook has more than a decade-long track record of incidents highlighting inadequate and insufficient measures to protect data privacy. While the severity of these individual cases varies, the sequence of repeated failures paints a larger picture of systemic problems.\n\nIn 2005, researchers at MIT created a script that downloaded publicly posted information of over 70,000 users from four schools. (Facebook only began to allow search engines to crawl profiles in September 2007.)\n\nIn 2007, activities that users engaged in on other websites was automatically added to Facebook user profiles as part of Beacon, one of Facebook's first attempts to monetize user profiles. As an example, Beacon indicated on the Facebook News Feed the titles of videos that users rented from Blockbuster Video, which was a violation of the Video Privacy Protection Act. A class action suit was filed, for which Facebook paid $9.5 million to a fund for privacy and security as part of a settlement agreement.\n\nIn 2011, following an FTC investigation, the company entered into a consent decree, promising to address concerns about how user data was tracked and shared. That investigation was prompted by an incident in December 2009 in which information thought private by users was being shared publicly, according to contemporaneous reporting by The New York Times.\n\nIn 2013, Facebook disclosed details of a bug that exposed the personal details of six million accounts over approximately a year. When users downloaded their own Facebook history, that user would obtain in the same action not just their own address book, but also the email addresses and phone numbers of their friends that other people had stored in their address books. The data that Facebook exposed had not been given to Facebook by users to begin with—it had been vacuumed from the contact lists of other Facebook users who happen to know that person. This phenomenon has since been described as \"shadow profiles.\"\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica portion of the data privacy scandal starts in February 2014. A spate of reviews on the Turkopticon website—a third-party review website for users of Amazon's Mechanical Turk—detail a task requested by Aleksandr Kogan asking users to complete a survey in exchange for money. The survey required users to add the thisisyourdigitiallife app to their Facebook account, which is in violation of Mechanical Turk's terms of service. One review quotes the request as requiring users to \"provide our app access to your Facebook so we can download some of your data—some demographic data, your likes, your friends list, whether your friends know one another, and some of your private messages.\"\n\nIn December 2015, Facebook learned for the first time that the data set Kogan generated with the app was shared with Cambridge Analytica. Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg claims \"we immediately banned Kogan's app from our platform, and demanded that Kogan and Cambridge Analytica formally certify that they had deleted all improperly acquired data. They provided these certifications.\"\n\nAccording to Cambridge Analytica, the company took legal action in August 2016 against GSR (Kogan) for licensing \"illegally acquired data\" to the company, with a settlement reached that November.\n\nOn March 17, 2018, an exposé was published by the The Guardian and The New York Times, initially reporting that 50 million Facebook profiles were harvested by Cambridge Analytica; the figure was later revised to \"up to 87 million\" profiles. The exposé relies on information provided by Christopher Wylie, a former employee of SCL Elections and Global Science Research, the creator of the thisisyourdigitiallife app. Wylie claimed that the data from that app was sold to Cambridge Analytica, which used the data to develop \"psychographic\" profiles of users, and target users with pro-Trump advertising, a claim that Cambridge Analytica denied.\n\nOn March 16, 2018, Facebook threatened to sue The Guardian over publication of the story, according to a tweet by Guardian reporter Carole Cadwalladr. Campbell Brown, a former CNN journalist who now works as head of news partnerships at Facebook, said it was \"not our wisest move,\" adding \"If it were me I would have probably not threatened to sue The Guardian.\" Similarly, Cambridge Analytica threatened to sue The Guardian for defamation.\n\nWe have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. Mark Zuckerberg\n\nOn March 20, 2018, the FTC opened an investigation to determine if Facebook has violated the terms of the settlement from the 2011 investigation.\n\nIn April 2018, reports indicated that Facebook granted Zuckerberg and other high ranking executives powers over controlling personal information on the platform that are not available to normal users. Messages from Zuckerberg sent to other users were remotely deleted from users' inboxes, which the company claimed was part of a corporate security measure following the 2014 Sony Pictures hack. Facebook subsequently announced plans to make available the \"unsend\" capability \"to all users in several months,\" and that Zuckerberg will be unable to unsend messages until such time that feature rolls out.\n\nOn April 4, 2018, The Washington Post reported that Facebook announced \"malicious actors\" abused the search function to gather public profile information of \"most of its 2 billion users worldwide.\"\n\nIn a CBS News/YouGov poll published on April 10, 2018, 61% of Americans said Congress should do more to regulate social media and tech companies. This sentiment was echoed in a CBS News interview with Box CEO Aaron Levie and YML CEO Ashish Toshniwal who called on Congress to regulate Facebook. According to Levie, \"There are so many examples where we don't have modern ways of either regulating, controlling, or putting the right protections in place in the internet age. And this is a fundamental issue that, that we're gonna have to grapple with as an industry for the next decade.\"\n\nOn April 18, 2018, Facebook updated its privacy policy.\n\nOn May 2, 2018, SCL Group, which owns Cambridge Analytica, was dissolved. In a press release, the company indicated that \"the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company's customers and suppliers.\"\n\nOn May 15, 2018, The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica is being investigated by the FBI and the Justice Department. A source indicated to CBS News that prosecutors are focusing on potential financial crimes.\n\nOn May 16, 2018, Christopher Wylie testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Among other things, Wylie notes that Cambridge Analytica, under the direction of Steve Bannon, sought to \"exploit certain vulnerabilities in certain segments to send them information that will remove them from the public forum, and feed them conspiracies and they'll never see mainstream media.\" Wylie noted that the company targeted people with \"characteristics that would lead them to vote for the Democratic party, particularly African American voters.\"\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWhat are the key companies involved in the Facebook data privacy scandal?\n\nIn addition to Facebook, these are the companies connected to this data privacy story.\n\nSCL Group (formerly Strategic Communication Laboratories) is at the center of the privacy scandal, though has operated primarily through subsidiaries. Nominally, SCL was a behavioral research/strategic communication company based in the UK. The company was dissolved on May 1, 2018.\n\nCambridge Analytica and SCL USA are offshoots of SCL Group, primarily operating in the US. Registration documentation indicates the pair formally came into existence in 2013. As with SCL Group, the pair were dissolved on May 1, 2018.\n\nGlobal Science Research was a market research firm based in the UK from 2014 to 2017. It was the originator of the thisisyourdigitiallife app. The personal data derived from the app (if not the app itself) was sold to Cambridge Analytica for use in campaign messaging.\n\nEmerdata is the functional successor to SCL and Cambridge Analytica. It was founded in August 2017, with registration documents listing several people associated with SCL and Cambridge Analytica, as well as the same address as that of SCL Group's London headquarters.\n\nAggregateIQ is a Canadian consulting and technology company founded in 2013. The company produced Ripon, the software platform for Cambridge Analytica's political campaign work, which leaked publicly after being discovered in an unprotected GitLab bucket.\n\nCubeyou is a US-based data analytics firm that also operated surveys on Facebook, and worked with Cambridge University from 2013 to 2015. It was suspended from Facebook in April 2018 following a CNBC report.\n\nThe Internet Research Agency is a St. Petersburg-based organization with ties to Russian intelligence services. The organization engages in politically-charged manipulation across English-language social media, including Facebook.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWho are the key people involved in the Facebook data privacy scandal?\n\nNigel Oakes is the founder of SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. A report from Buzzfeed News unearthed a quote from 1992 in which Oakes stated, \"We use the same techniques as Aristotle and Hitler. ... We appeal to people on an emotional level to get them to agree on a functional level.\"\n\nAlexander Nix was the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, and a director of SCL Group. He was suspended following reports detailing a video in which Nix claimed the company \"offered bribes to smear opponents as corrupt,\" and that it \"campaigned secretly in elections... through front companies or using subcontractors.\"\n\nRobert Mercer is a conservative activist, computer scientist, and a co-founder of Cambridge Analytica. A New York Times report indicates that Mercer invested $15 million in the company. His daughters Jennifer Mercer and Rebekah Anne Mercer serve as directors of Emerdata.\n\nChristopher Wylie is the former director of research at Cambridge Analytica. He provided information to The Guardian for its exposé of the Facebook data privacy scandal. He has since testified before committees in the US and UK about Cambridge Analytica's involvement in this scandal.\n\nSteve Bannon is a co-founder of Cambridge Analytica, as well as a founding member and former executive chairman of Breitbart News, an alt-right news outlet. Breitbart News has reportedly received funding from the Mercer family as far back as 2010. Bannon left Breitbart in January 2018. According to Christopher Wylie, Bannon is responsible for testing phrases such as \"drain the swamp\" at Cambridge Analytica, which were used extensively on Breitbart.\n\nAleksandr Kogan is a Senior Research Associate at Cambridge University and co-founder of Global Science Research, which created the data harvesting thisisyourdigitiallife app. He worked as a researcher and consultant for Facebook in 2013 and 2015. Kogan also received Russian government grants and is an associate professor at St. Petersburg State University, though he claims this is an honorary role.\n\nJoseph Chancellor is a co-founder of Global Science Research, which created the data harvesting thisisyourdigitiallife app. Around November 2015, he was hired by Facebook as a \"quantitative social psychologist.\"\n\nMichal Kosinski, David Stillwell, and Thore Graepel are the researchers who proposed and developed the model to \"psychometrically\" analyze users based on their Facebook likes. At the time this model was published, Kosinski and Stillwell were affiliated with Cambridge University, while Graepel was affiliated with the Cambridge-based Microsoft Research. (None have an association with Cambridge Analytica, according to Cambridge University.)\n\nMark Zuckerberg is the founder and CEO of Facebook. He founded the website in 2004 from his dorm room at Harvard.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nHow have Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg responded to the data privacy scandal?\n\nEach time Facebook finds itself embroiled in a privacy scandal, the general playbook seems to be the same: Mark Zuckerberg delivers an apology, with oft-recycled lines, such as \"this was a big mistake,\" or \"I know we can do better.\" Despite repeated controversies regarding Facebook's handling of personal data, it has continued to gain new users. This is by design—founding president Sean Parker indicated at an Axios conference in November 2017 that the first step of building Facebook features was \"How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible?\" Parker also likened the design of Facebook to \"exploiting a vulnerability in human psychology.\"\n\nOn March 16, 2018, Facebook announced that SCL and Cambridge Analytica had been banned from the platform. The announcement indicated, correctly, that \"Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time,\" and passing the information to a third party was against the platform policies.\n\nThe following day, the announcement was amended to state:\n\nThe claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\n\nOn March 21, 2018, Mark Zuckerberg posted his first public statement about the issue, stating in part that:\n\n\"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\n\nOn March 26, 2018, Facebook placed full-page ads stating: \"This was a breach of trust, and I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to ensure this doesn't happen again,\" in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Wall Street Journal, as well as The Observer, The Sunday Times, Mail on Sunday, Sunday Mirror, Sunday Express, and Sunday Telegraph in the UK.\n\nIn a blog post on April 4, 2018, Facebook announced a series of changes to data handling practices and API access capabilities. Foremost among these include limiting the Events API, which is no longer able to access the guest list or wall posts. Additionally, Facebook removed the ability to search for users by phone number or email address, and made changes to the account recovery process to fight scraping.\n\nOne April 10, 2018 and April 11, 2018, Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress. Details about his testimony are in the next section of this article.\n\nOn April 10, 2018, Facebook announced the launch of its data abuse bug bounty program. While Facebook has an existing security bug bounty program, this is targeted specifically to prevent malicious users from engaging in data harvesting. There is no limit to how much Facebook could potentially pay in a bounty, though to date the highest amount the company has paid is $40,000 for a security bug.\n\nOn May 14, 2018, \"around 200\" apps were banned from Facebook as part of an investigation into if companies have abused APIs to harvest personal information. The company declined to provide a list of offending apps.\n\nOn May 22, 2018, Mark Zuckerberg testified, briefly, before the European Parliament about the data privacy scandal and Cambridge Analytica. The format of the testimony has been the subject of derision, as all of the questions were posed to Zuckerberg before he answered. Guy Verhofstadt, an EU Parliament member representing Belgium, said, \"I asked you six 'yes' and 'no' questions, and I got not a single answer.\"\n\nWhat did Mark Zuckerberg say in his testimony to Congress?\n\nIn his Senate testimony on April 10, 2018, Zuckerberg reiterated his apology, stating that \"We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake. And it was my mistake. And I'm sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here,\" adding in a response to Sen. John Thune that \"we try not to make the same mistake multiple times.. in general, a lot of the mistakes are around how people connect to each other, just because of the nature of the service.\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar asked if Facebook had determined whether Cambridge Analytica and the Internet Research Agency were targeting the same users. Zuckerberg replied, \"We're investigating that now. We believe that it is entirely possible that there will be a connection there.\" According to NBC News, this was the first suggestion there is a link between the activities of Cambridge Analytica and the Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWhat is the 2016 US presidential election connection to the Facebook data privacy scandal?\n\nIn December 2015, The Guardian broke the story of Cambridge Analytica being contracted by Ted Cruz's campaign for the Republican Presidential Primary. Despite Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix's claim in an interview with TechRepublic that the company is \"fundamentally politically agnostic and an apolitical organization,\" the primary financier of the Cruz campaign is Cambridge Analytica co-founder Robert Mercer—he donated $11 million to a pro-Cruz Super PAC. Following Cruz's withdrawal from the campaign in May 2016, the Mercer family began supporting Donald Trump.\n\nIn January 2016, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg told investors that the election was \"a big deal in terms of ad spend,\" and that \"Using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those.\"\n\nIn October 2017, Facebook announced changes to its advertising platform, requiring identity and location verification and prior authorization in order to run electoral advertising. In the wake of the fallout from the data privacy scandal, further restrictions were added in April 2018, making \"issue ads\" regarding topics of current interest similarly restricted.\n\nIn secretly recorded conversations by an undercover team from Channel 4 News, Cambridge Analytica's Nix claimed the firm was behind the \"defeat crooked Hillary\" advertising campaign, adding, \"We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape,\" and that \"this stuff infiltrates the online community, but with no branding, so it's unattributable, untrackable.\" The same exposé quotes Chief Data Officer Alex Tayler as saying, \"When you think about the fact that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by 3 million votes but won the electoral college vote, that's down to the data and the research.\"\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWhat is the Brexit tie-in to the Facebook data privacy scandal?\n\nAggregateIQ was retained by Nigel Farage's Vote Leave organization in the Brexit campaign, and both The Guardian and BBC claim that the Canadian company is connected to Cambridge Analytica and its parent organization SCL Group. UpGuard, the organization that found a public GitLab instance with code from AggregateIQ, has extensively detailed its connection to Cambridge Analytica and its involvement in Brexit campaigning.\n\nAdditionally, The Guardian quotes Wylie as saying the company \"was set up as a Canadian entity for people who wanted to work on SCL projects who didn't want to move to London.\"\n\nAdditional resources\n\nHow is Facebook affected by the GDPR?\n\nLike any organization providing services to users in European Union countries, Facebook is bound by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Due to the scrutiny Facebook is already facing regarding the Cambridge Analytica scandal, as well as the general nature of the social media giant's product being personal information, its strategy for GDPR compliance is similarly receiving a great deal of focus from users and other companies looking for a model of compliance.\n\nWhile in theory the GDPR is only applicable to people residing in the EU, Facebook will require users to review their data privacy settings. According to a ZDNet article, Facebook users will be asked if they want to see advertising based on partner information—in practice, websites that feature Facebook's \"Like\" buttons. Users globally will be asked if they wish to continue sharing political, religious, and relationship information, while users in Europe and Canada will be given the option of switching automatic facial recognition on again.\n\nFacebook members outside the US and Canada have heretofore been governed by the company's terms of service in Ireland. This has reportedly been changed prior to the start of GDPR enforcement, as this would seemingly make Facebook liable for damages for users internationally, due to Ireland's status as an EU member.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWhat are Facebook \"shadow profiles?\"\n\n\"Shadow profiles\" are stores of information that Facebook has obtained about other people—who are not necessarily Facebook users. The existence of \"shadow profiles\" was discovered as a result of a bug in 2013. When a user downloaded their Facebook history, that user would obtain not just his or her address book, but also the email addresses and phone numbers of their friends that other people had stored in their address books.\n\nFacebook described the issue in an email to the affected users. This is an excerpt of the email, according to security site Packet Storm:\n\nWhen people upload their contact lists or address books to Facebook, we try to match that data with the contact information of other people on Facebook in order to generate friend recommendations. Because of the bug, the email addresses and phone numbers used to make friend recommendations and reduce the number of invitations we send were inadvertently stored in their account on Facebook, along with their uploaded contacts. As a result, if a person went to download an archive of their Facebook account through our Download Your Information (DYI) tool, which included their uploaded contacts, they may have been provided with additional email addresses or telephone numbers.\n\nBecause of the way that Facebook synthesizes data in order to attribute collected data to existing profiles, data of people who do not have Facebook accounts congeals into dossiers, which are popularly called a \"shadow profile.\" It is unclear what other sources of input are added to said \"shadow profiles,\" a term that Facebook does not use, according to Zuckerberg in his Senate testimony.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nWhat are the possible implications for enterprises and business users?\n\nBusiness users and business accounts should be aware that they are as vulnerable as consumers to data exposure. Because Facebook harvests and shares metadata—including SMS and voice call records—between the company's mobile applications, business users should be aware that their risk profile is the same as a consumer's. The stakes for businesses and employees could be higher, given that incidental or accidental data exposure could expose the company to liability, IP theft, extortion attempts, and cybercriminals.\n\nThough deleting or deactivating Facebook applications won't prevent the company from creating so-called advertising \"shadow profiles,\" it will prevent the company from capturing geolocation and other sensitive data. For actional best practices, contact your company's legal counsel.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nHow can I change my Facebook privacy settings?\n\nAccording to Facebook, in 2014 the company removed the ability for apps that friends use to collect information about an individual user. If you wish to disable third-party use of Facebook altogether—including Login With Facebook and apps that rely on Facebook profiles such as Tinder—this can be done in the Settings menu under Apps And Websites. The Apps, Websites And Games field has an Edit button—click that, and then click Turn Off.\n\nFacebook has been proactively notifying users who had their data collected by Cambridge Analytica, though users can manually check to see if their data was shared by going to this Facebook Help page.\n\nFacebook is also developing a Clear History button, which the company indicates is \"their database record of you.\" TechRepublic's Dan Patterson noted on CBSN that \"there aren't a lot of specifics on what that clearing of the database will do, and of course, as soon as you log back in and start creating data again, you set a new cookie and you start the process again.\"\n\nTo gain a better understanding of how Facebook handles user data, including what options can and cannot be modified by end users, it may be helpful to review Facebook's Terms of Service, as well as its Data Policy and Cookies Policy.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nFor the latest IT security news and how-to tips, subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter.

    "article_text": "Fallout From Cambridge Analytic Data Usage\n\nThe conversation surrounding digital security is in the international spotlight following Cambridge Analytica filing for bankruptcy. Data and security experts have begun looking towards blockchain technology as a possible solution in providing additional security for consumers, medical patients, and those who perform professional work on the internet.\n\nIn December 2015, The Guardian was the first to uncover the ethical concerns associated with Cambridge Analytica and their ties with Facebook, when Cambridge was working on Senator Ted Cruz’s Presidential campaign:\n\n“Documents seen by the Guardian have uncovered longstanding ethical and privacy issues about the way academics hoovered up personal data by accessing a vast set of US Facebook profiles, in order to build sophisticated models of users’ personalities without their knowledge.”\n\nThe report continues, “…Cruz has turned to Cambridge Analytica for its unparalleled offering of psychological data based on a treasure trove of Facebook “likes” allowing it to match individuals’ traits with existing voter datasets, such as who owned a gun.”\n\nCambridge Analytica claims they did not use data from Global Science Research (GSR), which gathered data for Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), the parent company of Cambridge Analytica. A portion of a March 29th press release reads:\n\nCambridge Analytica did not use Facebook data from research company GSR on the 2016 presidential election. We provided polling, data analytics and digital marketing to the campaign as part of a collaborative effort under Brad Parscale, alongside the RNC and other vendors.\n\nChristopher Wylie, who helped found Cambridge Analytica details a different story. Wylie was with the company before leaving in late 2014, “Rules don’t matter for them. For them, this is a war, and it’s all fair,” he told the New York Times. “They want to fight a culture war in America; Cambridge Analytica was supposed to be the arsenal of weapons to fight that culture war,” he continued.\n\nThe Intercept detailed how Facebook’s practices failed to protect user data from firms like Cambridge Analytica, who in change used the information to launch targeted political messaging to those who were likely to be swayed by their messaging. From their report:\n\n“Facebook appears not to have considered Global Science Research’s data collection to have been a serious ethical lapse. Joseph Chancellor, Kogan’s main collaborator on the SCL project and a former co-owner of Global Science Research, is now employed by Facebook Research. “The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook,” a Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept.”\n\nAdditional Data Firms Suspended\n\nFacebook suspended two data firms in early April following the international outcry over privacy concerns. Michelle Castillo broke the story regarding the CubeYou suspension, accusing the firm of using personality quizzes to help marketers find likely customers, “…Upon being notified of CubeYou’s alleged violations, Facebook said it would suspend all CubeYou’s apps until a further audit could be completed.”\n\nIn March, Christopher Wylie claimed he helped found AggregateIQ (AIQ) while he worked for Cambridge Analytica. At the time of the Brexit referendum, Wylie claimed AIQ was operating as, “an internal department of Cambridge Analytica. It didn’t have a website and no contact number. The only public contact number was SCL’s website.”\n\nAIQ maintains they do not have a link to Cambridge Analytica or SLC, yet Facebook suspended the company after an internal review:\n\n“In light of recent reports that AggregateIQ may be affiliated with SCL and may, as a result, have improperly received (Facebook) user data, we have added them to the list of entities we have suspended from our platform while we investigate.”\n\nWill Companies Now Put Data Privacy As A Priority?\n\nDespite the public outcry for enhanced data privacy, various platforms have done little to change the manner in which they collect data. Twitter and other social media platforms have released updated terms of service to be more transparent about their practices. However, those do little to address the overall concern.\n\nSocial media platforms have yet to adopt an “Opt-In” instead of an “Opt-Out” strategy, which would allow users who don’t mind their data being shared to opt into the program. Currently, platforms hide their “opt-out” options deep within user settings, which require a measure of technical savvy to find.\n\nA switch to blockchain technology would help secure privacy on social media and on the internet as a whole. RecordsKeeper has the goal of allowing users to create verifiable and immutable records of any type of data with encryption used to provide added security measures.\n\nThis type of technology would eliminate the need for third-party verification sources. Such technology is years away from being implemented into a social media platform; however, if integrated users would be aware of the movement of their data, enhancing safety and security online.\n\nBlockchain innovation in combination with transparent business practices would allow users to feel safe when using social media and eliminate the unethical data market.",

The problems centre around data provided by users of a personality quiz app, thisisyourdigitallife, created by Global Science Research and downloaded by around 270,000 people. Where users' privacy settings allowed, the app was reportedly able to gather data about their Facebook contacts, gleaning information on a total of tens of millions of individuals which was then available to Cambridge Analytica for political message targeting.\n\n\n\nAs a result of the publicity surrounding Facebook's relationship with Cambridge Analytica, Facebook has undergone an app audit and decided to suspend around 200 apps, pending what it calls a 'thorough investigation' into whether or not their developers misused Facebook user data. Facebook previously gave third-party apps access to the personal data of those who used the apps, but shut down this practice in 2014.\n\n\n\nIme Archibong (pictured), Facebook's Head of Product Partnerships, comments: 'We have large teams of internal and external experts working hard to investigate these apps as quickly as possible.

    "article_text": "During his appearance before the United States Senate’s Commerce and Judiciary committees, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg did quite the job tiptoeing through a minefield of potentially threatening inquiries. Based on his answers, he either has no idea how the platform – which was founded controversially – works, or he blatantly lied to protect his interests in the firm.\n\nDespite the obviously high-tech nature of Facebook, no experts were present to evaluate the claims of the technology mogul. When asked by congressional leaders if Facebook sells user information to advertisers, Zuckerberg clearly stated that this was not the case. However, prompts located deep within one of the platform’s advanced features tell a very different story. Users who opt to download their data archive for advertisements are greeted by a notice that clearly lists which advertisers have collected their information.\n\nThe Inside Scoop on Facebook Data Sharing\n\nAt the center of the Zuckerberg controversy is the inappropriate use of market intelligence. Market research is an important resource that enterprises collect, evaluate and interpret to make sound business decisions. Without this kind of insight, companies would waste untold amounts of money by going forward with unprofitable initiatives, an expense that would eventually pass on to consumers.\n\nHowever, a problem exists when enterprises gather information improperly, such as when Cambridge Analytica – a third party vendor acting on behalf of Facebook – launched an online quiz via the social media platform to gather market intelligence. Former Cambridge Analytica business director Brittany Kaiser has stated that the poll count likely exceeds the 87 million users reported as harmed by the recent data violation. After news of the inappropriate use of this information, Facebook officials issued an updated data policy and notified its affected users that a company called Global Science Research may have inappropriately obtained their personal information.\n\nIn other news, Facebook is again feeling the heat for inappropriate use of its facial recognition technology. An Illinois judge has held Facebook liable for a pending class action suit alleging that the platform applies the technology without user permission. Facebook users are most familiar with this innovation through the site’s “Tag Suggestions” feature. The group filed the suit in 2015, claiming that the feature is a violation of Illinois privacy legislation.\n\nDuring the Senate hearings, Zuckerberg stated that, for security reasons, Facebook collects the data of netizens that do not use the social media platform. In response, the company published a blog post explaining that Facebook continues to collect information about users after they’ve logged out of the site through social media plugins such as share and like buttons, apps that use the Facebook login, Facebook analytics and sites and apps that run advertisements on Facebook. Through these devices, Facebook continues to receive users’ data, even when they’re not logged onto the site. When given the opportunity to explain this, Zuckerberg skated the issue with the Senate committee.\n\nEthics in the Digital Domain\n\nZuckerberg & Facebook opening up about the continual collection of user information has users and experts within the digital domain wondering just how far tech giants can go without crossing ethical boundaries.\n\nGiven that technology and social media are relatively young, there has yet to be put in place any solid boundaries regarding data acquisition from users within the digital realm. As of late, experts and scholars of personal information management have been utilizing the American Library Association (ALA) and the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), which have developed a code of ethics that applies across any number of fields and industries. The organizations are two of the most respected entities among professionals practicing in the library sciences discipline. The groups designed the framework to improve self-awareness and operational efficiency while avoiding ethical faux pas.\n\nThe code is the ideal framework for the Zuckerberg scenario, as it could prevent unfair censorship – a persistent issue among Facebook groups. More pointedly, the ethics code serves as a guideline for ensuring transparency and the protection of individual freedoms such as privacy.\n\nBut Wait, There’s More…\n\nA software engineer has revealed that a completely different exploit – one that’s been used by cyberattackers to acquire information about nearly all 2 billion Facebook users – remains fully intact. In fact, reveals programmer Pawan Deshpande, all social media platforms have co-opted the code in some form since its inception. What’s more, taking advantage of the vulnerability is remarkably easy, and the latest iteration of the code can probe thousands of users simultaneously. The technology, used by advertisers to deliver highly targeted messages, makes it easy to identify users.\n\nThis is the exact type of cyber exploit used by Russian hackers to send targeted political messages to voters during the last United States election. If this trend continues, Facebook and all other social media firms will, as with several industries before it, lose the privilege of self-directed governance, especially if corporate apologies don’t turn into expedited corrections.\n\nLike this article?

RSA Conference is only just over, and with Infosecurity Europe being only a month away, it’s a good time to think about the year (OK, this time it is 11 months) that has passed since the last Infosec and wonder if we have made any real, discernable progress.\n\nI would propose that the answer is a firm no and that the situation is exacerbated by growing data breach fatigue. For example, the U.K. alone was hit by 796 cyber attacks in 457 days.\n\nIt is a classic double whammy: The fact that we are not getting better means that there is more breach news, and the volume of breach news is creating fatigue that makes us numb to the growing problem.\n\nIn only a matter of weeks\n\nThe past several weeks have proven to be an interesting lab practical for my thesis. There was an announcement that over 5 million credit cards were stolen from the Hudson’s Bay Company, the company that operates Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor.\n\nNext came the announcement that Delta, Best Buy, and Sears were all part of a breach that compromised customer payment information. Panera Bread also announced a breach of the company’s website that some say placed the data of 37 million customers at risk.\n\nTwo weeks ago, it was announced that the accounts of more than 150 million users of the tracking application MyFitnessPal were accessed by hackers.\n\nThe biggest splash was reserved for Facebook and the 87 million people affected by the Cambridge Analytica and Global Science Research imbroglio. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg will be hauled in front of indignant members of Congress to answer for this breach, and you can bet that several bills will be proposed by those looking for headlines. But this too shall likely pass.\n\nThe response of just these two weeks of activity has been underwhelming. There has been no great outcry against this violation of privacy or the inconvenience to the affected consumers.\n\nWe’re even desensitised when it comes to our finances\n\nI believe the breaches of consumer credit card data are so frequent that they numb the general populace to the threat. We have all become adept at making the proper allowances when our credit cards are compromised and we get sent new ones. I have had to execute the drill of changing my credit card number on multiple sites several times in the past year. The first time is a shock, the second a nuisance, and the third is just one more ritual to be performed.\n\nThe companies affected seem equally desensitised, because history has shown they are not necessarily affected. They are certainly embarrassed when the news breaks, but these companies know, based on past transgressions, that they’ll suffer no permanent damage from these breaches, whether through company valuation or consumer activity. Dealing with several months of bad publicity seems to have become a cost of doing business, and companies know that as time passes, so will the reputational impact.\n\nWe may also be seeing a trend where businesses are attacked via third-party services that these businesses employ for certain activities such as credit card processing. The breach of Sears, Best Buy, and Delta, for example, was not a direct attack but an attack of a third-party firm shared by the three companies.\n\nAs businesses decide that securing credit card data is not a high priority and therefore offload the activity to third parties, it follows that the bad guys will soon recognise that breaching one of these services can get them access to the credit card data from multiple companies.\n\nA growing rift between development and security\n\nAnother problem is the continuing disconnect between development and security. Development still views security as anathema to building code on schedule. That is because security has not yet fully woven security tools into the fabric of the development environment.\n\nThis is unfortunate, as there are tools that can help developers create secure software and actually improve developer productivity. Until the two sides get better at working together, the divide will persist, and web-facing applications will be vulnerable to attack.\n\nAll these issues feed the problem: More vulnerabilities create more attacks; more attacks breed additional fatigue. So how can we wake up and fix the problems creating such a widespread headache?\n\nWill GDPR be an effective part of the solution?\n\nThe European Union is ramping up to enforce the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will take effect May 25, 2018. This data protection regulation applies to the processing of personal data of people in the EU by businesses that operate in the EU.\n\nIt’s worth mentioning that GDPR applies not only to firms based in the EU but to any organisation providing a product or service to residents of the EU.\n\nOnly time will tell how effective this regulation will be when it comes to enforcing firms to secure data. I have a feeling we’ll have PCI déjà vu, in that regulation enforcement doesn’t necessarily equate to security. I’m curious how long it will take for attackers to outsmart GDPR and continue finding creative new ways to hack sensitive information.\n\nAt the same time, I hope I’m wrong. I hope that GDPR will evolve to outsmart attackers and that other governments around the globe will implement equally aggressive regulations to minimize threats.\n\nWhat will we see at Infosecurity Europe?\n\nI anticipate that Infosec visitors will still see a disproportionate emphasis on the perimeter even though statistics say that the majority of exploited vulnerabilities are found in the software.\n\nBuilding walls and hanging concertina wire is always an instinctive response to threats, so the budgets have not yet shifted from the perimeter to the real attack surface—the web-facing application.\n\nWhat breach must occur to shake us all out of our fatigue? Will we see regulation in the near future that has a positive and productive effect? These are interesting premises to ponder as you walk the exhibit floors of Infosec.\n\nJim Ivers, VP of Marketing for the Software Integrity Group at Synopsys\n\nImage Credit: Ai825 / Shutterstock",

    "article_text": "\" \" Facebook users expressed outrage when learning their private data was used by Cambridge Analytica, the recently defunct British firm at the center of a major scandal involving the 2016 election, Donald Trump and private data. DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen news broke in early March 2018 that Cambridge Analytica, a data mining firm, accessed private information of more than 87 million Facebook users without their permission, people were outraged. But as the story grew, it became apparent that the information may have been used in nefarious ways, and that's when lawmakers on two continents demanded answers.\n\nIt's become even more clear, through investigative reporting and whistle blowers like Christopher Wylie, Cambridge Analytica improperly collected private data via Facebook and used it to help influence the 2016 election in favor of its client, Donald Trump. How could this happen? That's what the Stuff They Don't Want You To Know hosts Ben Bowlin, Noel Brown and Matt Frederick detail in the podcast, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, and what it means for all of us.\n\nFirst, it's important to start here: Cambridge Analytica specialized in collecting data on internet users and then created \"psychographic\" profiles to help influence their purchasing and voting decisions. However, the firm itself didn't actually mine the Facebook data. The firm only analyzed it to create the consumer profiles. The Facebook data in question was accessed by an app called ThisIsYourDigitalLife. It was created by a guy named Aleksandr Kogan, who worked at the department of psychology at Cambridge University and had a relationship with Cambridge Analytica via his company, Global Science Research.\n\nThisIsYourDigitalLife was a personality test, and in order to take it, users had to agree to allow the app access to their data. But unbeknownst to those users, it also gave Kogan access to their friends' data, as well. So even though only about 270,000 people downloaded the app, Kogan gained access to 87 million profiles' worth of information.\n\nWhen Facebook became aware of the issue, it told Cambridge Analytica that the firm violated Facebook's policies about sharing data. Facebook demanded a formal certification that the firm deleted any wrongly-acquired user information, which Cambridge Analytica provided, though clearly seems not to have followed through on. More trouble awaited when Cambridge Analytica's then-CEO Alexander Nix was caught on camera boasting that the firm engaged in shady political tactics like blackmail, entrapment and bribery to help its clients win elections.\n\nIn the fallout, Cambridge Analytica declared bankruptcy on May 2, 2018 and announced that it is closing its offices in both the U.S. and U.K. Some think the company may rebrand and continue similar consumer research endeavors under new names.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also had to deal with the aftermath. He testified before Congress in April, and Facebook took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers to apologize for the company's role in the data leak. It's not apparent, still, that anything illegal occurred, though it certainly has caused legislators in the United States and the United Kingdom to take a closer look at internet privacy and usage protections. The scandal also caused many Facebook users to examine how much they're sharing about their personal lives, who can see that information and how it can be used.\n\nSo now that Cambridge Analytica is shutting its doors, what's next? Has Facebook taken enough steps to address these problems on its platform? What does this mean for the future of our online lives? And just how much data are we unknowingly giving away every time we go online? Matt, Ben and Noel address all of these questions and more, but you have to listen to the to the entire podcast to hear their thoughts on how this could play out.",

    "article_text": "I'm going to assume that you weren't living in an internet-proof cave this weekend, and caught at least some of the stories about Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. The news first kicked off with the announcement of a data protection lawsuit filed against Cambridge Analytica in the UK on Friday evening (we'll likely have more on that lawsuit soon), followed quickly by an attempt by Facebook to get out ahead of the coming tidal wave by announcing that it was suspending Cambridge Analytica and some associated parties from its platforms, claiming terms of service violations. This was quickly followed on Saturday with two explosive stories. The first, from Carole Cadwalladr at The Guardian, revealing a \"whistleblower\" from the very early days of Cambridge Analytica (who more or less set up how it works with data profiles) named Christopher Wylie. This was quickly followed up by another story at the NY Times, which was a bit more newsy, providing more details on how Cambridge Analytica got data on about 50 million people out of Facebook.\n\nAdmittedly -- much of this isn't actually new. The Intercept had reported something similar a year ago, though it only said it was 30 million Facebook users, rather than 50 million. And that story built on the work of a 2015 (yes, 2015) story in the Guardian discussing how Cambridge Analytica was using data from \"tens of millions\" of Facebook users \"harvested without permission\" in support of Ted Cruz's presidential campaign.\n\nThere's a lot of heat on this story right now, and a lot of accusations being thrown around, and I'll admit that I'm not entirely sure where I come down on the details yet. I assume people on basically both sides of this issue will scream at me and call me names over this, but there's too much going on to fully understand what happened here. I will note that, in that Guardian story in 2015, Cruz told the publication that this data collecting and targeting effort was \"very much the Obama model.\" And political consultant Patrick Ruffini has a well worth reading Twitter thread arguing that people are overreacting to much of this, and that the 2012 Obama campaign did the exact same thing, and was celebrated for its creative use of data and targeting on the internet. Ad tech guy Jay Pinho makes the same point as well. Here's a Time article from 2012 excitedly talking up how the Obama campaign used Facebook in the same way:\n\nThat’s because the more than 1 million Obama backers who signed up for the app gave the campaign permission to look at their Facebook friend lists. In an instant, the campaign had a way to see the hidden young voters. Roughly 85% of those without a listed phone number could be found in the uploaded friend lists.\n\nOf course, there is one major difference between the Obama one and the Cambridge Analytica one, which involves the level of transparency. With the Obama campaign, people knew they were giving their data (and friend's data) to the cause of re-electing Obama. Cambridge Analytica got its data by having a Cambridge academic (who the new Guardian story revealed for the first time is also appointed to a position at St. Petersburg University) set up an app that was used to collect much of this data, and misled Facebook by telling them it was purely for academic purposes, when the reality is that it was setup and directly paid for by Cambridge Analytica with the intent of sucking up that data for Cambridge Analytica's database. Is that enough to damn the whole thing? Perhaps.\n\nAs for the claims that this is just the same old Facebook model of selling everyone's data... that was not true and still is not accurate. Facebook doesn't sell your data. It sells access to its users via the data it has on you. That may not seem different, but it is different. But the lines do seem to get a bit blurry, as it appears that Cambridge Analytica, via its partnership with the professor Dr. Aleksander Kogan (who apparently briefly changed his name to -- I kid you not -- Dr. Spectre) and his \"Global Science Research,\" basically paid people via Amazon's Mechanical Turk to do a \"personality assessment\" on Facebook that, as part of the process, exposed information about their entire social graph, which GSR apparently hoovered up and passed along to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nAt the very least, it can be said that Facebook should have recognized much earlier that this could and would be done, and to understand the potential privacy problems related to it. Facebook has a fairly long and painful history of not quite realizing how what it does impacts people's privacy, and this is one more example.\n\nBut, it's raising a bigger question, as well, and it's one that caused Facebook to do something that I'll definitively call as \"incredibly stupid,\" which is that it threatened to sue the Guardian over its story, mainly because the Guardian story refers to this whole mess as a \"data breach\" for Facebook's data.\n\nFacebook instructed external lawyers and warned us we were making 'false and defamatory' allegations. Today they said it was not correct to call this a data breach. We are calling it a data breach. https://t.co/Q8wrw0FDyr — Carole Cadwalladr (@carolecadwalla) March 17, 2018\n\nAnd, of course, Facebook wasn't the only one who threatened to sue. Cambridge Analytica did too:\n\nThe Observer also received the first of three letters from Cambridge Analytica threatening to sue Guardian News and Media for defamation.\n\nThere are issues of terminology here. Facebook, in its post, is adamant that what happened is not a \"breach\"\n\nThe claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\n\nThere are legal reasons why Facebook is so concerned about whether or not this is a \"breach\" and, let's face it, the company is about to face a million and a half lawsuits over this, not to mention government investigations (already Senator Amy Klobuchar has demanded Mark Zuckerberg's head on a platter testimony before the Senate and Massachusetts' Attorney General Maura Healey has announced the opening of an investigation, and there have also been rumblings out of the UK and the EU, as well as the FTC). But, there are also some fairly important legal obligations if this was a \"breach\" in the traditional sense, such as disclosing that to those impacted by the breach.\n\nI'm not entirely sure where I come down on the breach question. It doesn't feel like a traditional breach. It wasn't that Facebook coughed up this info, it was its users coughed up the info... and Facebook just made it easy for this outside \"academic\" to hoover up all that info by paying a bunch of people to take dopey personality quizzes. However, as the Guardian's Alex Hern points out, how do you distinguish what Kogan/GSR/Cambridge Analytica did from social engineering to get information.\n\nIf you're having trouble thinking of today's story as a \"breach\", try rephrasing it in your head as \"Facebook fell prey to a social engineering attack in which it was convinced to hand over user data by an attacker who told it what it wanted to hear\". — you heard it here first: tweting is bad (@alexhern) March 17, 2018\n\nOf course, there is something of a difference: it still wasn't Facebook per se coughing up the info. It was Facebook's own users. And, you might even argue that if you believe that Facebook doesn't \"own\" all this data in the first place, that it was actually those Facebook users coughing up a bunch of their own data -- including lots of data about their friends. Needless to say, this is a mess where a lot more transparency might help, and that transparency is going to be forced upon Facebook with a sledgehammer in the near near future.\n\nBut, regardless of where you come down on all of this, Facebook threatening defamation against the Guardian for calling this a data breach is ludicrous and Facebook should be ashamed and apologize. Even as it clearly disagrees with how the Guardian characterized much of the story, that's no excuse to whip out defamation threats. Not only is it incredibly stupid from a Facebook PR perspective (and makes the company look like a giant bully), it suggests that the company still has absolutely no fucking clue how to communicate with the press and the public about how its own platform works.\n\nIt's actually quite incredible to recognize just how big Facebook has gotten in the face of how little it seems to understand about what its own platform does.",

    "article_text": "Wie die Mutterfirma von Cambridge Analytica die Reformen in Saudiarabien beeinflusste Das saudische Königshaus hat seine jüngsten Reformen vor der Umsetzung testen lassen. Dafür engagierte es laut einem Medienbericht die SCL Group, zu der auch die umstrittene Beratungsfirma Cambridge Analytica gehört. Manuel Frick\n\nStatt im Vorfeld der Reformen die saudische Bevölkerung zu konsultieren, liess sich Kronprinz Mohammed bin Salman offenbar lieber von einer britischen Analysefirma beraten. (Bild: François Mori / AP)\n\nDer saudische Kronprinz Mohammed bin Salman gilt vielen als Befreier. Die Untertanen im Wüstenstaat dürfen neuerdings ins Kino und an Konzerte. Vor allem für die Frauen scheint sich etwas zu bewegen: Seit kurzem ist ihnen die Gründung eines Unternehmens ohne die Erlaubnis eines Mannes erlaubt; am 24. Juni soll das Fahrverbot für Frauen fallen.\n\nSCL analysierte die Bevölkerung\n\nDass es dem Kronprinzen bei den Reformen mitnichten um Mitbestimmung geht, zeigte vor kurzem die Festnahme zahlreicher Frauenrechtlerinnen und Frauenrechtler. Die Botschaft ist klar: Freiheiten werden nicht erkämpft, sondern gewährt. Im Vorfeld der Reformen fand denn auch keine offene Debatte in der saudischen Gesellschaft statt. Wie jüngste Enthüllungen der «New York Times» zeigen, holte sich Mohammed bin Salman stattdessen Unterstützung bei der britischen SCL Group, um die Befindlichkeiten in der Bevölkerung zu analysieren.\n\nDie britische Firma, die nach dem Facebook-Datenskandal ihrer Tochterfirma Cambridge Analytica (CA) ankündigte, ihren Betrieb einzustellen, hat indes mehr getan, als nur eine psychologische Studie zu erstellen. Die SCL Group soll gleich auch mehrere Reformvorschläge getestet haben, berichtet die Zeitung unter Berufung auf leitende SCL-Angestellte sowie westliche Berater, die im Königreich gearbeitet hatten. Einer der getesteten Vorschläge sei die Zulassung von Kinos gewesen, ein anderer die Aufhebung des Fahrverbots für Frauen.\n\nProjekt auf Linkedin-Profil erwähnt\n\nDie SCL Group erstellte die Studie im Geheimen und verpflichtete involvierte Mitarbeiter zu Verschwiegenheit. Trotzdem listet ein ehemaliger Mitarbeiter das Projekt auf seiner Linkedin-Seite auf. Er habe bei SCL «Fokusgruppen analysiert» und «Berichte geschrieben für ein Forschungsprojekt über ökonomische Reformen im Königreich Saudiarabien». Sein Engagement für SCL beschränkte sich laut seinem Profil auf wenige Monate und endete im Januar 2016.\n\nEine frühere CA-Projektleiterin beschrieb in ihrem Linkedin-Profil ihre Arbeit für das Herrscherhaus als «konzentriert auf die Entwicklung einer nationalen Reforminitiative für die Bemühungen des Landes, seine Wirtschaft von der Abhängigkeit von Öl wegzudiversifizieren». Mittlerweile ist die von der «New York Times» zitierte Beschreibung der Projektleiterin nicht mehr abrufbar.\n\nDie neuen Freiheiten sind also weniger Ausdruck einer demokratischen Öffnung, sondern eher als Reaktion auf den stark gesunkenen Ölpreis zu verstehen. Die staatlichen Einnahmen, mit denen sich das Herrscherhaus bisher die Zustimmung der Bevölkerung erkaufen konnte, haben sich in den vergangenen Jahren verringert. Um die Ausfälle beim Ölgeschäft zu kompensieren, muss die saudische Wirtschaft diversifizieren und braucht dazu neue Arbeitskräfte. Mit den Reformen für die Frauen schöpft das saudische Herrscherhaus das bisher weitgehend brachliegende Potenzial von 50 Prozent der Bevölkerung aus.\n\nEine Anleitung für die Herrscher\n\nUm die Abhängigkeit von den Öleinnahmen zu reduzieren, hat das saudische Königshaus 2016 eigens einen Entwicklungsplan entworfen. Unter den Beratungsfirmen, die an der Ausarbeitung des Plans unter dem Namen «Vision 2030» beteiligt waren, wurde offenbar der SCL-Bericht herumgereicht. Ein westlicher Berater, der Einsicht in das Dokument hatte, bezeichnet die Untersuchungsergebnisse als «machiavellistisch». Der Bericht lese sich wie eine Anleitung für das Königshaus, um die Stimmung im Volk zu beeinflussen, indem es in bestimmten Bereichen die Zügel lockere.\n\nDas saudische Königshaus ist indes bei weitem nicht die einzige Regierung, die auf Dienstleistungen der britischen Firma zurückgriff, um ihre Bevölkerung besser kontrollieren zu können. Das Angebot der SCL Group richtet sich gemäss ihrem Leitbild, das noch immer auf deren Website abrufbar ist, explizit an staatliche Kunden. Demnach sieht es SCL als ihren Auftrag, «sowohl für einheimische wie auch für internationale Regierungsstellen Verhaltensänderungen zu bewirken mittels Recherchen, Daten, Analysen und Strategien».\n\nKampagne gegen Katar\n\nIm vergangenen Jahr haben die Vereinigten Arabischen Emirate mithilfe von SCL eine Social-Media-Kampagne gegen Katar geführt, das zurzeit von den Emiraten, Saudiarabien und deren Alliierten blockiert wird. In Indonesien hat SCL 1998 nicht nur Tausende von Bürgern überwacht, sondern laut einem Unternehmensdokument auch grosse Demonstrationen an Universitäten organisiert, bei denen die Studenten «Dampf ablassen» sollten.\n\nDie SCL-Tochterfirma Cambridge Analytica, die stark in die Wahlkampagne des amerikanischen Präsidenten Donald Trump eingebunden war, ging bei ihren Aktivitäten ebenfalls nicht zimperlich vor. Der damalige CA-Chef Alexander Nix brüstete sich in einem heimlich vom TV-Sender Channel 4 aufgenommenen Video damit, besonders skrupellose Methoden anzuwenden. Seine Firma besteche auch Kandidaten der Gegenpartei und setze Prostituierte auf sie an, um sie anschliessend blosszustellen oder zu erpressen, sagte Nix.\n\nSCL-Gründer Nigel Oakes beschrieb seine Vorgehensweise schon vor über einem halben Jahrhundert entwaffnend ehrlich. «Wir nutzen dieselben Methoden wie Aristoteles und Hitler», sagte er 1992 gegenüber einem Branchenmagazin. «Wir sprechen die Menschen auf emotionaler Ebene an, um sie dazu zu bewegen, auf funktioneller Ebene zuzustimmen.»",

    "article_text": "BEN NORTON: It’s The Real News. I’m Ben Norton.\n\nAn explosive new investigative report by the journalist Max Blumenthal exposes how Cambridge Analytica’s parent company SCL Group ran a counterinsurgency program in Yemen on behalf of a U.S.-based military contractor. Cambridge Analytica was a political data company that dissolved this year after it was exposed that the firm had been hired by the Donald Trump campaign to manipulate the 2016 presidential election. Blumenthal obtained exclusive documents revealing that Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, which is called SCL Group, honed the deceptive tactics that it later used in the 2016 U.S. election first in Yemen, as part of a secret surveillance operation called Project Titania. Max published these leaked documents at his independent investigative journalism website The Grayzone Project, which you can find at GrayzoneProject.com.\n\nThe surveillance operation run by SCL involved infiltrating local groups and spying on the domestic population using deliberately deceptive tactics. The operatives were instructed to use a, quote, “cover story,” unquote, to gather information. The foreign operatives in Yemen were also told to communicate with the British Embassy and register with the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which suggests that the UK government contracted SCL for the surveillance work. The documents furthermore show how SCL exploited local NGOs inside Yemen as part of its surveillant operation. An anonymous source also explained to Max how SCL tried to recruit them to pose as a journalist to infiltrate Iran, another country in the Middle East, in order to spy on the country and collect data. SCL Group specialize in what it openly called, quote, “psychological warfare,” end quote, influence operations, and did contract work with the UK government.\n\nJoining us to discuss this is Max Blumenthal. Max is an award-winning investigative journalist and the author of several books. He is also the editor of the independent news website The Grayzone Project. Max published his new report in two parts. You can find both at GrayzoneProject.com. With Max I also cohost the podcast Moderate Rebels, and I contribute to his website The Grayzone Project. Thanks for joining us, Max.\n\nMAX BLUMENTHAL: Thanks for having me on.\n\nBEN NORTON: So there’s a lot to unpack here. There are a lot of different names that viewers might not be familiar with. Some people might know of Cambridge Analytica because in the past several months there was a big media scandal over its role in infiltrating and influencing the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Before we get to discuss this Yemen operation, this counterinsurgency operation that you exposed, let’s just talk a bit about Cambridge Analytica and its parent company, the SCL Group. Can you explain to the audience what Cambridge Analytica and SCL are?\n\nMAX BLUMENTHAL: I would basically describe SCL as a private intelligence operation, or private intelligence agency. They call themselves a data firm, but I think that kind of undersells their ability to conduct not just surveillance, even kind of counterinsurgency operations, as I showed in Project Titania, but also influencing elections. And it’s something that they up until recently were pretty proud of doing. So proud that they boasted of, for example, cultivating anti-Russian sentiment among the Ukrainian population in the contested areas of eastern Ukraine on behalf of the Ukrainian government, and participating in the Ukrainian Color Revolution in 2004, which removed a Russian-oriented government and replaced it in basically, you know, in basically a Western-backed de facto coup with a Western-oriented government. SCL Group was front and center as part, in part of that, in that operation, and they bragged about it on their website. They’ve been active in Kenyan elections.\n\nAnd it was only a matter of time before they-. And you know, they’ve been active in elections around the world, as well as counterinsurgency-style operations, where they collect data on local populations in conflict areas. And they freely acknowledged, I mean, I wouldn’t say this investigation was necessarily explosive. I think it’s really valuable to have these documents. I don’t know if anyone has produced original documents like these that really lay out the plans for what SCL and its other private intelligence partners were doing in conflict zones like Yemen. But SCL has freely acknowledged its work in Syria and Libya and Iran on its website, as well. We just didn’t know what the nature of it was.\n\nSo what I was able to do is kind of fill in some of the blanks, dot some of the Is and the Ts that were already on the webs-. That were already on the website, and kind of really highlight the use of deception that SCL had perfected in order to insinuate itself into areas that were difficult for its Western clients to, its Western patrons to reach. SCL is the British parent company of Cambridge Analytica, which more Americans would be familiar with. Cambridge Analytica obtained the data through Facebook of 87 million Americans as part of an influence operation that it carried out partly on behalf of the Donald Trump campaign. It was also working with Ted Cruz, and it worked in several campaigns in 2014 in the U.S., and basically was owned by Stephen Bannon and the Mercer operation of reclusive billionaire Robert Mercer, who until recently was the patron of Stephen Bannon and one of the major backers of the whole kind of apparatus that made up the Trump 2016 campaign. Robert Mercer’s daughter Rebecca was a co-owner of Cambridge Analytica, and was involved with SCL Group, and Bannon was also co-owner.\n\nSo this scandal, naturally, was going to erupt in the Trump era, when Democrats in Congress are really angry about the fact that Donald Trump won it all and were looking into how he did it, and seeking to frame it as this kind of nefarious operation and to paint Trump as a figure without popular support. Well, first they look to Russia. And you know, as we’ve done in interview after interview here, shown that there really wasn’t a whole lot there to demonstrate collusion. So they finally turned to something we have been talking about for over a year, for a while, Cambridge Analytica. Cambridge Analytica was also involved in Brexit. The oligarchs who started the Brexit campaign hired Cambridge Analytica, and Bannon learned a lot of lessons there. So finally, the Democrats started looking at it. An insider from Cambridge Analytica emerged and detailed a lot of the deceptive practices they used. And then Channel 4 in the UK conducted a sting on Cambridge Analytica. One of their executives was boasting of honey traps, and all kinds of, you know, James Bond villain-style tactics that they pledge to use.\n\nAnd you know, I think what I’ve done with this investigation is show that a lot of the tactics it uses are just good old-fashioned counterinsurgency. I interviewed Yasha Levine, who’s the author of Surveillance Valley, which is a great book on how the Internet grew out of counterinsurgency programs and is used to surveil us. And Yasha said, yeah, this is, a lot of these tactics that are laid out in the documents for Project Titania in Yemen, they look like Vietnam-era counterinsurgency stuff. Nothing particularly significant, but it’s still, you know, pretty sinister. And so when you kind of put all of these different pieces together, and you consider the fact that one organization working with this web of other private intelligence groups is carrying out counterinsurgency, kind of surveillance-style operations, to collect data on people in conflict areas in the Middle East. As one of my sources told me, they’re also posing as journalists to go into areas like Iran, and posing as students, either foreign exchange students or Arabic language students, to collect data in Syria.\n\nThey’re doing that, and then they’re starting to hone their craft in the West, particularly in the UK and the U.S., through this cutout company, Cambridge Analytica. It really starts to look like a case of blowback, where the tactics that the West is applying against the populations it’s targeting in the third world are coming back to its own elections. And they’re being used to elect, in some cases, extreme right-wing candidates, and to carry out influence operations and covert propaganda against a public that believes that, you know, it’s acting democratically.\n\nBEN NORTON: Yeah, so you raise a lot of important points there. And one of the things I want to try to do is help unpack some of these details for viewers. There are a lot of different companies and names and people involved in this. We’ve been talking about SCL, which stands for Strategic Communication Laboratories. That’s the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, which you mentioned is, it was co-owned by Steve Bannon and Robert Mercer, who backed Donald Trump, also involved in Project Titania, which is this counterinsurgency operation in Yemen. Also involved is a U.S.-based military contractor Archimedes. This is the company that, that, that the SCL Goup was in fact operating on behalf of. And then finally, of course, you mention in your article, and it’s been documented elsewhere, that SCL frequently had contracts with the U.K. government. So we see a web of different operatives here, and we see multiple governments, including the UK and the U.S. involved in some ways. Maybe if not the U.S. government is directly involved, at least the UK government is involved. Can you speak a little bit more about the the kind of web of, or the revolving door, rather, between governments and private interests here, and how companies like SCL, as you mentioned Yasha Levine has documented how these these tech companies often serve as contractors for governments, and they advance those governments’ interests through soft power.\n\nMAX BLUMENTHAL: Basically, I obtained the documents that were given to, I suppose, I assume the employees of these two private intelligence firms, SCL, which is the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, and Archimedes. Archimedes appeared to be, SCL appeared to be contracted through Archimedes, and Archimedes was based, I think, in the Bay Area. It’s a U.S.-based company. And the mission, as laid out in these documents which I published in full at GrayzoneProject.com, were instructions for entering Yemen in 2009, which was really the height of the Obama drone assassination program, into the two provinces where the skies were shadowed by U.S. drones and the ground was substantially occupied, or, or featured massive mobilization and organization by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. And what SCL seek to do was to gather data on young males, and what attracted them to jihadist activity and then they were going to develop a, what they called, I think, I think they openly said counterpropaganda campaign. But an influencing operation to turn the young males somehow against jihadist recruitment.\n\nAnd this meant that they had to first find local researchers, Yemenis to conduct research on the young males, basically getting them into schools and different community centers to answer questionnaires which SCL and Archimedes had drawn up. And they were specifically ordered, the SCL operatives were specifically ordered to develop a cover story with the local Yemeni researchers, and various cover stories were proposed so that the researchers on the ground, the Yemeni population, would not know that they were carrying out an actual counterinsurgency operation, possibly on behalf of the UK government. All of these operatives from SCL were told to gather at the British embassy in Sana’a, the Yemeni capital.\n\nSo it’s pretty clear that something that the, either the British government or whoever hired SCL was going on, that they sought to conceal-. And this has had really negative ramifications in the past when the element of concealment fell apart. For example, the polio eradication campaign in Pakistan, which was being carried out by the CIA in order to extract the DNA of Osama bin Laden’s family. When the rural population of Pakistan discovered that they, this wasn’t, in fact, a polio eradication program, and that the local Pakistanis were acting as a front for the CIA, jihadist groups declared a boycott, and polio began to spread massively spread all the way into Afghanistan. So you can, you know, you really have a kind of precedent for, for, you know, a critical, for a critical look at a program like this. I mean, there’s a precedent for programs like this doing deep damage to local populations, is what I’m saying.\n\nAnd so, you know, it all goes back to a web of private intelligence operatives. I’ve talked about SCL before, but there’s also Archimedes. I don’t know if this firm still exists, but I found one character in a communication I obtained who was sort of the contact between SCL and Archimedes. His name was Tim Reason. He’s now at another firm I never heard of before called Madison Springfield. Character, you know, there’s there’s very little on this character. I’ve seen him participate in some programs for AFRICOM, which is the U.S. military kind of archipelago of U.S. military bases in Africa. But I know very little about him. I did find him, however, in the HBGary leaks, which were published by WikiLeaks in 2011. And HBGary is another private intelligence firm. And basically, if you go into these leaks, I don’t know any normal people who have time to do this, but I kind of had to do it to produce this investigation, you’re just going to find a bunch of private spies talking to each other about designing competing mass surveillance programs at the dawn of the Arab Spring to spy on Arab youth, gobble up their personal information, and then design influence operations based on what they’ve learned about Arab youth, who are considered sort of a restive population engaged in this revolutionary process that’s overturning governments across the Arab world.\n\nSo Tim Reason turns up in all of these email threads with different characters from private intelligence firms I’d never heard of before, along with staffers from Apple, who are from the Homeland Security division of Apple. I didn’t know Apple had a Homeland Security division before, or that they were this involved, Google is also involved here, this involved in mass surveillance. And it really it’s just that kind of just scratching the surface. But it’s really a disturbing portrait of this private intelligence web which is carried out, carrying out influence operations, covert propaganda, and mass surveillance completely out of the sight of most of the world’s population by design. And they’re being contracted by governments to do so so the governments don’t have to take any responsibility. I learned about this all thanks to the work of Barrett Brown. And Barrett Brown went to prison for 56 months because he received all of these hacked e-mails from the Anonymous collective, and reported on them. For reporting on them. He went to prison under Obama. And it’s thanks to Barrett Brown, and to WikiLeaks, Julian Assange is now, you know, undergoing horrible conditions at the Ecuadorian embassy in London thanks to pressure from the U.S. and UK government. It’s really thanks to these two that we know about these programs, and that we know about the ROMAS/COIN mass surveillance program that I wrote about that Tim Reason was involved in.\n\nSo really just by starting this investigation, looking at these SCL documents, I learned about this entire wider web of covert influence operations. And we really have to see Cambridge Analytica as just the tip of the massive iceberg that might represent the greatest threat to whatever’s left of democracy.\n\nBEN NORTON: Well, we’ll have to end our conversation there. We were joined by Max Blumenthal. He is an award-winning journalist and the author of several books. He is also the editor of the website The Grayzone Project, which you can find at GrayzoneProject.com. He just published a two-part exposé on the SCL Group, which is the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, exposing how it led a counterinsurgency and surveillance operation in Yemen. Max also mentioned Yasha Levine, and we at The Real News have an interview with Aaron Maté in which Aaron Maté and Yasha Levine discuss Yasha’s new book Surveillance Vally, which is more about all of these issues we discussed today, big tech companies and their relations to governments. But thanks for joining us here at The Real News, Max.\n\nMAX BLUMENTHAL: Thanks for having me.\n\nBEN NORTON: Reporting for The Real News. I’m Ben Norton.",

    "article_text": "(Bild: Benoit Bourgeois, European Union 2018)\n\nEin US-Medienprofessor hat bei einer Anhörung im EU-Parlament zum Facebook-Datenskandal Mikrotargeting als \"massenhafte Menschenrechtsverletzung\" bezeichnet.\n\nDie zunehmende gezielte Werbeansprache von Nutzern mit auf sie zugeschnittenen Inhalten, die auf einer genauen Analyse der persönlichen Daten der Betroffenen beruht, kam bei einer Expertenbefragung im EU-Parlament zur Affäre rund um Facebook und Cambridge Analytica nicht gut weg. Die Demokratie müsse vor der dahinterstehenden Datenjagd geschützt werden, proklamierte David Carroll, Professor an der Parsons School of Design in New York, bei der zweieinhalbstündigen Anhörung. Das entsprechende Mikrotargeting entfalte inzwischen \"Makro-Effekte\", indem es zu \"massenhaften Menschenrechtsverletzungen\" führe.\n\n\"Psychologische Waffen\"\n\nMit dem umstrittenen Kampagneninstrument haben die Werbe- und die Social-Media-Industrie zusammen mit Militärausrüstern laut Carroll eine neue Form \"psychologischer Waffen\" geschaffen. Sie betrieben damit eine informationelle Kriegsführung, die etwa auf die gezielte Produktion von Falschnachrichten ausgerichtet sei. Dazu komme eine \"Datenwäsche\", da personenbezogene Nutzerinformationen widerrechtlich weitergereicht und teils mit weiteren Beständen vermischt würden, um die Ausgangssets \"zu reinigen\". Es handle sich dabei um schwere Datenverbrechen, die sich möglicherweise in Fällen wie der Trump-Wahlkampagne oder der möglichen Verstrickung im Brexit-Referendum auch gegen die Demokratie richteten.\n\nCambridge Analytica hatte 2016 behauptet, die Persönlichkeit aller 190 Millionen US-Wähler \"psychometrisch\" erfasst, einschlägige Profile erstellt und Donald Trump im Online-Wahlkampf damit maßgeblich unterstützt zu haben. Sollte es dem Big-Data-Haus wirklich gelungen sein, auf diese Weise auch nur kleine Wählergruppen beeinflusst zu haben, müssten diese schmutzigen Verfahren rasch beendet werden. Carroll habe daher Cambridge Analytica und den Mutterkonzern SCL Group verklagt, das offenbar auch über ihn angelegte Wählerdossier herauszugeben. Die Frist dafür sei gerade abgelaufen, ohne dass das britische Unternehmen dem nachgekommen sei. Damit drohe SCL nun auch ein Strafverfahren.\n\n\"Ethische Pause\"\n\nDie britische Datenschutzbeauftragte Elizabeth Denham, die den Skandal und andere Profiling-Maßnahmen im Rahmen politischer Kampagnen gerade auch im Auftrag ihrer EU-Kollegen untersucht, plädierte fürs Erste für eine \"ethische Pause\" bei der Ausspähung von Nutzerinteressen und folgender verhaltensbasierter Werbung. In dieser Zeit müssten Mikrotargeting-Prozesse genauer unter die Lupe genommen werden und die damit verknüpften zahlreichen \"Graubereiche\" ausgeleuchtet werden. Die dahinterstehende Technik sei offenbar weitgehend außer Kontrolle geraten und habe die Privatsphäre und Transparenzprinzipien hinter sich gelassen.\n\nEin Mitarbeiter Denhams erläuterte, dass an der aktuellen Untersuchung allein 40 Experten aus der Behörde sowie einige externe Sachverständige beteiligt seien. Bei Cambridge Analytica und anderen Akteuren im Bereich der sozialen Medien hätten die Kontrolleure \"Hunderte Terabyte an Daten\" beschlagnahmt. Einen ersten Bericht zu den bereits durchgeführten Analysen wolle die Aufsichtsbehörde noch im Juni veröffentlichen. Der Insider betonte, dass dabei \"alle Sanktionsmöglichkeiten\" auch nach der neuen Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) auf dem Tisch lägen.\n\nDie Bürger sollten erkennen, dass die Regulierer bei Missbrauch angemessen einschreiten, ergänzte Denham im Blick auf die breite Palette an Strafformen in dem Fall. \"Wir werden Empfehlungen abgegeben, die über Großbritannien hinausgehen\", kündigte sie an. Diese schlössen den Forschungsbereich ein, in dem der Datenabgriff bei Facebook seinen Ausgang nahm. Grundsätzlich verglich die Kontrolleurin Datenverbrechen mit \"echten Straftaten\", die die Behörden mit der DSGVO nun auch im Internet mit mehr Befugnissen und Ressourcen verfolgen könnten. Parallel sei es aber auch nötig, dass Millionen Nutzer von ihren gestärkten Rechten etwa auf Auskunft und gegebenenfalls Löschung oder Korrektur der über sie erhobenen Daten Gebrauch machten.\n\nMikrotargeting verbieten\n\nSandy Parakalis, der 2011 und 2012 als Betriebsmanager bei Facebook tätig war, empfahl den Gesetzgebern, bei politischen Anzeigen Mikrotargeting zu untersagen. Dies würde den Betreibern sozialer Netzwerke und anderen Online-Firmen sehr viel Arbeit bereiten, da sie derzeit in der Regel zwischen Politmarketing und klassischer Unternehmenswerbung gar nicht unterscheiden könnten. Wichtig sei es auch, Zugangsbestimmungen zu Nutzerdaten rigoros durchzusetzen. Sonst sollten Anreize geschaffen werden, um die Risiken rund um Big-Data-Analysen etwa über einen Rahmen für Cyberversicherungen zu senken. Sicherheitsgurts in Autos hätten sich ebenfalls zunächst getrieben von Versicherungsfirmen verbreitet.\n\nIn der Cambridge-Analytica-Affäre beklagte der Praktiker, dass Facebook es auch nach der internen Aufdeckung der britischen Firma über zwei Jahre lang nicht untersagt habe, weiter auf der Plattform zu werben. Inzwischen hätten die Kalifornier zwar mehr Kontrolloptionen für den Datenschutz der Nutzer geschaffen, die aber teils \"nicht so funktionieren, wie es dargestellt wird\". So hätten Gerätehersteller etwa über spezielle Partnerschaften jahrelang einen gesonderten Zugriff auf Informationen über die Mitglieder erhalten, auch wenn letztere einen solchen ausdrücklich nicht wollten. Dies verstoße auch gegen die Unternehmensangaben und regulatorische Auflagen.\n\nAufteilung Facebooks\n\nNach Ansicht des Ex-Mitarbeiters hat Facebook in gewissen Kommunikationsbereichen eine Monopolstellung inne. Er riet den Abgeordneten daher, einzelne Produktlinien wie das Kernnetzwerk, Messenger, WhatsApp oder Instagram in separate Firmen aufzuteilen oder in Untereinheiten, die untereinander keine Nutzerdaten austauschen dürften.\n\nDie Regulierer sollten zudem schon jetzt nachdenken über neue technische Entwicklungen wie \"Deep Fakes\", also komplett fabrizierte Videos oder Tonaufnahmen, oder Voraussagen zu Nutzerverhalten mithilfe von Künstlicher Intelligenz.\n\nCambridge Analytica am Brexit Schuld?\n\nSystematische Tricks und Wahlbetrug im großen Stil warf mit Christopher Wylie der Whistleblower seinem früheren Arbeitgeber Cambridge Analytica vor, der den Skandal mit ans Licht gebracht hatte. Das Unternehmen habe mit Wissen des Mutterhauses SCL psychologisch trainierte Algorithmen nicht nur in Wahlkämpfen eingesetzt, sondern auch, um allgemein Desinformation, Gerüchte, kompromittierende Details und Propaganda zu verbreiten. Beim Brexit-Referendum sei dies mit Wissen von Beratern britischer Ministerien erfolgt. Das Recht auf freie Wahl sei damit unterlaufen worden. Als Gegenmittel brachte Wylie unter anderem den Einbau von Transparenz direkt in die Technik ins Spiel nach dem Vorbild von \"Privacy by Design\".\n\nSCL habe zunächst für das britische Verteidigungsministerium gearbeitet und im Geheimen Propaganda betrieben, berichtete auch Carole Cadwalladr vom \"Guardian\". Im Brexit-Fall seien die dabei entwickelten Waffen dann \"gegen die eigene Bevölkerung gerichtet\" worden. Dabei hätten die Beteiligten über eine Reihe undurchsichtiger Technologiefirmen wie AggregateIQ in Kanada auch die gesetzlichen Bestimmungen für Spendengelder ausgehebelt. Facebook-Chef Mark Zuckerberg, der im Mai sein obligatorisches \"Sorry\" in einer Runde mit Volksvertretern zum Ausdruck gebracht hatte, wolle nun allenfalls den Eindruck vermitteln, bei den parlamentarischen Untersuchungen zu kooperieren.

But his nobler pretensions have been muted by his outsize spending habits, as well as a roundup of billionaires, princes and other officials tied to previous governments.

The consultant said the report used dozens of focus groups to examine levels of frustration and satisfaction, as well as the legitimacy of the royal family and the political structure, and showed there was widespread discontent.\n\nThe consultant’s account was consistent with that of a former employee at SCL.

    "article_text": "Ein US-Bürger verlangt vollständige Auskunft über die Daten, die Cambridge Analytica von ihm gesammelt hat. Da die zuständige britische Niederlassung dem Ersuchen nicht nachkam, will die Datenschutzbehörde ICO nun die Herausgabe erzwingen.\n\nDie britische Datenschutzbehörde ICO (Information Commissioner's Office) will von der umstrittenen Datenanalysefirma Cambridge Analytica die Herausgabe aller erhobenen Informationen über einen US-Bürger erzwingen. Zu diesem Zweck hat die Behörde einen Durchsetzungsbescheid an die britische Niederlassung des Konzerns, SCL Elections Ltd., zugestellt – dieses Unternehmen hat Daten von US-Bürgern in Großbritannien verarbeitet. Das teilt das ICO auf seiner Website mit.\n\nFür die Herausgabe aller gespeicherten Daten des US-Bürger David Carroll einschließlich einer Klärung, wie diese Daten erhoben wurden, hat das Unternehmen nun 30 Tage Zeit. Kommt es der Aufforderung nicht nach, könnte das ICO allein ein Bußgeld in Höhe von bis zu 500.000 Britische Pfund verhängen; die Behörde wolle den Fall dann zudem vor Gericht bringen, wo ein Bußgeld in unbestimmter Höhe verhängt werden könne. Das Auskunftsersuchen (Subject Access Request) beruht auf dem britischen Data Protection Act von 1998 und erstreckt sich auf alle im Vereinigten Königreich verarbeiteten Daten über Personen jeglicher Staatsangehörigkeit.\n\nDas Unternehmen Cambridge Analytica mit Hauptsitz in den USA hat auf Umwegen mehr als 80 Millionen Benutzerprofile von Facebook gesammelt und ausgewertet und damit einen der größten Skandale um Datenmissbrauch in den sozialen Medien ausgelöst. Außerdem hält sich das Unternehmen zugute, psychologische Profile aller 240 Millionen US-Wähler zu besitzen sowie im US-Präsidentschaftswahlkampf 2016 Donald Trump maßgeblich zum Sieg verholfen zu haben.\n\nDie britische Muttergesellschaft SCL Group und Cambridge Analytica haben Anfang Mai 2018 in Großbritannien Insolvenz angemeldet – der Firma seien die Kunden davongelaufen, und die Anwaltskosten im Zuge des Skandals seien immer weiter gewachsen. Im März dieses Jahres waren die Büros von Cambridge Analytica in Großbritannien auf richterliche Anordnung hin von Mitarbeitern des ICO durchsucht und Server beschlagnahmt worden.\n\nCarroll, ein Professor an der Parsons School of Design in New York, hatte zunächst im Januar 2017 ein Auskunftsersuchen an Cambridge Analytica geschickt und war von der SCL Group an das britische Tochterunternehmen verwiesen worden. Er steht dem vermehrten Sammeln von Daten kritisch gegenüber und sieht trotz des Facebook-Skandals weitere Missbrauchsfälle kommen.\n\nIm März 2017 erhielt er eine Aufstellung der für Cambridge Analytica erhobenen Daten über ihn, über die er nach Ansicht des Unternehmens Auskunft verlangen könne. Die Antwort fand Carroll jedoch unvollständig und beschwerte sich beim ICO, das sich seinerseits an die britische Niederlassung wandte und klarstellte, dass sich auch ein US-Bürger auf das britische Auskunftsrecht auf vollständige Offenlegung der Daten berufen könne.\n\nIm November 2017 schließlich brach SCL Elections in rüdem Ton jede weitere Korrespondenz in der Sache ab. In einer geharnischten Antwort stellt die Datenschutzbeauftragte Elisabeth Denham klar, dass jeder Bürger das Recht habe, die über ihn gespeicherten Daten sowie die Umstände und die rechtliche Grundlage ihrer Erhebung ausgehändigt zu bekommen. Unabhängig von der Insolvenz des Mutterkonzerns und Cambridge Analyticas werde die Behörde dieses Ersuchen durchsetzen und bei Zuwiderhandlung rechtliche Schritte einleiten. (tiw)\n\n",

    "article_text": "MPs call for investigation into concerns over SCL Group and its access to secret documents\n\nThe chair of the Commons home affairs committee has called for a full investigation into the activities of Cambridge Analytica after it emerged that its parent company was granted provisional “List X” status by the Ministry of Defence until 2013, granting it access to secret documents.\n\nThe Labour MP Yvette Cooper said there were serious concerns around SCL Group and its subsidiary Cambridge Analytica, which is being investigated by the information commissioner over a huge leak of Facebook data.\n\nSCL Group had a close working relationship with the MoD and was paid almost £200,000 for carrying out two separate projects. List X contractors are bound by strict rules over document security, and the MoD insists there was no recorded data breach.\n\n\n\nCooper said: “Given the mounting concerns about Cambridge Analytica’s disregard for proper standards, particularly on information and data protection, we ought to know what the government contracts were with Cambridge Analytica or SCL and what access to information they had.”\n\nIn 2014, MoD officials worked with SCL Group on “Project Duco” to analyse how people would interact with certain government messaging.\n\nThe work on Project Duco is likely to raise concerns that government officials were aware of Cambridge Analytica and SCL’s operations, and intended to use them to promote government messages.\n\n“There are now growing concerns about whether there should be a wider investigation into their activities,” Cooper said. “There are concerns about the implications for democracy, about information being used in an illegitimate way and no one has the chance to counteract it, and that raises real problems.”\n\nPlay Video 13:04 Cambridge Analytica whistleblower: 'We spent $1m harvesting millions of Facebook profiles' – video\n\nThe SCL project was carried out by the MoD’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), which is focused on maximising “the impact of science and technology for the defence and security of the UK”.\n\nAccording to a heavily redacted document released under freedom of information rules, Project Duco was part of the government’s “human and social influence” work, and SCL was paid £150,000. The company was also paid £40,000 for work carried out in 2010-11.\n\nThe government team, which included psychologists and analysts, worked with SCL in 2014 to assess how “target audience analysis” could be used by the British government.\n\nOver the course of the project in 2014, MoD officials flagged concerns over SCL’s data management, saying there were “rudimentary security mechanisms” in place.\n\nAs part of Project Duco, UK officials assessed SCL’s methods, which included analysing “psychological and anthropological principles” and assessing how these could contribute to the government’s strategic communications.\n\nOver the course of the project, SCL assessed behaviour patterns in young unmarried males and key factors affecting instability among this group.\n\nShortly after the work with DSTL, SCL delivered training for Nato, which was subsequently passed on to Georgian, Ukrainian and Moldovan government officials.\n\nAccording to an audit, SCL was paid C$999,657 (£548,000) for work on target audience analysis, including an eight-week training course for Nato staff.\n\nTarget audience analysis allows governments or companies to assess how to target individuals with a message to change behaviour.\n\nAs part of Project Duco, the MoD was given “source background detail” by SCL, which included “analysis processes, data collection plans and sampling strategies”.\n\nCambridge Analytica and SCL are under pressure over the use of Facebook data. A whistleblower has said Cambridge Analytica was provided with the disputed Facebook data in 2014.\n\nTarget audience analysis (TAA) is a controversial approach to government communications that evolved during the battle for hearts and minds in Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to an assessment of the method by the Cdr Steve Tatham of the Royal Navy in 2015, it allows governments to “diagnose the exact groupings that exist within target populations”, leading to a ranking that “depends upon the degree of influence they may have in either promoting or mitigating constructive behaviour”.\n\nIt then uses “psycho-social research parameters” in order to “determine how best to change that group’s behaviour”.\n\nAccording to Statham, the data “builds up a detailed understanding of current behaviour, values, attitudes, beliefs and norms, and examines everything from whether a group feels in control of its life to who they respect and what radio stations they listen to.” He added: “TAA can be undertaken covertly.”\n\nDuring the work with SCL, the MoD noted that “it was ascertained that some SCL staff are vetted and they have rudimentary security mechanisms in place (eg a locked cabinet).”\n\nThe report stated: “It is not thought that they have the capability to handle any electronic material above unclassified not considered the secure dissemination of documents.”\n\nAn MoD spokesman said: “We have no current relationship or contracts with SCL Group, which includes Cambridge Analytica. As such, the company has no access to any classified information.”",

    "article_text": "Former Cambridge Analytica Chief Executive Officer Alexander Nix said reports that he withdrew $8 million from his now-defunct company are untrue, and that he lied to an undercover journalist because he believed it was what \"the client wanted to hear.\"\n\nHe told a committee of British lawmakers investigating the impact of social media on recent elections Wednesday that he now has \"no involvement\" in Cambridge Analytica, which is moving through bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S., or associated companies that are under management of a court appointed administrator in the U.K.\n\nThe Financial Times reported Tuesday that investors who reportedly want to rebrand and relaunch Cambridge Analytica are in a dispute with Nix after he allegedly withdrew millions of dollars from the company shortly before it collapsed, citing people involved in the dispute.\n\n\"I saw that newspaper article,\" Nix told the British lawmakers. \"The allegations made are false. Over the last three months, since this media storm erupted, I have personally invested millions of dollars to meet staff salaries, staff bonuses and staff redundancies.\"\n\nCambridge Analytica has been embroiled in scandal over its misuse of Facebook accounts, and in March suspended Nix after he was filmed bragging about political dirty tricks. The executive was heard telling an undercover reporter posing as a potential client that he could arrange for \"Ukrainian girls\" to be used as part of a political campaign.\n\n\"That was a lie to impress the people I was talking to,\" Nix told the U.K. committee. \"We were just telling the client what we thought he wanted to hear, to find out exactly what his intentions were so we could move the conversation forward.\"\n\n\"We’ve never undertaken any work that involves a honey trap or the use of a sex scandal or anything like that for political leverage or work on a campaign,\" Nix said. \"I can’t be any more blunt than that.\"\n\nIt’s not the first time the ousted executive has given evidence to lawmakers on the same subject of Cambridge Analytica. He first appeared in February, but was recalled by Damian Collins, chairman of the committee, to speak again to clarify \"apparent inconsistencies\" in his testimony.\n\nSince the revelations in mid-March that Cambridge Analytica, the now-defunct political ad consulting firm, got data on tens of millions of Facebook users without their consent, governments in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe have been grilling executives, industry insiders and whistle-blowers to understand exactly how much information the company collects on people and what they do with it.\n\nCambridge Analytica and Nix have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg answered questions during U.S. congressional hearings in April, but has so far refused to appear before U.K. lawmakers. He hasn’t made any new friends as a result. Whistle-blower Christopher Wylie has criticized the social-media boss for rejecting the invitation \"from the one committee that will actually ask tough questions and won’t let him get away with ‘I’ll get back to you, I’ll get back to you, I’ll get back to you.’\"\n\nCambridge Analytica announced in May it would be closing its doors and filing for bankruptcy, although speculation mounted that it would be revived under a new name. Nigel Oakes, the founder of Cambridge Analytica’s British affiliate, SCL Group, denied this.\n\n— With assistance by Stephanie Baker",

Now he could face contempt charges.\n\nThe Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee published on Tuesday a series of heated exchanges between Cummings and its chairman. “I will not participate in your theatre” he wrote to Damian Collins, who has upped the ante by asking Speaker John Bercow to find time for a debate so the entire House of Commons can call on Cummings to give evidence.\n\nThe Brexit mastermind, who will be played by Benedict Cumberbatch in a forthcoming television drama, is known for his combative style and blog rants, including calling Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit strategy a “ shambles.”\n\nThe emails show Cummings lashing out against attempts to force a second referendum on Brexit: “Do you know what Vote Leave 2 would feel like for the MPs who vote for that (and donors who fund it)? It would feel like having Lawrence Taylor chasing you and smashing you into the ground over and over and over again.” Taylor is a former National Football League player.\n\nThe parliamentary panel is investigating the use of targeted online advertising during the campaign, following allegations that Facebook users’ private data may have been misused. It wants to ask Cummings about Vote Leave’s use of Aggregate IQ, an online advertising agency. The agency has been linked to SCL Group, the parent company of disgraced Cambridge Analytica, which took 40 percent of the official Brexit campaign’s budget for advertising.\n\nHere was one of the responses: “Sending a summons is the behaviour of people looking for PR, not people looking to get to the bottom of this affair. A summons will have zero positive impact on my decision and is likely only to mean I withdraw my offer of friendly cooperation, given you will have shown greater interest in grandstanding than truth-seeking, which is one of the curses of the committee system.”\n\nThe penalties for holding Parliament in contempt vary. Technically -- though very unlikely -- the Commons could call Cummings to appear before them and berate him for his behavior. That seems to be what Collins is angling for.\n\nCummings could also be issued with a fine, although this penalty hasn’t been used since 1666. As a last resort, lawmakers could threaten to send him to the clock tower of the Palace of Westminster -- more commonly known as Big Ben -- a measure not used since 1880.",

    "article_text": "The repeat grilling by the U.K. parliament’s DCMS committee today of Alexander Nix, the former CEO of the now ex company Cambridge Analytica — aka the controversial political and commercial ad agency at the center of a Facebook data misuse scandal — was not able to shed much new light on what may or may not have been going on inside the company.\n\nBut one nugget of information Nix let slip were the names of specific data aggregators he said Cambridge Analytica had bought “consumer and lifestyle” information on U.S. voters from, to link to voter registration data it also paid to acquire — apparently using that combined database to build models to target American voters in the 2016 presidential election, rather than using data improperly obtained from Facebook.\n\nThis is more information than Cambridge Analytica has thus far disclosed to one U.S. voter, professor David Carroll, who in January last year lodged a subject access request with the U.K.-based company after learning it had processed his personal information — only to be fobbed off with a partial disclosure.\n\nCarroll persisted, and made a complaint to the U.K.’s data protection watchdog, and last month the ICO ordered Cambridge Analytica to provide him with all the data it held on him. The deadline for that passed yesterday — with no response.\n\n14/ Section 7 DPA required disclosure of Axciom, Experian as data sources. SCL Election failed to disclose it. More evidence that my Subject Access Request was not adequate. This is the basis of my ICO complaint and high court claim. [break] — David Carroll 🦅 (@profcarroll) June 6, 2018\n\nThe committee questioned Nix closely over responses he had given it at his earlier appearance in February, when he denied that Cambridge Analytica used Facebook data as the foundational data set for its political ad targeting business.\n\nHe had instead said that the work Dr. Aleksandr Kogan did for the company was “fruitless” and thus that the Facebook data Kogan had harvested and supplied to it had not been used.\n\n“It wasn’t the foundational data set on which we built our company,” said Nix today. “Because we went out and we licensed millions of data points on American individuals from very large reputable data aggregators and data vendors such as Acxiom, Experian, Infogroup. That was the cornerstone of our data base together with political data — voter file data, I beg your pardon — which again is commercially available in the United States. That was the cornerstone of our company and on which we continued to build the company after we realized that the GSR data was fruitless.”\n\n“The data that Dr. Kogan gave to us was modeled data and building a model on top of a model proved to be less statistically accurate… than actually just using Facebook’s own algorithms for placing advertising communications. And that was what we found out,” he added. “So I stand by that statement that I made to you before — and that was echoed and amplified in much more technical detail by Dr. Kogan.”\n\nAnd Kogan did indeed play down the utility of the work he did for Cambridge Analytica — claiming it was essentially useless when he appeared before the committee back in April.\n\nAsked about the exact type of data Cambridge Analytica/SCL acquired and processed from data brokers, Nix told the committee: “This is largely — largely — consumer and lifestyle data. So this is data on, for instance, loyalty card data, transaction data, this is data that pertains to lifestyle choices, such as what car you drive or what magazines you read. It could be data on consumer habits. And together with some demographic and geographic data — and obviously the voter data, which is very important for U.S. politics.”\n\nWe’ve asked the three data brokers named by Nix to confirm Cambridge Analytica was a client of theirs, and the types of data it licensed from them, and will update this report with any response.\n\nFake news committee told it’s been told fake news\n\nWhat was most notable on this, Nix’s second appearance in front of the DCMS committee — which is investigating the role and impact of fake news/online disinformation on the political process — were his attempts to shift the spotlight via a string of defiant denials that there was much of a scandal to see here.\n\nHe followed a Trumpian strategy of trying to cast himself (and his former company) as victims — framing the story as a liberal media conspiracy and claiming no evidence of wrongdoing or unethical behavior had been produced.\n\nCambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, who Nix had almost certainly caught sight of sitting in the public gallery, was described as a “bitter and jealous” individual who had acted out of resentment and spite on account of the company’s success.\n\nThough the committee pushed back against that characterization, pointing out that Wylie has provided ample documents backing up his testimony, and that it has also taken evidence from multiple sources — not just from one former employee.\n\nNix did not dispute that the Facebook data-harvesting element of the scandal had been a “debacle,” as he put it.\n\nThough he reiterated Cambridge Analytica’s previous denial that it was ever the recipient of the full data set Kogan acquired from Facebook — which Facebook confirmed in April consisted of information on as many as 87 million of its users — saying it “only received data on about 26 million-27 million individuals in the USA.”\n\nHe also admitted to personally being “foolish” in what he had been caught saying to an undercover Channel 4 reporter — when he had appeared to suggest Cambridge Analytica used tactics such as honeytraps and infiltration to gain leverage against clients’ political opponents (comments that got him suspended as CEO), saying he had only been talking in hypotheticals in his “overzealousness to secure a contract” — and once again painting himself as the victim of the “skillful manipulation of a journalist.”\n\nHe also claimed the broadcaster had taken his remarks out of context, claiming too that they had heavily edited the footage to make it look worse (a claim Channel 4 phoned in to the committee to “heavily” refute during the session).\n\nBut those sole apologetic notes did not raise the tone of profound indignation Nix struck throughout almost the entire session.\n\nHe came across as poised and well-versed in his channeled outrage. Though he has of course had plenty of time since his earlier appearance — when the story had not yet become a major scandal — to construct a version of events that could best serve to set the dial to maximum outrage.\n\nNix also shut down several lines of the committee’s questions, refusing to answer whether Cambridge Analytica/SCL had gone on to repeat the Facebook data-harvesting method at the heart of the scandal themselves, for example.\n\nNor would he disclose who the owners and shareholders of Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group are — claiming in both cases that ongoing investigations prevented him from doing so.\n\nThough, in the case of the Information Commission’s Office’s ongoing investigation into social media analytics and political campaigning — which resulted in the watchdog raiding the offices of Cambridge Analytica in March — committee chair Damian Collins made a point of stating the ICO had assured it it has no objection to Nix answering its questions.\n\nNonetheless Nix declined.\n\nHe also refused to comment on fresh allegations printed in the FT suggesting he had personally withdrawn $8 million from Cambridge Analytica before the company collapsed into administration.\n\nSome answers were forthcoming when the committee pressed him on whether Aggregate IQ, a Canadian data company that has been linked to Cambridge Analytica, and which Nix described today as a “subcontractor” for certain pieces of work, had ever had access to raw data or modeled data that Cambridge Analytica held.\n\nThe committee’s likely interest in pursing that line of questioning was to try to determine whether AIQ could have gained access to the cache of Facebook user data that found its way (via Kogan) to Cambridge Analytica — and thus whether it could have used it for its own political ad targeting purposes.\n\nAIQ received £3.5 million from leave campaign groups in the run up to the U.K.’s 2016 EU referendum campaign, and has been described by leave campaigners as instrumental in securing their win, though exactly where it obtained data for targeting referendum ads has been a key question for the enquiry.\n\nOn this Nix said: “It wouldn’t be unusual for AIQ or Cambridge Analytica to work on a client’s data sets… And to have access to the data whilst we were working on them. But that didn’t entitle us to have any privileges over that data or any wherewithal to make a copy or retain any of that data ourselves.\n\n“The relationship with AIQ would not have been dissimilar to that — as a subcontractor who was brought in to assist us on projects, they would have had, possibly, access to some of the data… whether that was modeled data or otherwise. But again that would be covered by the contract relationship that we have with them.”\n\nThough he also said he couldn’t give a concrete answer on whether or not AIQ had had access to any raw data, adding: “I did speak to my data team prior to this hearing and they assured me there was no raw data that went into the Rippon platform [voter engagement platform AIQ built for Cambridge Analytica]. I can only defer to their expertise.”\n\nAlexander Nix just stated in live testimony that what I found was not raw voter data.\n\nHere's the truth: I purposely refrained from accessing the raw databases. I found the usernames, passwords, and network locations. All out in the open. — Chris Vickery (@VickerySec) June 6, 2018\n\nAlso on this, in prior evidence to the committee Facebook said it did not believe AIQ had used the Facebook user data obtained via Kogan’s apps for targeting referendum ads because the company had used email address uploads to Facebook’s ad platform for targeting “many” of its ads during the referendum — and it said Kogan’s app had not gathered the email addresses of app installers or their friends.\n\n(And in its evidence to the committee, AIQ’s COO Jeff Silvester also claimed: “The only personal information we use in our work is that which is provided to us by our clients for specific purposes. In doing so, we believe we comply with all applicable privacy laws in each jurisdiction where we work.”)\n\nToday Nix flat denied that Cambridge Analytica had played any role in the U.K.’s referendum campaign, despite the fact it was already known to have done some “scoping work” for UKIP, and which it did invoice the company for (but claims not to have been paid). Work which Nix did not deny had taken place but which he downplayed.\n\n“We undertook some scoping work to look at these data. Unfortunately, whilst this work was being undertaken, we did not agree on the terms of a contract, as a consequence the deliverables from this work were not handed over, and the invoice was not paid. And therefore the Electoral Commission was absolutely satisfied that we did not do any work for Leave.EU and that includes for UKIP,” he said.\n\n“At times we undertake eight, nine, 10 national elections a year somewhere around the world. We’ve never undertaken an election in the U.K. so I stand by my statement that the U.K. was not a target country of interest to us. Obviously the referendum was a unique moment in international campaigning and for that reason it was more significant than perhaps other opportunities to work on political campaigns might have been which was why we explored it. But we didn’t work on that campaign either.”\n\nIn a less comfortable moment for Nix, committee member Christian Matheson referred to a Cambridge Analytica document that the committee had obtained — described as a “digital overview” — and which listed “denial of service attacks” among the “digital interventions” apparently being offered by it as services.\n\nDid you ever undertake any denial of service attacks, Nix was asked?\n\n“So this was a company that we looked at forming, and we never formed. And that company never undertook any work whatsoever,” he responded. “In answer to your question, no we didn’t.”\n\nWhy did you consider it, wondered Matheson?\n\n“Uh, at the time we were looking at, uh, different technologies, expanding into different technological areas and, uh, this seemed like, uh, an interesting, uh, uh, business, but we didn’t have the capability was probably the truth to be able to deliver meaningfully in this business,” said Nix. “So.”\n\nMatheson: “Was it illegal at that time?”\n\nNix: “I really don’t know. I can’t speak to technology like that.”\n\nMatheson: “Right. Because it’s illegal now.”\n\nNix: “Right. I don’t know. It’s not something that we ever built. It’s not something that we ever undertook. Uh, it’s a company that was never realized.”\n\nMatheson: “The only reason I ask is because it would give me concern that you have the mens rea to undertake activities which are, perhaps, outside the law. But if you never went ahead and did it, fair enough.”\n\nAnother moment of discomfort for Nix was when the committee pressed him about money transfers between Cambridge Analytica/SCL’s various entities in the U.S. and U.K. — pointing out that if funds were being shifted across the Atlantic for political work and not being declared that could be legally problematic.\n\nThough he fended this off by declining to answer — again citing ongoing investigations.\n\nHe was also asked where the various people had been based when Cambridge Analytica had been doing work for U.S. campaigns and processing U.S. voters’ data — with Collins pointing out that if that had been taking place outside the U.S. it could be illegal under U.S. law. But again he declined to answer.\n\n“I’d love to explain this to you. But this again touches on some of these investigations — I simply can’t do that,” he said.",

    "article_text": "The Cambridge Analytica boss, Alexander Nix, has said he feels victimised by the media coverage that led to the collapse of his company, telling MPs his firm was unfairly destroyed by false accusations made by a “bitter and jealous” whistleblower.\n\nNix was appearing front of MPs for the first time since his business collapsed following accusations made to the Observer by former employee Christopher Wylie regarding its misuse of Facebook data, prompting a global scandal over the power of social networks.\n\nAlexander Nix blames 'global liberal media' for Cambridge Analytica collapse – live Read more\n\nHe used the appearance, which was protected from libel laws by parliamentary privilege, to say Wylie had “lied over a great many issues” and said the company had been the victim of a “coordinated and effective attack” by the “global liberal media”.\n\nNix said coverage by media outlets such as the “incredibly powerful” Guardian went viral on a global scale despite it being “false reporting in every way”, and led to the collapse of the online campaign business and parent company SCL Group in May. He claimed news coverage of his company was driven by journalists who wanted to discredit Brexit and “push for a second referendum”.\n\n“If you’re sitting where I am right now you’d probably feel quite victimised,” he told the House of Commons select committee investigating fake news.\n\nNix had already appeared in front of the committee earlier in the year but was recalled after MPs cast doubt on some of his evidence.\n\nHe apologised for claiming, during the first hearing, that his company had never held Facebook data obtained against the social network’s rules through a personality quiz run by a company founded by Dr Aleksandr Kogan of the University of Cambridge. In reality it had held the data but it had been deleted by the time he gave evidence.\n\n“Some of my answers could have been clearer but I assure you that I did not intend to mislead you,” he said. “At the time we had no reason to believe that it had been collected improperly.”\n\nNix repeatedly criticised Wylie, saying his former employee could not be trusted and had attempted to found a direct rival to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nHe said the whistleblower “purports to be a protector of data sovereignty but actually acquired a significantly larger dataset than ours and then went and tried to commercialise it in exactly the same way we did”, before spending “the last two or three years getting bitter and jealous”.\n\n“He was totally agnostic about where the money came from and even courted Russians stating that he found the idea of working with ‘crazy evil Russians’ quite intriguing.”\n\n\n\nCambridge Analytica director 'met Assange to discuss US election' Read more\n\nNix said substantial damage was done to his company by Channel 4 News’s undercover investigation, which recorded him apparently suggesting he could take down political opponents with honeytraps and bribes.\n\n\n\nThe former boss said he was caught by a “very well executed sting” but insisted it had been “heavily edited” to portray him in the worst possible light and he was only talking about hypothetical scenarios.\n\n“Chapeau to Channel 4 for destroying an excellent British technology company,” he said. Channel 4 strongly denied the accusations and insisted they had portrayed him fairly.\n\nNix insisted Wylie’s claim that Cambridge Analytica played a pivotal role in Brexit is a “groundless accusation” and insisted forthcoming investigations would ultimately conclude that his company had no involvement in the EU referendum campaign.\n\n“It is deeply troubling that this conspiracy theory has gained such traction and caused such irreversible damage to our company,” he added.\n\n“I take exception to the fact that Christopher Wylie can point-blank lie to you as he’s lied on many issues and yet I’m sitting here and being subjected to frankly ridiculous accusations based on the most tenuous claims that are simply not supported by evidence.”\n\nNix also denied claims, made in the Financial Times, that he took $8m (£6m) out of Cambridge Analytica shortly before it collapsed. He instead insisted that he was using millions of dollars of his own money to pay redundancy payments to former staff, who had lost their jobs despite political work being a relatively small proportion of the company’s work.\n\n“Most of our time is spent selling toothpaste and automotives,” he said.\n\nThe former Cambridge Analytica boss agreed to appear in front of MPs after receiving a formal summons from the committee. However, not all potential witnesses have showed the same respect to parliament.\n\nOn Thursday MPs will discuss Vote Leave campaign strategist Dominic Cummings’ refusal to appear in front of parliament. The former Michael Gove adviser, who has been increasingly critical of the government’s handling of Brexit negotiations, says MPs have no power to compel him to attend and accuses the committee of grandstanding.\n\nA source close to Cummings told the Guardian the political strategist intended to voluntarily attend parliament in order to watch MPs debate his refusal to attend parliament.\n\n“He plans to unveil a banner from the public gallery reading: ‘Where the fuck is our £350m for the NHS?’ so that he can hijack the BBC 6 [O’Clock News] for Vote Leave’s core message,” the source claimed.",

    "article_text": "In 2004, when Mark Zuckerberg was a Harvard undergrad working on a skunkworks project called The , a friend asked him how he’d managed to obtain more than 4,000 emails, photos and other bits of personal info from fellow students.\n\n“People just submitted it. I don’t know why. They ‘trust me,’” Zuckerberg wrote in an instant-messaging exchange leaked to website Silicon Alley Insider. The guy who would become CEO of one of the world’s biggest tech giants added, “Dumb f—s.”\n\nZuckerberg later expressed regret for those disdainful remarks in a 2010 New Yorker interview, saying he had “grown and learned a lot.”\n\nToday, the co-founder, now 33, is facing his toughest grown-up test yet — steering his global enterprise through a data-privacy crisis that has angered users, led panicked investors to sell the stock and drawn intense scrutiny from lawmakers and regulators worldwide.\n\nThe scandal in a nutshell: Cambridge Analytica, a U.K.-based political data analytics firm, illicitly procured the data of 50 million Facebook users — without their knowledge or consent — and then enlisted that to inform voter-targeting strategies for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign. It wasn’t a hack per se. But both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica claim they were duped by the researcher who originally harvested the data, who used an innocuous-seeming personality quiz in 2013 to access info on friends of people who used the app. That was possible because of Facebook’s then relatively lax privacy protocols.\n\nThe controversy landed like a Category 5 hurricane, to Facebook’s evident surprise. Ultimately, it may prove to be a watershed moment in how governments — the U.S. in particular — decide internet companies should be regulated after decades of laissez-faire policies.\n\nFacebook was caught asleep at the wheel, says Daniel Ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research at GBH Insights. “The Cambridge Analytica debacle has been the darkest chapter in Facebook’s 14-year history,” he says. “We view this as a seminal moment that’s going to change the nature of privacy, content and ad transparency.”\n\nThe regulatory aftershocks could rattle companies beyond Facebook. In the big M&A deals in play in the media sector — AT&T’s bid for Time Warner, Comcast’s pending acquisition of Sky, Disney’s proposed takeover of 20th Century Fox — streaming media is front and center. And everyone wants to use big data to serve up highly targeted ads over the internet, just as Facebook does. “Hundreds of billions of dollars [in digital ad spending] are at stake over the next several years over this issue,” Ives estimates.\n\nWhat Zuckerberg is compelled to do now, observers say, is continue apologizing for the mess, and Facebook needs to show it’s committed to restoring the trust of its users. As part of his mea culpa tour, Zuckerberg reportedly has decided to testify before Congress, including at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing scheduled for April 10. But in terms of regulatory expectations, the tide has irreversibly turned. In the wake of the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica revelations, the conventional wisdom is that new rules for online data are coming. And the chorus of calls for regulations curtailing the use of personal data also is sounding loudly from Silicon Valley.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook blasted Facebook’s handling of the situation, saying that “privacy to us is a human right” and noting that Apple could “make a ton of money” if it chose to monetize its customers’ data. “This is not something that we just started last week when we saw something happening. We’ve been doing this for years,” Cook said in an interview with MSNBC. While his preference is for industries to self-regulate, he said, “I think we’re beyond that here.” Responding to Cook, Zuckerberg said in an interview with Vox that he found the claim “that somehow we can’t care about you to be extremely glib” and “not at all aligned with the truth.”\n\nNBCUniversal chief Steve Burke also piled on, suggesting there’s a need to apply regulatory standards to Facebook similar to those under which the TV business has long operated. “Facebook is a gigantic business, and gigantic businesses have big responsibilities to the world,” Burke said at NBCU’s Innovation Day event for advertisers in New York. “I think the problem is exacerbated by the fact that Facebook’s business model is based on capturing data that many, many times, people don’t know they’re giving. And then selling that data, very often electronically to a buyer who Facebook doesn’t even know is a buyer.”\n\nFacebook has confronted a number of controversies in recent years. It’s been accused of failing to thwart Russia’s attempts to manipulate the 2016 U.S. election and enabling the rapid spread of “fake news.” The Facebook Live streaming service was used to broadcast a spate of shocking murders and suicides. And the tech giant is a regular punching bag for critics who say it has amassed far too much market and cultural power.\n\nBut nothing before has threatened Facebook like the Cambridge Analytica scandal. “The power of data is sometimes a hard thing to understand, and this incident woke people up to that,” says Jamie Williams, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. It’s dawning on people, she says, that Facebook “knows more about you than they would if they were wiretapping your phone.”\n\nClearly, the Trump connection cranked up the story’s volume. Facebook had already been hauled before Congress over Russia’s disinformation campaign. The exposés about Facebook data being improperly used to help Trump win the White House kicked the football squarely onto the D.C. playing field, touching off a new round of congressional hearings.\n\n“The media saw that it involved Trump, and that made it super-duper catnip,” says Scott Cleland, chairman of NetCompetition, a lobbying group funded by cable and telco providers. Cleland, a longtime critic of internet companies like Google and Facebook, believes the Cambridge Analytica matter could result in “a big leap in the direction of more accountability” for an industry he characterizes as having enjoyed an extremely light regulatory touch.\n\nIt’s evident that Facebook didn’t immediately know how to respond, or that execs thought the bad PR would blow over. On March 16, the company disclosed that it suspended Cambridge Analytica and parent company SCL Group from accessing Facebook’s platform. The story became embedded in the news cycle after reports in The New York Times and The Guardian revealed that Cambridge Analytica hadn’t entirely disposed of the ill-gotten data, as it had claimed. “We’ve been caught flat-footed,” Facebook head of news partnerships Campbell Brown said at conference less than a week later.\n\nWhen Zuckerberg finally spoke publicly, after four days on the sidelines, he stressed that these are past sins the company is addressing. He said Facebook was deceived, and that the company in 2014 changed its policies to block third-party apps’ ability to access friend data (which would have prevented the collection of the vast trove of info that wound up on Cambridge Analytica’s servers). Still, the CEO acknowledged: “It was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.” (Facebook didn’t make Zuckerberg or other senior execs available for interview for this story.)\n\nThe costs to Facebook, in both financial terms and reputation, are potentially huge. Facebook is the target of a Federal Trade Commission probe into whether it broke a 2011 agreement requiring user consent for sharing data, which carries penalties of up to $40,000 per violation. A bipartisan coalition of 41 U.S. state attorneys general last week formally requested details from Facebook about the Cambridge Analytica case, to determine if it violated consumer-protection laws. The company also faces multiple lawsuits from shareholders and users over the unauthorized data leak. Meanwhile, the selloff sparked by the news sent Facebook’s stock price down more than 17% in less than two weeks, representing a loss of more than $90 billion in market value.\n\nIn the past two weeks Facebook has detailed several steps it’s taking to set things right. The company says it will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information prior to 2014. It has announced new restrictions on developers’ data access, and it has plans to adopt “rigorous policies and terms” for third-party app developers. Facebook also says it will shut down a program over the next six months that has let marketers use data brokers like Acxiom, Epsilon and Experian to target ads based on consumers’ offline profiles. The Partner Categories program, launched in 2013, has provided ad targeting based on users’ purchasing activity or other data points (like homeownership). “While this is common industry practice, we believe this step … will help improve people’s privacy on Facebook,” product marketing director Graham Mudd said in a statement.\n\nIn another move to assuage users’ fears, the company has announced a series of updates to its privacy tools that are designed to make them easier to find and use. The updates, slated to roll out in the next few weeks, include a new section called Access Your Information that will provide a simpler way for users to manage, delete or download their posts or personal profile info. In addition, Facebook says, users will be able to more easily see info that the company uses to serve targeted advertising.\n\nFor some, though, Facebook’s response is too little, too late. In a worrisome trend for the company, the momentum behind the #DeleteFacebook movement has gained steam. Last week, actor-comedian Will Ferrell and Playboy separately said they were terminating their Facebook accounts over the Cambridge Analytica issue. A week earlier, tech billionaire Elon Musk summarily axed the Facebook pages for two of his companies, Tesla Motors and SpaceX, after Twitter users called his attention to their existence. And Brian Acton, a co-founder of messaging app WhatsApp — which Facebook acquired in a deal valued at $19 billion — called for a boycott in a tweet: “It is time. #deletefacebook.”\n\nAll the same, most Wall Street analysts believe Facebook will make it through the tempest without serious long-term damage. Some even see the stock plunge as a golden buying opportunity for a company that throws off tons of cash and has continued to grow at an astonishing rate. For 2017, Facebook posted revenue of $40.7 billion (up 47%) and net income of $15.9 billion (up 56%).\n\n“I don’t think it’s fatal,” says media analyst Michael Nathanson, who maintains a “buy” rating on Facebook. “They will be subject to new regulations … but I don’t see it affecting the core business model.”\n\nOnly about 5% total of Facebook’s revenue is generated by large brand advertisers who may be motivated to pull their spending, according to Jack Myers, chairman of ad industry research company MediaVillage. Up to 80% of Facebook’s sales come from the 6 million small and midsize businesses that buy direct-marketing ads on the social service, while an estimated 15% is generated through programmatic transactions.\n\n“I don’t want to minimize the danger to Facebook,” Myers says. “If there’s anything being hidden that surfaces, that could have an impact. But right now, I don’t think the issues are going to have a material effect on their ad revenue.”\n\nInvestors will be watching for signs of significant user and advertiser flight when Facebook reports first-quarter 2018 earnings in early May.\n\nThe biggest risk to Facebook — and the digital-ad business overall — would be a wide-ranging privacy-protection law on the order of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act in the banking sector. That established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, designed to keep predatory lenders in check, along with a host of new regulations. “If you have financial services-style regulation, in an industry that hasn’t really seen regulation since its inception, that would be a cyclone for Facebook and the industry,” says GBH’s Ives.\n\nHowever, the introduction of sweeping data-privacy legislation at the federal level is unlikely in 2018, given the focus on midterm elections, says Michael Morgan, a partner with McDermott Will & Emery and leader of the law firm’s global privacy and cybersecurity practice. “There aren’t many signs coming out of this Congress that would suggest they want to focus a lot of attention on consumer privacy.”\n\nBut Zuckerberg has seen the writing on the wall. “I’m not sure we shouldn’t be regulated,” Zuckerberg said in a March 21 interview with CNN. “I actually think the question is more, ‘What is the right regulation?’” The focus for Facebook will be to ensure whatever laws come to pass don’t significantly disrupt its bottom line. In the interview, he also said Facebook supports ad-transparency tools that would provide the types of disclosures required by pending Senate bills.\n\nRegulatory officials examine files at Cambridge Analytica’s London offices.\n\nSipa USA via AP\n\nWhen companies conduct a cost-benefit analysis on whether to adopt stronger user-privacy controls or other enhanced security, they often opt to do nothing — as long as the potential fines or remediation costs are in a tolerable range, according to Gregory Garrett, head of international cybersecurity for consulting firm BDO: “Companies typically do as little as they can, to maximize profitability and reduce costs of complying with regulations.”\n\nIn fact, Facebook is boosting spending to combat bad actors on its platform, and Zuckerberg warned investors last November that increased spending on “preventing abuse on our platforms” would “significantly impact our profitability going forward.” As part of that, Facebook has said it expects to double the size of its safety and security-monitoring team by the end of 2018, to 20,000 staffers.\n\nWhether Facebook’s actions will be enough to satisfy all constituents — including a passel of congressional reps — that it has plugged its privacy holes and is a good corporate citizen remains to be seen. “We’re living in a really politicized time,” says Michael Priem, CEO of ad agency Modern Impact. “The market’s freaking out about Facebook. But it really comes down to one thing: It’s testing the thesis of how much trust there is between consumers and platforms.”\n\nIn the near term, Facebook and other tech companies will be forced to comply with stricter European privacy protections. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect May 25, requires companies to obtain consent before collecting data from consumers. It also gives consumers the right to learn what companies know about them and even ask a company like Facebook to delete photos or any other data it may have.\n\nNoncompliance can be expensive: The maximum fine is up to 4% of a company’s global revenue, which would be $1.6 billion for Facebook, based on the company’s 2017 results.\n\nTechnically, GDPR applies only to services offered to EU residents. But given the global nature of many online services as well as the increased focus on privacy, it’s likely that some of the new rules will be implemented for U.S. users. It’s also worth noting that GDPR, first drafted in early 2012, passed despite heavy lobbying against it by big tech companies.\n\nEventually, American legislators may take their cues from the EU. “The U.S. government is likely to draft a watered-down version of GDPR after the upcoming midterms,” Barclays analyst Ross Sandler predicted in a recent research note.\n\nBefore that happens, some states may move forward with more rigorous data-handling laws. In California, voters will decide the fate of a privacy-focused ballot measure in November. The California Consumer Privacy Act would make data collection more transparent and give consumers a way to opt out of companies selling their data. “We’re trying to do a commonsense reform,” says real estate developer Alastair Mactaggart, who’s spearheading the initiative.\n\nThe California Chamber of Commerce, which is organizing the opposition to the ballot initiative, argues that it would pose “grave risks to the business community and potentially the state’s economy.” Mactaggart dismisses the claims: “They’re just defending business as usual.”\n\nSome contend that these days, “business as usual” should factor into the potential costs of data breaches — regardless of the letter of the law. “It boggles the mind,” says Garrett, “that a company that should be super sophisticated at information management would let personal information on 50 million users be accessed by an unauthorized party.”\n\nJanko Roettgers contributed to this report.",

Both Cambridge Analytica and SCL Elections (the SCL Group subsidiary connected to Cambridge Analytica) will now close their doors.\n\nDuring the call, Wheatland said that the board determined that rebranding the company’s offerings in the current environment is “futile.”\n\nCambridge Analytica and the SCL Group have offices in London, New York City, Arlington, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. The conference call was originally scheduled for Tuesday morning, but was repeatedly pushed back until early Wednesday afternoon, ultimately getting rescheduled more than half a dozen times.\n\nScreenshots from the company’s internal chat service obtained by Gizmodo show a darkly comic mood in anticipation of the call. One employee shared bleakly titled Spotify playlists in Slack featuring songs like “High and Dry” by Radiohead, “The End” by The Doors, and “Help!” by The Beatles. Another employee posted a still from Titanic showing the ship’s band playing their instruments as the vessel sinks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn explaining the decision to close the offices, Wheatland cited the ongoing investigations into Cambridge Analytica’s massive data harvesting scandal, damage to the company’s reputation, and loss of clients. In March, Britain’s information commissioner announced that she was seeking a warrant to investigate any misconduct by the data analytics firm, looking to search both its offices and its servers. UK authorities raided the London office later that month, but have yet to release their findings. Meanwhile, embattled former CEO Alexander Nix refused to testify before the British Parliamentary media committee regarding the firm’s misuse of Facebook user data.\n\nWe have reached out to Cambridge Analytica for more information and will update this story if we hear back.\n\nUpdate 2:10pm: Speaking to The Wall Street Journal, SCL Group founder Nigel Oakes confirmed that both Cambridge Analytica and the SCL Group are shutting down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUpdate 3:10pm: In a press release, Cambridge Analytica announced that it, SCL Elections, and other affiliate companies have filed for insolvency in the UK, with bankruptcy proceedings in the US to follow.\n\n“Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, which view is now fully supported by [a third-party audit], the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers,” states the release. “As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.”\n\nUpdate 4:56pm: Asked for clarification, The Wall Street Journal confirmed that Oakes said the entire SCL Group—not just subsidiary SCL Elections—was shutting down.

    "article_text": "Cambridge Analytica, an offshoot of the Scl Group (a private British behavioural research and strategic communication company) has been in the news for all the wrong reasons. Whistleblower ex-employee 28-year-old Chris Wylie revealed how the company had harvested and passed on personal Facebook data without account holders' permission. This data was then used to run targeted 'fake news' campaigns during the US presidential election.\n\nSubsequent to Wylie's disclosures, a channel 4 documentary showed Cambridge Analytica bosses boasting about entrapping candidates, influencing election-outcomes, and creating fake news stories for the benefit of their clients.\n\nICO finally get a warrant to search Cambridge Analytica offices\n\nAfter the Channel 4 programme was aired, the information officer, Elizabeth Denham, requested a warrant to search CA offices. On Monday night, staff from the security firm Stroz Friedberg, who was at CA offices on behalf of Facebook, were told to leave by the ICO. This was to prevent a Facebook CA audit from prejudicing the ICO investigation.\n\nIt took several hours in court over the course of several days, however, before the judge presiding over the case finally granted the search warrant. According to observers for The Register, both sides were trying to agree on the scope of the warrant, most importantly, whether the ICO would also get access to data relating to Cambridge Analytica's parent company SCL Elections Ltd.\n\nOn Friday night, eighteen ICO enforcement officers entered the CA London office to carry out the 7-hour search, which was finally completed at 3 am on Saturday morning.\n\nTop Videos of the Day\n\nThe procurement and use of Facebook data by the app developer Dr Aleksander Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and by the SCL Group lies at the heart of the ICO investigation.\n\nConcerns have arisen that personal data was passed on and used to influence the outcome of the American presidential election and the EU referendum.\n\nFacebook under fire\n\nFacebook shares have suffered a significant drop in value in light of these revelations. Responding to intense media pressure, Mark Zuckerberg finally made a statement on the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Speaking to CNN, he apologised for his company's role in the scandal.\n\nThe spotlight falls on Vote Leave\n\nWhile the initial outrage centred around CA's role in influencing the outcome of the US presidential election, recent days have seen many observers shifting the spotlight onto the prominent pro-Brexit campaign group Vote Leave. According to a Reuters report, both the head of CA and the head of Vote Leave had boasted about their collaboration during the Brexit referendum campaign.\n\nSince then, both have withdrawn these claims, emphasising that no contract had been signed.\n\nHowever, whistleblower Shahmir Sanni who was part of the BeLeave campaign team said:\"I know... Vote Leave cheated.\"\n\nBrexit campaign was ‘totally illegal’, Vote Leave whistleblower claims. #TheBrexitWhistleblower\n\n\n\nWATCH THE FULL STORY: https://t.co/xFdLvol74R — Channel 4 News (@Channel4News) March 25, 2018\n\nIt is now up to the electoral commission to continue its investigations and determine whether these allegations are true.\n\nCA, SCL, and Robert Mercer\n\nDuring the last few days, commentators have also been investigating and highlighting the relationships and the people behind CA and its parent company SCL. The name Robert Mercer features prominently as he appears to be the main financier of Cambridge Analytica. The US hedge fund billionaire and Trump supporter is known to have financially supported the Trump Campaign. In the UK, CA's parent company SCL has several conservative donors among its directors and shareholders.\n\nThe Guardian reported that while the government maintains it now has no contacts with SCL, the company worked on two different projects for the Ministry of Defence.\n\nPressure on Facebook rather than politicians\n\nPoliticians across the globe have been pointing the finger at Facebook, denouncing its failure to protect user data. In contrast, politicians appear unwilling to examine the way political campaigns are run in the age of social media.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON ― Before the scandal broke over their improper use of Facebook user data, British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica and its parent, SCL Group, plied their trade of political subterfuge for clients in developing countries.\n\nCall it techno-colonialism — the idea that the leaner parts of the world are where you go to conduct your beta tests. Like so much else about Cambridge Analytica and SCL, they were merely putting a sinister flourish on something the tech industry does as a matter of course. The most obvious example comes from the company that most wants to distance itself from Cambridge Analytica: Facebook.\n\nBack in 2015, the social media giant faced a wave of criticism for deploying a new program in India, called Free Basics, that handed out mobile phones to the poor that operated only Facebook products. One of the company’s defenders, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, blurted out on Twitter, “Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?” (He would later apologize.)\n\nBut the kerfuffle didn’t stop Facebook from continuing to treat smaller and developing countries as its corporate testing ground.\n\nIn the fall of 2017, Facebook decided to run a test in six countries ― Bolivia, Cambodia, Guatemala, Serbia, Slovakia and Sri Lanka ― that split users’ feeds into two separate streams of posts. One was devoted to updates from family and friends; the other to official pages of organizations like news sites and political figures. No one from Facebook told anyone in those countries the company would be running this experiment. News publishers were left in dark. So were non-governmental organizations, political parties and activists.\n\nLuke MacGregor / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nThe result was a nightmare. News publishers, particularly smaller, independent media, immediately noticed a collapse in traffic to their sites. NGOs that relied on Facebook to communicate with the people they were trying to serve saw their online interactions evaporate. Activists similarly found that their messages had disappeared from the main feed.\n\nFacebook’s goal was to see whether filtering news and politics into a separate feed would increase “meaningful conversations,” a vague metric that has nonetheless guided how the company is changing its algorithm to combat the spread of propaganda on its site. Had the experiment gone well, the product change might have been brought to larger, wealthier nations. But it didn’t go well and Facebook ended it on March 1.\n\nPeople in the original six countries were left to wonder why they were the guinea pigs. Fabiola Chambi, web editor for the Bolivian newspaper Los Tiempos, told The New York Times that she wanted to know, “Why Bolivia?”\n\n“We don’t have any way to hold [Facebook] accountable either, aside from calling it out publicly,” Stefan Dojcinovic, editor-in-chief of the Serbian site KRIK, wrote in an op-ed. “Maybe that’s why it has chosen to experiment with this new feature in small countries far removed from the concerns of most Americans.”\n\nFilip Struharik, an editor at Slovakia’s Denník N, wrote, “Facebook would not dare undertake such crazy experiments in big countries like Germany. There it would not only face exponentially larger resistance, but would also risk politicians responding with a push for tough regulation.”\n\nCambridge Analytica and SCL went gallivanting about the struggling world, too ― although unlike Facebook, they were explicit about wanting to affect events on the ground.\n\nThe company bragged about running a voter suppression campaign for a political party in Nigeria’s 2007 election, which election observers said suffered from extreme levels of fraud, violence and intimidation. The Guardian reported that Cambridge Analytica was even offered the hacked emails of Muhammadu Buhari, the opposition politician running against their client, President Goodluck Jonathan, in Nigeria’s 2015 election.\n\nThe firm’s leaders have admitted to running a campaign in Latvia to heighten divisions between ethnic Latvians and ethnic Russians for political purposes.\n\nAn undercover sting by reporters at U.K. Channel 4 revealed the power Cambridge Analytica had in Kenya, where it worked on three successive elections that were marred by a barrage of divisive digital propaganda and disinformation favoring President Uhuru Kenyatta’s ruling Jubilee Party.\n\nStringer / Reuters Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga (center) lost three successive elections to Uhuru Kenyatta, who had hired Cambridge Analytica.\n\n“We have rebranded the entire party twice, written their manifesto, done two rounds of 50,000 surveys,” Mark Turnbull, managing director of Cambridge Analytica’s political division, told undercover reporters in speaking about his firm’s work for the Jubilee Party. “Then we’d write all the speeches and we’d stage the whole thing. So just about every element of his campaign.”\n\nThe elections on which Cambridge Analytica worked in African nations shared fear-based themes that would now be recognizable to anyone in the U.S. Kenyans were warned in ads that the election of opposition leader Raila Odinga would lead to an invasion of Ethiopian refugees, attacks from Somalian terrorists and an epidemic of disease. In Nigeria, Cambridge Analytica cooked up a video that claimed electing Buhari would mean “Sharia for all.”",

    "article_text": "She described the SCL group’s compartmentalized operations, worldwide penetration of political markets and how she had been approached by intelligence agents.\n\nCambridge Analytica’s former Director of Program Development Brittany Kaiser testified before the Fake News inquiry for the UK Parliament’s Select Committee on Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. She left the company earlier this year due to competing work commitments, and came forward after recent media coverage about Cambridge Analytica’s practices. In Kaiser’s view, fake news “undermines democracy and universal human rights,\" and “using tech to take advantage of people’s openness” is an “abuse of power”.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: Dirty Tricks or Black Ops? The Secret World of Cambridge Analytica\n\n\n\nChinese Walls\n\nKaiser first met Alexander Nix in 2013 and joined the company in late 2014, though she was told that her job title was “up to me” to decide. Nix persuaded her to put aside her doctoral thesis – partly based on the Iraq War Logs released by Wikileaks – to go full-time with the company in early 2015.\n\nHer first customers unnamed wealthy Nigerians who were worried that presidential candidate Muhammadu Buhari might win the election. She confirmed much of Christopher Wylie’s testimony, saying that they produced ultra-violent videos that they pushed on social media to try to whip up fear and opposition to Buhari. However, Kaiser contradicted Wylie, saying that the Israeli firm that were also hired by the same people was not Black Cube, but another company whose name she could not recall.\n\nIn her testimony Kaiser described how everyone who worked for one of the various SCL companies “worked for SCL Group”, that “most staff were shared between [the different SCL companies” and that “No one worked for Cambridge Analytica”. Repeatedly she explained to the committee that while she believed that Aggregate IQ was just another local office of the SCL Group that she was “never privy to the corporate structure.”\n\nDespite this fluid arrangement the working practices were highly compartmentalized, with Kaiser often little more than a “glorified salesperson” who pitched their services to clients. Others then came in and delivered the services, from data analytics on potential voters to “weaponized messaging” and media production. Kaiser testified that she usually only found out about the specifics of projects after they happened.\n\n\n\nThe EU Referendum\n\nMuch of the two and a half hours of questions were devoted to Cambridge Analytica’s role in the EU referendum.\n\nKaiser explained that she met with representatives from UKIP, the Leave.eu campaign and two insurance companies owned by Leave.eu founder Arron Banks. In what she called “Phase One” they took data from UKIP members and surveys the party had carried out, and provided analysis and advice to the Leave.eu campaign on social media messaging and door-to-door canvassing techniques.\n\nWorking with others, Kaiser then drew up an elaborate “Phase Two” program including analysing much larger datasets and micro-targeting ads via facebook, as the company had done for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign. But the bill for the first phase – some £41,500 – was never paid, and Kaiser cited media reports saying that Banks had taken the data and the Phase Two plan she had drawn up and founded their own company – Big Data Dolphins – to do it for themselves. She also talked of recent reports that Banks donated £42,000 to UKIP to pay Cambridge Analytica for their initial work, but that the money had never made it to the company.\n\nSo Brittany Kaiser's DCMS testimony is worth a read, then. pic.twitter.com/0xp0iL5urz — Hugo Rifkind (@hugorifkind) 17 April 2018\n\nKaiser was asked whether the Phase One work that Cambridge Analytica did for the Leave.eu campaign was reported by those involved, even though it went unpaid. She replied, “I don’t believe our work was reported by anyone – not by Leave.eu, not by UKIP and not by Cambridge Analytica.” Along with the issue of the Leave.eu campaign allegedly taking the data provided by UKIP and having it analysed abroad – both in contravention in British data protection laws – Kaiser described the situation as “something you might be interested in looking into.”\n\nBrittany Kaiser's written evidence shows the \"complimentary workstreams\" that Cambridge Analytica proposed to https://t.co/hdWfkJEHVU and tells @CommonsCMS \"I do believe that this work was carried out, just not by Cambridge Analytica.\" pic.twitter.com/9uvbPMWo38 — Damian Collins (@DamianCollins) 17 April 2018\n\n​Intelligence Agents?\n\nCambridge Analytica’s work took Kaiser all over the world – she mentioned working in Nigeria, Ethiopa, Lithuania, Malaysia and Mexico. This led one of the committee members to ask whether she had ever worked for or with any intelligence agency, given the nature of her job. Kaiser initially said no, but then explained that whenever she returned from one of these countries, “I briefed the State Department on where I’d been, who I’d met with.”\n\nWhen the committee inquired as to whether the Israeli consultants she helped her Nigerian customers hire for the 2015 election could have been former Mossad agents, Kaiser hedged, saying “They could have been”. She was then asked if she had ever been approached by intelligence agents and Kaiser explained that her grandfather had worked in US military intelligence for 27 years. She said that her grandfather told her how to identify when she was being approached by a government agent, saying, “I believe that I have, though they would not properly identify themselves, but I know what to look out for, and to say no.”",

It's not enough to just make powerful tools, we need to make sure that these tools are used for good,\" he said.\n\n\"We're hard at work making sure people don't misuse our platform.\"\n\nAfter Trump won the White House in 2016, in part with the firm's help, Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix went to more clients to pitch his services, the New York Times reported last year.\n\nThe company boasted it could develop psychological profiles of consumers and voters which was a \"secret sauce'' it used to sway them more effectively than traditional advertising could.\n\nOne unanswered question in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation into whether there was any collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia is whether Russia's Internet Research Agency or Russian intelligence used data Cambridge Analytica obtained from Facebook or other sources to help target and time anti-Hillary Clinton, pro-Trump and politically and racially divisive messages during the election.\n\nFormer White House aide Steve Bannon was a former vice president of the London-based firm, and Mueller has asked it to provide internal documents about how its data and analyses were used in the Trump campaign, according to sources familiar with the investigation.\n\nThe full statement by Cambridge Analytica:\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the Company’s efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas.\n\n\"In light of those accusations, noted Queen’s Counsel Julian Malins was retained to conduct an independent investigation into the allegations regarding the Company’s political activities.\n\n\"Mr Malins report, which the Company posted on its website today, concluded that the allegations were not “borne out by the facts.”\n\nRegarding the conclusions set forth in his report, Mr Malins stated:\n\n“I had full access to all members of staff and documents in the preparation of my report.\n\n\"My findings entirely reflect the amazement of the staff, on watching the television programmes and reading the sensationalistic reporting, that any of these media outlets could have been talking about the company for which they worked.\n\n\"Nothing of what they heard or read resonated with what they actually did for a living.”\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nDespite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, which view is now fully supported by Mr. Malins’ report, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers.\n\nAs a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the Company into administration.\n\nWhile this decision was extremely painful for Cambridge Analytica’s leaders, they recognize that it is all the more difficult for the Company’s dedicated employees who learned today that they likely would be losing their jobs as a result of the damage caused to the business by the unfairly negative media coverage.\n\nDespite the Company’s precarious financial condition, Cambridge Analytica intends to fully meet its obligations to its employees, including with respect to notice periods, severance terms, and redundancy entitlements.\n\nEvidence given to MPs by Cambridge Analytica whistleblower:\n\nCambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie told MPs in March about the mysterious death of his predecessor in a Kenyan hotel room.\n\nMr Wylie was giving evidence to a parliamentary committee about his role in helping the data firm harvest tens of millions of Facebook profiles.\n\nBut he said he only learned months after taking the job at the firm that his predecessor, Dan Muresan had died.\n\nAdmitting what he was about to say was \"pure speculation\", he revealed what he \"had heard\" happened to Mr Muresan.\n\nHe said: \"What I heard was that he was working on some kind of deal of some sort, I'm not sure what kind of deal it is.\n\n\"But when you work for senior politicians in a lot of these countries you don't actually make money in the electoral work, you make money in the influence brokering after the fact - and that a deal went sour.\n\n\"Again, this is what I've been told, so I'm not saying this as a matter of fact, but people suspected that he was poisoned in his hotel room.\"",

Although Carroll is a US citizen, he is entitled to a copy of his data under European Law, as it was processed in the UK. He has now taken the case to the European Parliament. SCL Group shut down last month, but the ICO made it clear at the time that this would not suspend the obligation of the company, its staff and directors to cooperate with ongoing or future investigations.\n\n1.4 billion years ago, a day on Earth lasted just 18 hours and 41 minutes, according to a new paper that pulls together astronomical data and geochemical analyses of ancient rocks (The Guardian). Since the Precambrian era, the length of a day has grown by one 74 thousandth of a second every year, due to the very gradually slowing rotation speed of the Earth. Meanwhile, the Moon has drifted 44,000km further away from the planet's surface.\n\nRead next Thursday briefing: Waymo's self-driving cars have travelled 7 million miles Thursday briefing: Waymo's self-driving cars have travelled 7 million miles\n\nDespite YouTube's assurances that it would fix algorithms that were incorrectly flagging personal and educational LGBT+ videos as adult content, YouTubers are still seeing their content age-restricted and demonetized (The Verge). Trans YouTuber Chase Ross highlights that including the very word \"transgender\" in the title triggered a video's automatic demonetization as \"not suitable for most advertisers\". A YouTube representative responded that the company's machine learning based flagging systems sometimes \"get it wrong\" and that \"successful appeals ensure that our systems get better\". Adding insult to injury, as we enter Pride month, LGBT+ creators are seeing homophobic adverts attached to videos that have not been demonetized, in breach of YouTube policies against discriminatory and hateful content.\n\nIn China, the government is developing a \"social credit\" system partly based on people’s routine behaviours with the ultimate goal of raising the \"trustworthiness\" of the country’s 1.4 billion citizens (WIRED). It might sound like a futuristic dystopian nightmare but the system is already a reality. The social credit system is already preventing people from buying airline and train tickets, stopping social gatherings from happening, and let men with high scores contact women on dating websites.

    "article_text": "On the morning of June 5, 2017, Qataris woke up to the shocking news that their country was under blockade. The hostile move came from none other than its Arab neighbours and cofounders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC): Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain, along with their ally, Egypt. The so-called quartet abruptly cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar and imposed travel and trade bans.\n\nThe \"shock and awe\" strategy was meant to precipitate the collapse of the Qatari government, or at least its capitulation. Thirteen demands were presented to Qatar. They included shutting down the Al Jazeera media network, reducing diplomatic relations with Iran, and closing a Turkish military base near Doha.\n\nQatar was also asked to pay reparations for years of alleged damages caused by its policies to the blockading countries.\n\nIt was disclosed later that the quartet had also considered military action against Qatar but the US Department of Defense, which has its largest military base in the Middle East in Qatar, had warned against it.\n\nQatar was taken by surprise by the Saudi-led diplomatic offensive and was unprepared for such a major escalation. However, the blockade largely failed to bring down the country and has made Doha that much more resilient.\n\nWhy Qatar was caught off guard on June 5, 2017\n\nBefore the blockade was imposed on June 5 last year, tensions flared within the GCC had already flared once before. In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain withdrew their ambassadors from Doha, claiming that Qatar had not implemented a security pact for \"non-interference\" in their internal affairs.\n\nDoha's independent foreign policy had irritated Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. However, the lack of sympathy from the Obama administration prevented Saudi Arabiaand the UAE from taking further action against Qatar.\n\nQatar may have incurred heavy financial costs as a result of the blockade - estimated at $43bn by Bloomberg - but it has become more independent than ever.\n\nDoha also opted for reconciliation at that time, with the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, seeking to have a fresh start with his neighbours. Hence, after the Riyadh agreement was concluded in November 2014, the three GCC countries returned their ambassadors to Doha and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, UAE and Bahrain attended the annual GCC summit in the Qatari capital in December 2014.\n\nWhen the Saudi-led coalition launched an offensive against the Houthi rebels in 2015, Qatar sent troops to Yemen to support it. In January 2016, Qatar also withdrew its ambassador from Tehran in an act of solidarity with Saudi Arabia, following an attack by angry protesters on the Saudi embassy in Tehran. The Qatari government also considered providing financial support for the ailing Bahraini economy. Both Prime Minister of Bahrain, Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa and Bahraini Crown Prince Salman Al Khalifa paid separate visits to Doha in February and March 2017 to discuss how Qatar can help in this matter.\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nIn short, the view from Doha was that relations with the three GCC countries were improving at a steady pace after the resolution of the 2014 crisis.\n\nIt turned out that what was perceived in 2014 to be the turning of a new page between the three GCC countries was nothing more than a short respite. Failing to secure the backing of the then-Obama administration, the blockading countries decided to bury the hatchet temporarily and wait for another opportunity to take care of unfinished business with Qatar, which they claim goes back over 20 years.\n\nDonald Trump's victory in the 2016 US presidential elections changed the picture dramatically. With a new president in the White House willing to back them, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were encouraged to resume the conflict and bring it to a decisive conclusion.\n\nWhy the blockade did not achieve the intended result\n\nDespite all the pressure, however, Qatar, and to the surprise of many, decided to fight back. After surviving the initial shock, it launched a coordinated diplomatic effort.\n\nThe key objective was to freeze the conflict and prevent further hostile actions by the blockading countries. The focus of the campaign was Washington. After months of hard work, Qatar succeeded in changing the position of President Trump.\n\nMore importantly, Qatar won a solid US commitment towards its security. Following the first US-Qatar annual strategic dialogue in Washington, on January 30, 2018, the US Department of State issued a statement, expressing its desire \"to work jointly with Qatar to deter and confront any external threat to Qatar's territorial integrity that is inconsistent with the United Nations Charter\".\n\n{articleGUID}\n\nOn a different front, Qatar implemented a military agreement with Turkey, signed during the 2014 crisis, allowing for the expansion of Turkey's military presence in Qatar. And as a result of being forced to reroute flights to and from Doha through Iranian airspace, Qatar sent back its ambassador to Tehran.\n\nIn addition, cutting off supply routes through the blockading countries made Iran Qatar's only access to secure food, water and medicine supplies. The trade balance between the two countries dramatically increased as a result, reaching $2bn over the past year.\n\nThe whole crisis has hence ended up producing the exact opposite result of the one intended by the blockading countries. Instead of reducing Qatar's ties with Iran, it led to strengthening them, while Turkey has, for the first time, become part of Gulf security, through its military presence in Qatar. Al Jazeera is still on the air and continues to broadcast critical reports about the quartet.\n\nEven the multi-million-dollar Saudi-UAE PR campaign to tarnish the image of Qatar and link it to activities related to financing terrorism has failed to produce the intended effects. The two GCC countries waged a covert information war to demonise Qatar and precipitate a shift in US policy towards it. They hired PR firms, lobbying groups, and paid think tanks to hold anti-Qatar public events.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the UAE also employed political consulting firms, such as a subsidiary of SCL Group, the parent company of the political-research firm Cambridge Analytica, to lead an anti-Qatar media campaign. These efforts produced little impact, however. Qatar circumvented them by signing an agreement with the US in July 2017 aimed at combating the financing of terrorism.\n\nIndeed, Qatar may have incurred heavy financial costs as a result of the blockade - estimated at $43bn by Bloomberg - but it has become more independent than ever. In fact, most Qataris believe today that they have achieved their real independence.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial stance.",

    "article_text": "The US branches of Cambridge Analytica and its parent firm SCL have filed for bankruptcy as execs inch closer to ridding themselves of the toxic brand.\n\nThe filings, submitted to the New York Southern Bankruptcy Court late yesterday, are for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy – akin to liquidation in the UK – which allows the debtor to escape without having to file a repayment plan*.\n\nCambridge Analytica is the firm at the heart of the Facebook data harvesting scandal, which hit headlines following revelations that it bought user data from a Cambridge Uni academic, Aleksandr Kogan.\n\nThe Social Network has come under fire for broad developer policies that allowed the mass slurp of users' friends' data, but has insisted that Kogan is at fault because the terms didn't allow him to pass that data on.\n\nMeanwhile, Cambridge Analytica and its parent firm SCL were hit by further scandal when Channel 4 News filmed their director, Alexander Nix, appearing to offer up honey-traps, bribes and more to reporters posing as prospective clients.\n\nThe affair has – unsurprisingly – tainted Cambridge Analytica's name and, despite previous insistence that everything was fine, the company this month confirmed it was shutting down, complaining that it had been \"vilified\" for legal and commonplace online marketing activities.\n\nThe proceedings started in the UK, where Cambridge Analytica and its various affiliates filed for insolvency on 2 May.\n\nThe latest US filings offer up more detail on the firms, showing that Cambridge Analytica has estimated assets (PDF) of between $100,001 and $500,000 and estimated liabilities of $1m to $10m, with between one and 49 creditors.\n\nIts affiliate, SCL USA Inc (PDF), has between 50 and 99 creditors, estimated assets of up to $50,000 and estimated liabilities of between $1m and $10m.\n\nThe web-like nature of the businesses, which were founded by a similar set of people, have been one of the more confusing aspects of the firms' operations, and the filings list the various names and affiliations.\n\nAffiliate companies in the UK are listed as: SCL Group Ltd; SCL Analytics Ltd; SCL Commercial Ltd; SCL Social Ltd; SCL Elections Ltd; and Cambridge Analytica (UK) Ltd – all of which filed for insolvency on 2 May.\n\nOther names used by Cambridge Analytica US LLC are listed as: Cambridge Analytica Commercial LLC; Cambridge Analytica Political LLC; and Anaxi Solutions Inc.\n\nHowever, as previously reported, a number of the execs behind the embattled firms have already set up their next outfit, Emerdata.\n\nThat company, incorporated in August 2017, gives its activities as \"data processing, hosting and related activities\" on the Companies House website, a repository of UK companies.\n\nIt was set up by Julian Wheatland – the chairman of SCL Group, who signed the bankruptcy filing for Cambridge Analytica US – as the director.\n\nHe and Alexander Tayler – who had a short-lived stint as CEO of Cambridge Analytica UK when Nix was nixed – are both listed as initial shareholders in the incorporation statement, but their statuses as \"persons with significant control\" were ceased at the end of February. (Presumably that was about the time The Observer started asking the business for comment on the story that kicked the drama off, which it published on 17 March.)\n\nShortly after, just as the furore hit, three others with no previous positions at Cambridge Analytica or its affiliates were named directors – Ahmad Ashraf Hosny al Khatib, Cheng Peng and Johnson Chun Shun Ko. Rebekah Mercer and Jennifer Mercer, daughters of billionaire Cambridge Analytica backer Robert Mercer, were later added to the list.\n\nMeanwhile, Nix and Tayler's positions as directors at the firm were both terminated – although Wheatland remains listed as an active director – and Cambridge Analytica has no active listings of people with significant control.\n\nHowever, Tayler remains an active director of another firm, Firecrest, which was incorporated on 7 March and briefly also had Nix listed as a director. Its work is described as \"business and domestic software development\", and lists Emerdata Ltd as a \"person with significant control\" over it.\n\n*Bootnote\n\nIn the US, Chapter 13 requires the filing of a plan for repayment – the debtor must pay all or part of his debts from future income over three to five years.\n\nChapter 11 is used by large businesses for reorganisation, while Chapter 12 is for farmers or fishermen with regular annual income to reorganise debts and continue operations. ®\n\nSponsored: Minds Mastering Machines - Call for papers now open",

A recent Thomson Reuters survey found that more than a quarter of survey participants are actually using Facebook more, eMarketer reported.\n\nIn addition, 18 percent of users report using the service less, while only 1 percent reported deleting their accounts. Even so, some Facebook users appear to be thinking twice before posting. When asked why they were sharing less content on Facebook, 47 percent of surveyed Facebook users said privacy concerns were holding them back.\n\nFacebook’s Vice President of Global Marketing Solutions Carolyn Everson knows these concerns. And, though user privacy and targeting can exist together, Everson believes that Facebook needs to educate users. It has to provide them with “full control of how that advertising experience — and the overall experience with their own data — plays out,” Everson recently told eMarketer.\n\nThe news comes weeks after news surfaced that Cambridge Analytica improperly collected personal data from Facebook users, which was reportedly used to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump. As far as Cambridge Analytica is concerned, the firm has made some pretty big claims — namely, that it can take raw personality data from a subset of voters and develop complex models of individuals, which campaigns can then use to target and micro-target voter communities to help move elections their way.\n\nThe firm’s most specific (and biggest) claim, however, is that it conducted this advanced voter modeling for the Trump organization during the 2016 election — and that it was on the strength of those data models that Trump was able to turn swing states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, from blue to red.\n\nAs those claims circulated, U.S. legislators asked Mark Zuckerberg to testify about Cambridge Analytica’s alleged misuse of the social media platform’s data. Zuckerberg appeared before the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce on April 11, Reuters reported.\n\nAlso, in May, it was reported that Cambridge Analytica was shutting down its business. According to news from The Wall Street Journal, Founder of SCL Group Nigel Oakes, Cambridge Analytica’s British affiliate, told the paper that the two businesses were shutting down.",

The second installment will be published on Truthdig on Tuesday.\n\nInternal documents exclusively obtained by the Grayzone Project and embedded at the end of this article show how Cambridge Analytica’s UK-based parent company, SCL group, conducted a surveillance operation in Yemen, using psychological profiling, “strategic communications campaigns,” and infiltration of foreign operatives into indigenous communities through unwitting local partners whom they were instructed to deceive.\n\nThe SCL documents describe “a research and analysis study undertaken by Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) on behalf of Archimedes,” a US-based military contractor. The name of the operation was “Project Titania.” It relied heavily on deception to gain access to the local population, ordering project operatives to develop a “cover story” that placed their presence in the country in a more innocent light.\n\nThe geographic targets of the project were Yemen’s Hadramout and Marib provinces. These regions have served as organizational bases for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, and were at the time in the crosshairs of then-President Barack Obama’s drone assassination program.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of the methods of surveillance and manipulation revealed in these SCL documents closely mirror the tactics that were later applied in Western electoral contests. And when these tactics were exposed in early 2018, they ignited a political firestorm.\n\nThe data and behavioral analytics firm Cambridge Analytica closed shop this May following damaging revelations that it obtained the raw data of over 80 million Facebook users during the 2016 presidential election campaign, and exploited this information to influence the outcome of numerous political campaigns. The damage spread across the Atlantic, to Cambridge Analytica’s UK-based parent company, SCL group, forcing it to shutter its operations as well.\n\nCambridge Analytica was partially owned by Steve Bannon, the former manager of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and ex-White House chief of staff. It was co-owned by Bannon’s main financial angel at the time, reclusive right-wing tech billionaire Robert Mercer, and his daughter, Rebekah Mercer, who served as its vice president.\n\nCambridge Analytica debuted its work with a series of Republican Get Out the Vote efforts in 2014, deploying the psychological profiling techniques that have become the company’s bread and butter. “Its dirty little secret was that there was no one American involved in [the 2016 effort], that it was a de facto foreign agent, working on an American election,” former Cambridge Analytica research director Christopher Wylie revealed.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, Cambridge Analytica played a central role in Trump’s digital outreach efforts. In a hidden camera investigation by the UK’s Channel 4, Cambridge Analytica executives took credit for generating several enduring lines of attack against Hillary Clinton. “We just put information into the bloodstream of the internet and then watch it grow, give it a little push every now and again over time to watch it take shape,” one executive boasted. “And so this stuff infiltrates the online community, but with no branding, so it’s unattributable, untrackable.”\n\nSCL Group and ‘Project Titania’\n\nThe ethically dubious tactics that Cambridge Analytica rolled out during the 2016 campaign had been honed by its parent company, the London-based SCL Group, in an array of influence operations in conflict zones and Third World election contests.\n\nFounded in 2005, SCL specializes in what company literature has described as “influence operations” and “psychological warfare” around the globe. An SCL brochure leaked to the BBC revealed how the firm exacerbated ethnic tensions in Latvia to assist their client in 2006.\n\nA year later, the firm orchestrated “anti-election” rallies to suppress the opposition vote in Nigeria’s 2007 presidential election. Then, in 2010, according to the BBC, SCL initiated an “ambitious campaign of political graffiti” that “ostensibly came from the youth,” enabling its client to “claim credit for listening to a ‘united youth.’”\n\nSCL has also applied its influence in Ukraine, first as part of the broader public relations campaign during the country’s NATO-backed 2004 “Orange Revolution,” then in Ukraine’s contested Donbas region, where it boasted in company literature that it “succeeded in maintaining the cohesion of the coalition to ensure a hard fought victory.”\n\nBut SCL has also played an equally unsettling role as a private arm of British and US counter-insurgency efforts in the Middle East.\n\nInternal documents legally obtained by the Grayzone Project provide an exclusive look at one such effort overseen by SCL. The materials show how the company used psychological profiling, “strategic communications campaigns,” and foreign operatives, in methods of surveillance and manipulation that parallel the tactics that were subsequently used to influence Western elections.\n\nA media professional whom SCL attempted to recruit for an influence operation in Iran described to the Grayzone Project an array of covert campaigns across the region. Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the source said they were solicited in 2009 by a SCL staffer seeking a person to infiltrate Iran under journalistic cover and gather data on its population.\n\nThough the media professional rejected the job, expressing deep reservations about the company’s emphasis on subterfuge, they described similar operations they learned about that targeted populations in Libya, Pakistan, and Syria.\n\nThe source was told that the Syrian operation gathered human intelligence by using foreigners either posing as Arabic language students or enrolled in study abroad-style programs.\n\nSCL has acknowledged in company documents that it has operated in Libya, Syria and Iran.\n\nThe documents obtained by the Grayzone Project provide perhaps the first inside look at one of these programs. They shine light on the “research and analysis study” that SCL conducted in Yemen on behalf of the military contractor Archimedes, known as Project Titania.\n\n‘A Cover Story Will Be Used’\n\nWhen SCL launched Project Titania, US drones regularly shadowed the skies over the Yemeni regions of Marib and Hadramout. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had successfully turned both areas into training and recruitment grounds, as well as bases for attacks on government troops.\n\nIn May 2010, an American drone strike accidentally killed the deputy governor of Marib, provoking his tribe to attack the country’s main oil pipeline in revenge and drain its economy of $1 billion in revenue. A year later in Marib, a drone strike personally authorized by then-President Barack Obama killed AQAP propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki and his son, Abdurahman, who was a US citizen.\n\nProject Titania was defined by its authors as a counter-radicalization study aimed at reducing the appeal and influence of AQAP across Yemen. The operation first aimed to identify a “Non Desired Behavior” — defined as “support for, and engagement in, violent Jihadism” — and to explain the factors that accounted for its existence and growth. Next, the project called for a proposal for a “Strategic Communication Campaign” to undermine the spread of jihadist ideology.\n\nSCL instructed its field researchers to disseminate questionnaires to Yemeni locals in order to gather their psychological profiles. The goal spelled out in Project Titania’s mission plan was to gain a “detailed psychosocial understanding of the groups that can be used to most effectively influence” young Yemeni men deemed vulnerable to jihadist recruitment. These methods predated the use by Cambridge Analytica of Facebook questionnaires to gather personal data on American voters.\n\nThe foreigners dispatched to implement Project Titania were explicitly instructed to deceive the Yemeni citizens they would rely on for field research. “A cover story will be used to explain the purpose of the research to the researchers; the local researchers will not be informed of the objectives or sponsors of the study,” a SCL document states. “The questionnaire and interview protocol will be completely non-attributable to the original source.”\n\nSCL even proposed options for the cover story: “Prior to completing the interview or the questionnaire, all participants will be given a rationale for the study (i.e., that the study is part of a university research programme or a market research programme) and they will be informed that their responses will be kept confidential.”\n\nThe use of cover stories in Western intelligence operations has led to severe social damage in some cases. In Pakistan, locals had long suspected that the CIA was hunting for drone targets behind the smokescreen of a vaccination program run by Pakistani Polio Eradication Initiative. When news broke that the CIA had run a bogus hepatitis B eradication campaign in an unsuccessful bid to obtain the DNA of Osama bin Laden’s family, militant elements initiated a boycott of vaccination programs. Over 3 million children went without polio vaccines as a result, and the disease spread into neighboring countries.\n\nDid the UK Government Contract SCL in Yemen?\n\nThe leaked Project Titania documents highlight the British government’s participation in SCL’s covert activities in Yemen, and suggest that it was the client that had contracted the private counter-insurgency operation.\n\nA section labeled “risk register” contains the following security guideline for field operatives: “All foreign national team members to liaise with contact at British embassy and register with UK FCO LOCATE service.” (The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s LOCATE service provided expats with security issue updates; it was abolished in 2013 because so few citizens enrolled in it).\n\nProject Titania documents listed an array of NGOs operating in Marib and appeared to suggest them as potential vehicles for obtaining intelligence on the indigenous population. The names of those NGOs have been redacted from this report to protect staff from repercussions that might result from their connection to a covert Western influence operation. If any wound up as participants in Project Titania, they did so unwittingly, as project materials specifically demanded they be coerced into the operation under false pretenses.\n\nYasha Levine, a journalist and author of “Surveillance Valley: The Hidden History of the Internet,” saw SCL’s Project Titania as a fairly typical counter-insurgency operation. “Looking at these documents about SCL’s Yemen data-driven counterinsurgency program, the most remarkable thing about them is just how unremarkable it is,” Levine told the Grayzone Project.\n\n“If you change the wording a bit,” he continued, “SCL’s proposal could have been written a half century ago for the Vietnam War, where computer-aided counterinsurgency technologies were first pioneered. Back then the idea was that to fight insurgencies — wars in which enemy combatants came out of the general population — you first needed to understand the cultural, social and political environment in which the enemy operated. That meant first and foremost studying and surveilling restive populations as if they were lab rats, and then using advanced computer technology to shift through and process all the information coming in.”\n\n“Even back then, in the 1960s, the holy grail was to build computer technologies that could watch the world in real time and predict human behavior — stopping revolts and revolutions before they had a chance to develop,” Levine said. “The push to build these technologies is what the Internet came out of.”\n\nBut there was more to Project Titania than what was revealed in the SCL documents. Communications obtained by the Grayzone Project linked the project’s principal director to a much wider program of surveillance and data mining aimed not only at a region or two, but at the entire Arab world.\n\nStay tuned for part two of this investigation. The complete plan for Project Titania is below.\n\nSCL/Cambridge Analytica Project Titania Yemen Plan by Max Blumenthal on Scribd\n\nSCL/Cambridge Analytica Project Titania Plan for Yemen, Part Two by Max Blumenthalon Scribd\n\nTruthdig is running a reader-funded project to document the Poor People’s Campaign.

    "article_text": "Investors who backed a rebranding of Cambridge Analytica are in a stand-off with former chief executive Alexander Nix after he allegedly withdrew more than $8 million (€7.1 million ) from the scandal-hit data firm shortly before it collapsed.\n\nSeveral people involved in the dispute told the Financial Times the withdrawal came shortly after Mr Nix learned British media was reporting on allegations about his company’s role in a massive leak of Facebook user data in March. Mr Nix did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nAccording to these people, the investors are pressing Mr Nix to repay the money to Cambridge Analytica employees and investors.\n\nThey said Emerdata, a company set up last year to acquire and rebrand Cambridge Analytica and a related company, SCL Group, had raised $19 million from powerful international investors in January to expand the company’s services and bid for more commercial work.\n\nBills\n\nThe money ran out quickly, the people said, because of outstanding bills to advertisers and other suppliers, and because of the alleged withdrawal by Mr Nix. According to some of the people, Mr Nix has indicated that he intends to repay part of the money. One person added that Mr Nix said the withdrawal was made in exchange for unbooked services.\n\nBankruptcy filings in New York show that Cambridge Analytica received an $8.8 million loan from Emerdata before it entered administration, though it is not clear what the loan was intended for. Documents show the debt is classified as an unsecured “non-priority” loan that might not have to be returned.\n\nGovernments have access to vast quantities of data; on both their own citizens and foreign nationals. These data can be used to help governments identify, segment and target key audiences for campaigns of information or influence\n\nPrivate placing memorandum\n\nMr Nix, who was suspended from Cambridge Analytica before the company closed, will appear before British lawmakers on Wednesday to testify about his role in the company’s harvesting the information of tens of millions of Facebook users without consent.\n\nAccording to several insiders, most of the company’s employees have been dismissed without severance pay after Cambridge Analytica and a web of related entities were wound up over the past month. However, investors and employees have argued that staff should receive redundancy payments, they said.\n\nDocuments seen by the FT confirm that a holding company was established to acquire Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group, which had previously focused on defence and political work, including Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.\n\nThese documents and a private placing memorandum set out plans to raise about $30 million to pitch for more commercially-related work and develop a “high-volume core business” with off-the-shelf data-targeting products.\n\n“This pivot will address the scalability problems associated with the ‘data­science as a service business model’, where the growth of the company is constrained by a limited and highly­ competitive talent pool,” the memorandum said.\n\nData\n\nIt added: “Governments have access to vast quantities of data; on both their own citizens and foreign nationals. These data can be used to help governments identify, segment and target key audiences for campaigns of information or influence.”\n\nCambridge Analytica also formed a working group of senior ex-military personnel and government executives to identify products and services most relevant to government clients, according to the documents.\n\nCompany filings in the UK show Emerdata earlier this year issued nearly 2m shares and added several new directors to its board including Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer, the daughters of hedge fund billionaire and prominent Trump supporter Robert Mercer.\n\nOther new directors include 29-year-old Ahmad Al Khatib and Cheng Peng, a representative of Hong Kong-listed investment house Reorient Group.\n\nJohnson Ko, executive director of Reorient Group, was also added as a director of Emerdata in January. Mr Ko is a business partner of Erik Prince, another Trump associate and the founder of private mercenary group Blackwater, at the security firm Frontier Services Group.\n\nCambridge Analytica saw an exodus of clients following the revelations by UK media outlets The Observer and Channel 4 over its use of Facebook data in political campaigns and an undercover Channel 4 documentary that showed Mr Nix suggesting he could entrap the opponents of clients by offering bribes.\n\nPeople close to the company said Cambridge Analytica was faced with large legal bills and press relations fees after it attempted to defuse the crisis by launching a website intended to explain the “facts behind the Facebook” story.\n\nThe company now has assets of less than $500,000 and liabilities of $8.8 million, according to unaudited financial statements filed as part of the bankruptcy proceedings. Cambridge Analytica’s revenue dropped sharply from $25.3 million in 2016 to $5.2 million in 2017, the filings reveal. It also recorded a net operating loss of $13.5 million in 2017.\n\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2018",

    "article_text": "Cambridge Analytica’s parent company boasted that it had influenced voters across the world – including one claim that “anti-election rallies” had been held to discourage people from turning out at the ballot box in Nigeria.\n\nSCL Group documents submitted by whistleblower Christopher Wylie and released by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee on Thursday revealed the company speaking of its “international experience” in political research, citing work on multiple foreign elections.\n\nThe political consultancy used its analysis of Nigerian voters to “advise that rather than trying to motivate swing voters to vote for our clients, a more effective strategy might be to persuade opposition voters not to vote at all – an action that could be easily monitored”.\n\n“This was achieved by organising anti-election rallies on the day of polling in opposition strongholds,” the text said.\n\nSCL said that it had identified ahead of Latvian elections that “unspoken ethnic tensions between the indigenous Latvians and the Russian immigrant population” were “at the heart of the election”.\n\n“The locals secretly blamed the Russians for stealing their jobs, for the crime and for the other social problems vocally attributed to the economy,” the document said.\n\nA page from the SCL Group documents, submitted by Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie.\n\n“Armed with this knowledge, SCL was able to reflect these real issues in its client’s messaging,” it said.\n\nIn another example, SCL said that “covertly organised” rallies at universities in Indonesia were used as a method to help prevent civil war in the late 1990s.\n\n“Initially the government was nervous of large rallies, fearing that the strategy might encourage widespread disobedience. But the rallies were peacefully conducted and the students became confident that their message was being heard,” the case study said.\n\n“Almost immediately the civil unrest that had been escalating dissipated and no serious civil disobedience was reported throughout the election process which saw the induction of the Muslim cleric, Abdurrahman Wahid to the presidency.”\n\nThe document also features claims about its work on elections in Kenya, Colombia, Italy, Romania, Trinidad and Tobago and St Kitts and Nevis, as well as a series of polls in India.\n\nOn its website, SCL Group says it has “conducted behavioural change programmes in over 60 countries” over the course of more than 25 years.",

    "article_text": "Political consultancy, under fire over use of millions of Facebook users’ data, has begun insolvency proceedings\n\nCambridge Analytica, the data firm at the centre of this year’s Facebook privacy row, is closing and starting insolvency proceedings.\n\nThe company has been plagued by scandal since the Observer reported that the personal data of about 50 million Americans and at least a million Britons had been harvested from Facebook and improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica.\n\nCambridge Analytica denies any wrongdoing, but says that the negative media coverage has left it with no clients and mounting legal fees.\n\nPlay Video 3:41 What is the Cambridge Analytica scandal? - video explainer\n\n“Despite Cambridge Analytica’s unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully, the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the Company’s customers and suppliers,” said the company in a statement, which also revealed that SCL Elections Ltd, the UK entity affiliated with Cambridge Analytica, would also close and start insolvency proceedings.\n\n“As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business, which left Cambridge Analytica with no realistic alternative to placing the company into administration.”\n\nAs first reported by the Wall Street Journal, the company has started insolvency proceedings in the US and UK. At Cambridge Analytica’s New York offices on an upmarket block on Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue, it appeared all the staff had already left the premises.\n\nThe Guardian rang the doorbell to the company’s seventh-floor office and was met by a woman who would not give her name but said she did not work for the company.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Cambridge Analytica office in New York. Photograph: Oliver Laughland for the Guardian\n\nAsked if anyone from Cambridge Analytica or SCL was still inside, she said: “They used to be. But they all left today.”\n\nThe scandal centres around data collected from Facebook users via a personality app developed by the Cambridge University researcher Aleksandr Kogan. The data was collected via Facebook’s permissive “Graph API”, the interface through which third parties could interact with Facebook’s platform. This allowed Kogan to pull data about users and their friends, including likes, activities, check-ins, location, photos, religion, politics and relationship details. He passed the data to Cambridge Analytica, in breach of Facebook’s platform policies.\n\nChristopher Wylie, the original Cambridge Analytica whistleblower, told the Observer that the data Kogan obtained was used to influence the outcome of the US presidential election and Brexit. According to Wylie the data was fed into software that profiles voters and tries to target them with personalised political advertisements. Cambridge Analytica insists it never incorporated the Kogan data.\n\nRevealed: 50 million Facebook profiles harvested for Cambridge Analytica in major data breach Read more\n\nKogan told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was being used as a scapegoat.\n\nHe said: “My view is that I’m being basically used as a scapegoat by both Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Honestly, we thought we were acting perfectly appropriately. We thought we were doing something that was really normal.”\n\nCambridge Analytica said it had been “vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas”.\n\nThe CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, was suspended in late March after Britain’s Channel 4 News broadcast secret recordings in which he claimed credit for the election of Donald Trump.\n\nHe told an undercover reporter: “We did all the research, all the data, all the analytics, all the targeting. We ran all the digital campaign, the television campaign and our data informed all the strategy.”\n\nHe also revealed that the company used a self-destruct email server to erase its digital history.\n\n“No one knows we have it, and secondly we set our … emails with a self-destruct timer … So you send them and after they’ve been read, two hours later, they disappear. There’s no evidence, there’s no paper trail, there’s nothing.”\n\nAlthough Cambridge Analytica might be dead, the team behind it has already set up a mysterious new company called Emerdata. According to Companies House data, Alexander Nix is listed as a director along with other executives from SCL Group. The daughters of the billionaire Robert Mercer are also listed as directors.\n\nDamian Collins, chair of the British parliamentary committee looking into data breaches, expressed concern that Cambridge Analytica’s closure might hinder the investigation into the firm.\n\n“Cambridge Analytica and SCL group cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing. The investigations into their work are vital,” he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe episode has shone a spotlight on the way that Facebook data is collected, shared and used to target people with advertising.\n\nThe social network initially scrambled to blame rogue third parties for “platform abuse” – “the entire company is outraged we were deceived,” the company said – before it unveiled sweeping changes to its privacy settings and data sharing practices.\n\n“This was a breach of trust between Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Facebook,” said Mark Zuckerberg in a Facebook post. “But it was also a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it. We need to fix that.”\n\n\n\nCambridge Analytica: five key claims by academic at heart of scandal Read more\n\nFacebook first discovered that Kogan had shared data with Cambridge Analytica when a Guardian journalist contacted the company about it at the end of 2015. It asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and revoked Kogan’s apps’ API access. However, Facebook relied on Cambridge Analytica’s word that it had done so.\n\nAfter it was revealed that the data hadn’t been deleted, Facebook revoked Cambridge Analytica’s access to its platform and launched an investigation of “thousands” of apps that had similar access and made several changes to restrict how much third-party developers can access from people’s profiles.\n\nThe company also pledged to verify the identities of administrators of popular Facebook pages and advertisers buying political “issue” ads on “debated topics of national legislative importance” such as education, immigration and abortion.",

Try another or register with your social account\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica consultancy at the center of this year's Facebook privacy row has declared itself bankrupt and announced it is closing.\n\nNigel Oakes founder of SCL Group, the parent company to the consultancy firm confirmed it was closing on Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe newspaper added, citing an unnamed source, that the decision was taken because the companies were losing clients and facing mounting legal fees in the Facebook investigation.\n\nThe company, which worked on the Brexit campaign, sustained severe criticism after harvesting data from millions of Facebook profiles to target users with personalised adverts.\n\nThe move comes in the wake of rising legal costs in the Facebook investigation and the loss of clients following revelations about the firm in March.\n\nIn a statement on the firm's website, Clarence Mitchell, a spokesman for CA said:\n\n\"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas,\n\n\"Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers.\n\n\"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business.\"\n\nDamian Collins, chair of the Commons select committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) tweeted: \"Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group cannot be allowed to delete their data history by closing.\n\n\"The investigations into their work are vital.\"\n\nMary Creagh, Labour MP for Wakefield, tweeted: \"Outrageous. Insolvency used to cover up illegality\".\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Collins repeated a request for Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to appear before the committee, saying evidence provided by Facebook chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer last week \"failed to answer fully\" almost 40 questions.\n\nMr Zuckerberg has said it was a mistake to rely on CA to delete tens of millions of Facebook users' data and has apologised for the \"major breach of trust\".\n\nUp to 87 million people may have data harvested by an app which was then acquired by CA, according to Facebook.\n\nThe app, a personality survey called \"yourdigitallife\" built by Aleksander Kogan, of Cambridge University, collected personal data from users and their Facebook friends, in line with the behaviour of many similar apps at the time.\n\nIt allowed CA to tailor specific political adverts to small groups of people, already knowing what their likes and interests were, it is alleged.\n\nCA played a key role in mapping out the behaviour of voters in the run-up to the 2016 US election and was also used during the EU referendum campaign earlier that year.\n\nAs the scandal was unfolding, the company was also rocked by undercover recordings appearing to show senior figures in the company boasting about underhand tactics that could be used to entrap opposition politicians like bribery and sex.\n\nChief executive Alexander Nix was suspended in March following the broadcasting of the footage by Channel 4 News.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Information Commissioner's Office said: \"The ICO has been investigating the SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica as part of a wider investigation into the use of personal data and analytics by political campaigns, social media companies and others.\n\n\"We will be examining closely the details of the announcements of the winding down of Cambridge Analytica and the status of its parent company.\n\n\"The ICO will continue its civil and criminal investigations and will seek to pursue individuals and directors as appropriate and necessary even where companies may no longer be operating.\n\n\"We will also monitor closely any successor companies using our powers to audit and inspect, to ensure the public is safeguarded.\"",

Dr Tayler has since left the board of Emerdata but was appointed chief executive of Cambridge Analytica in Nix's place.\n\nCambridge Analytica is at the centre of a row over their use of Facebook data, accused of harvesting personal information from more than 50 million accounts and using it to target them with political advertising which plays on their hopes and fears.\n\n\"If you're collecting data on people and you're profiling them, that gives you more insight that you can use to know how to segment the population, to give them messaging about issues that they care about, and language and imagery that they're likely to engage with,\" Dr Tayler said about his work at CA, in footage secretly filmed by Channel 4 News.\n\n\"We used that in America and we used that in Africa. That's what we do as a company.\"\n\nAlso named as a director of Emerdata is 66-year-old Hong Kong businessman Johnson Chun Shun Ko, a close associate of Erik Prince, founder of private military contractor Blackwater, which secured hundreds of millions in government contracts for private military operations during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nMr Ko serves as deputy chairman for Frontier Services Group Limited, a company which describes itself as a \"Africa-focused security, aviation and logistics company\" and is led by Mr Prince, its chairman.\n\nMr Prince is the brother of Donald Trump's secretary of education Betsy DeVos, and is alleged to have met an ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin in the Seychelles in January 2017, nine days before the Mr Trump's inauguration. The Washington Post described the meeting as \"an apparent effort to establish a back-channel line of communication\" between Moscow and the then president-elect.\n\nMr Prince and the White House deny he was representing the Trump transition team in any way. Mr Prince described the meeting as a chance encounter that had nothing to do with the president.\n\nTwo other directors with apparent links to the UK were also listed.\n\nOne, 29-year-old Ahmad Al-Khatib, was described as a citizen of the Seychelles living in England, who joined the company at the same time as Mr Ko.\n\nThe other was a 30-year-old woman with British citizenship living in Hong Kong called Cheng Peng.\n\nLittle is known about either Mr Al-Khatib's or Ms Peng's role or background.\n\nMr Nix, Mr Ko, Mr Al-Khatib and Ms Peng were all appointed directors of the company on January 23 2018. Companies House records also show there was an allotment of shares to the value of almost £2 million on the same day.\n\nMr Wheatland and Dr Tayler ceased to be people \"with significant control\" on January 23, according to Companies House, although Mr Wheatland remains a director.\n\nThe company has been incorporated at two separate addresses: initially, at the offices of a law firm in central London and later an accountancy firm in Canary Wharf.",

    "article_text": "Conservative party donors are among the investors in the company that spawned the election consultancy at the centre of a storm about use of data from Facebook.\n\nFilings for SCL Group, which is at the top of a web of companies linked to Cambridge Analytica, show that since its conception in 2005 its shareholders and officers have included a wine millionaire who has given more than £700,000 to the party, a former Conservative MP, and a peer who was a business minister under David Cameron.\n\nOn Wednesday, Theresa May faced questions in the House of Commons over Tory links to the company. “As far as I’m aware the government has no current contracts with Cambridge Analytica or with the SCL Group,” the prime minister said.\n\nDowning Street said that Cambridge Analytica had approached the Conservatives about working for the party, but that the approach had happened “under a previous administration”, and the bid had been rejected.\n\n\n\n“An approach was made and the party decided not to take that forward,” May’s spokesperson said.\n\nLater a spokesperson acknowledged that the government had previously held three contracts with SCL Group but said that they had ended well before the current issues. Two of the contracts were undertaken under the last Labour government.\n\nCambridge Analytica hit the headlines at the weekend after it was revealed that data had been harvested for it from 50m Facebook profiles without the users’ permission. On Monday, undercover reporting by Channel 4 News showed the head of the firm, Alexander Nix, offering covert services to a man he thought was a prospective client.\n\n\n\nThe US firm is owned by the Mercer family and a UK company called SCL Elections, which is part of the SCL Group.\n\nUntil 2015, SCL Group was known as Strategic Communication Laboratories. It was only registered with UK Companies House in 2005, but was mentioned in articles in 2000 about the Indonesian elections.\n\nFrom its outset as a UK-registered company, SCL Group had investors from the upper echelons of British life. Lord Marland, a successful businessman who became a minister in 2010, held shares personally and through two related investment vehicles, Herriot Limited and a family trust.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Lord Marland. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian\n\nMarland said that he had not been involved in running the company, and had refused a request to introduce it to Conservative party HQ.\n\n“I have had very little engagement with the company and in fact am fairly sure I have only met Mr Nix once,” he said.\n\n“I also know very little of their operations as my initial investment was over 10 years ago. As such I had no idea of their Facebook data and am naturally concerned about current events.”\n\nSir Geoffrey Pattie, a former Conservative defence and industry minister, took a key role in the company for its first three years. In a Guardian article from 2005 he is described fronting the company’s stand – which is “more Orwell than 007” – at a defence show in London. Pattie is shown to have resigned as a director in 2008.\n\n\n\nOne of Marland’s fellow investors, and the person now registered as having “significant control” over SCL Group, is a Conservative party donor called Roger Gabb.\n\nGabb, who introduced the Volvic water brand to the UK then went on to make millions selling wines including the Kumala label, now owns more than 25% of the company. At its formation he was named as a shareholder, as was the Glendower Settlement Trust which is linked to him and his wife.\n\nGabb has given £707,000 to the Tories since 2004, making contributions to the main party and his local Ludlow branch. In 2006 he gave £500,000 to the party, making him one of its largest donors at the time.\n\nHe was also a campaigner for Brexit, signing letters on behalf of the campaign as a director of Bibendum Wine, and placing an advert in local newspapers. In October 2016 he was fined £1,000 by the Electoral Commission for failing to include his name and address in the advert.\n\nThe property tycoon Vincent Tchenguiz was also a shareholder via his company Consensus Business Group. Tchenguiz donated £21,500 to the Conservatives between 2009 and 2010.\n\nFor eight years from 2005 Consensus Business Group held just under a quarter of the shares in SCL, which was valued at around £4m at the time of the investment.\n\nThe firm said it had no role in the running of the company, and had sold off its stake in 2013. It appears that it received around £150,000 for the shares.\n\nIn a statement a Consensus Business Group spokesperson said the company was a minority financial investor in SCL and was never involved in the day-to-day management or its operations.\n\nFacebook scandal: I am being used as scapegoat – academic who mined data Read more\n\nThe spokesperson added: “Consensus Business Group invested in SCL in 2005 taking a 24% stake in the business, on the basis that the company developed a major emergency response and strategic communication centres capabilities for clients.\n\n“SCL was one of many investments made by Consensus Business Group between 2002 and 2008. Consensus Business Group lost interest and began negotiations for exit in 2013 and finally sold its stake back to SCL in Q1 2015.”\n\nJulian Wheatland, a close associate of Tchenguiz, was involved with SCL Group from the beginning, and is still a director at the company.\n\nThe other main players at SCL Group are Nigel Oakes, an old Etonian from a military family – his father is Maj John Waddington Oakes – and a former boyfriend of Lady Helen Windsor. Oakes had previously set up a company called Behavioural Dynamics which made many similar claims to SCL about its ability to influence voters. In 2000, it worked for the Indonesian president, reportedly without great success.\n\n\n\nNix, a fellow old Etonian, is reported to have joined Oakes at an earlier incarnation of SCL in 2003. Companies House data shows he is linked to 10 firms, which all appear to be linked in some way.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the Scottish National party’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, asked May about her party’s links with SCL, which he said “go on and on”.\n\n“Its founding chairman was a former Conservative MP. A director appears to have donated over £700,000 to the Tory party. A former Conservative party treasurer is a shareholder,” he said.\n\n“Will the prime minister confirm to the house her government’s connections to the company?”\n\nMay said the allegations around Cambridge Analytica were “very concerning”.",

    "article_text": "\n\n\n\nSuspending Cambridge Analytica and SCL Group from Facebook\n\nBy Paul Grewal, VP & Deputy General Counsel\n\nUpdate on March 17, 2018, 9:50 AM: The claim that this is a data breach is completely false. Aleksandr Kogan requested and gained access to information from users who chose to sign up to his app, and everyone involved gave their consent. People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked.\n\nOriginally published on March 16, 2018:\n\nWe are suspending Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL), including their political data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, from Facebook. Given the public prominence of this organization, we want to take a moment to explain how we came to this decision and why.\n\nWe Maintain Strict Standards and Policies\n\nProtecting people’s information is at the heart of everything we do, and we require the same from people who operate apps on Facebook. In 2015, we learned that a psychology professor at the University of Cambridge named Dr. Aleksandr Kogan lied to us and violated our Platform Policies by passing data from an app that was using Facebook Login to SCL/Cambridge Analytica, a firm that does political, government and military work around the globe. He also passed that data to Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Inc.\n\nLike all app developers, Kogan requested and gained access to information from people after they chose to download his app. His app, “thisisyourdigitallife,” offered a personality prediction, and billed itself on Facebook as “a research app used by psychologists.” Approximately 270,000 people downloaded the app. In so doing, they gave their consent for Kogan to access information such as the city they set on their profile, or content they had liked, as well as more limited information about friends who had their privacy settings set to allow it.\n\nAlthough Kogan gained access to this information in a legitimate way and through the proper channels that governed all developers on Facebook at that time, he did not subsequently abide by our rules. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, he violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in 2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan and Wylie all certified to us that they destroyed the data.\n\nBreaking the Rules Leads to Suspension\n\nSeveral days ago, we received reports that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments they made. We are suspending SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.\n\nWe are committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people’s information. We will take whatever steps are required to see that this happens. We will take legal action if necessary to hold them responsible and accountable for any unlawful behavior.\n\nHow Things Have Changed\n\nWe are constantly working to improve the safety and experience of everyone on Facebook. In the past five years, we have made significant improvements in our ability to detect and prevent violations by app developers. Now all apps requesting detailed user information go through our App Review process, which requires developers to justify the data they’re looking to collect and how they’re going to use it – before they’re allowed to even ask people for it.\n\nIn 2014, after hearing feedback from the Facebook community, we made an update to ensure that each person decides what information they want to share about themselves, including their friend list. This is just one of the many ways we give people the tools to control their experience. Before you decide to use an app, you can review the permissions the developer is requesting and choose which information to share. You can manage or revoke those permissions at any time.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we also do a variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our policies and a positive experience for users. These include steps such as random audits of existing apps along with the regular and proactive monitoring of the fastest growing apps.\n\nWe enforce our policies in a variety of ways — from working with developers to fix the problem, to suspending developers from our platform, to pursuing litigation.",

    "article_text": "× Expand Lawrence Jackson President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama with Raila Amolo Odinga, then Prime Minister of Kenya, and his wife Mrs. Ida Odinga, New York, 2009.\n\nPolitical firm Cambridge Analytica attempted to suppress voting in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, whistleblower Christopher Wylie told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on May 16.\n\nWylie, a former contractor who disclosed the company’s alleged misuse of private Facebook user data earlier this year, said it targeted African American voters in particular, waging “cultural warfare” for political ends.\n\nThis was no surprise for many of us in nations where Cambridge Analytica’s parent company, SCL Group, has long been a silent player, including in my home country of Kenya.\n\nSCL Group is open about having “conducted behavioral change programs in over 60 countries,” describing itself as a service that provides data, analytics, and strategy to “governments and military organizations worldwide.” The firm has been involved in more than 200 elections across the globe, often through shadowy subsidiaries like Cambridge Analytica, in a wide range of countries including Australia, Italy, Britain, Czech Republic, Ukraine, Brazil, India, Malaysia, and Mexico.\n\nFrom almost its very beginnings, SCL Group used African politics as a testing ground for influencing the behavior of the voting public.\n\nIn South Africa in 1994, Nelson Mandela was running for president with the African National Congress. With apartheid hanging in the balance, unresolved tensions between the Zulu community, the nation’s largest ethnic group, and the ANC resulted in often-violent clashes. SCL Group claims they were invited to curb the escalating tensions, though it remains unclear who hired it and exactly what role it played.\n\nAfter September 11, 2001, SCL Group rebranded itself as a data company that could help major players navigate a brave new world through “psychological warfare” and “influence operations.” The firm worked strategically on elections to influence independent, undecided, and dormant voters to benefit their client running for office.\n\nIt’s in this capacity that SCL went to work in Nigeria’s 2007 and 2015 elections, which the country is now investigating. In 2007, SCL Group subsidiary SCL Elections allegedly “organised anti-election rallies to dissuade opposition supporters from voting” and in 2015, reportedly used Israeli hackers to access current President Muhammadu Buhari’s personal emails to benefit billionaire former President Goodluck Jonathan’s bid for reelection.\n\nBut it is SCL Group’s involvement in the Kenyan elections of 2013 and 2017 that are especially chilling in light of the recent news about meddling in the U.S. election.\n\nAs I’ve reported elsewhere, Kenya has received billions of dollars in funding since 2012 (with planned disbursements through 2022) from the United States, United Kingdom, and the European Union to fight a holdover proxy war in Somalia under the banner of a “war on terror.” This proxy war began with U.S. backing in 2006 against Islamic Courts Union. From there it escalated, with its militant wing Al Shabab emerging victorious after the Union was defeated.\n\nFollowing the involvement of the Kenyan military in October 2011, there have been unprecedented terror attacks within Kenya including the Westgate mall terror attack, increased xenophobia towards innocent Kenyan nationals of Somali descent, and rampant graft of military aid in both Somalia and Kenya. Incidentally, since the Kenyan arm of the proxy war began, Western companies have “discovered” oil in both Somalia and Northern Kenya.\n\nInto this environment of African political greed and Western opportunism walks SCL Group.\n\nKenya’s current President Uhuru Kenyatta, worth $500 million, made his first successful bid for the presidency in 2013, when he won against opposition leader Raila Odinga.\n\nOdinga had previously served as Prime Minister following a devastating 2007 presidential election where widespread violence erupted after incumbent Mwai Kibaki was abruptly declared winner—contradicting a televised tally process that appeared to favor Odinga. In fact, former U.S. Ambassador to Kenya Johnnie Carson recently said on an episode of Pod Save the World, “Although it is highly disputed, I believe in that 2007 election that Raila Odinga actually won.”\n\nIn a power-sharing agreement brokered by former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Kibaki was named president, Odinga Prime Minister and Uhuru Kenyatta Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nCome 2013, Odinga found himself up against Kenyatta, who was understood at the time to employ an opaque British firm to run his glitzy Jubilee Alliance campaign (rebranded in 2016 as Jubilee Party).\n\nAccording to a damning exposé by the United Kingdom’s Channel 4, Mark Turnbull, then the managing director of Cambridge Analytica Political Global, affirmed the company “ran” Kenyatta's campaigns in 2013 and 2017 from soup to nuts. In the Channel 4 video Turnbull states, “we have rebranded the entire party twice, written the manifesto, done research, analysis, messaging. I think we wrote all the speeches and we staged the whole thing—so just about every element of this candidate.”\n\nAfter Kenya’s polarizing 2007 elections, Uhuru Kenyatta and five others, most tied to Jubilee, were charged by the International Criminal Court for inciting violence, promoting hate speech, rape and hate crimes. Charges were dropped in December 2014 after dozens of witnesses recanted or disappeared and the government refused to cooperate. In this climate, Ugandan political scientist Mahmood Mamdani dubbed 2013 the “ICC Election” because an embattled demagogue emerged victorious against a modulating force of law and order.\n\nFollowing both the 2013 and 2017 elections, Odinga went to Kenya’s Supreme Court claiming election fraud. His 2013 case was dismissed for insufficient evidence, but in 2017, to everyone’s surprise, he won—without support from the Western nations which had declared the original results free and fair. For the first time in African history, a presidential election result was overturned for “irregularities” and “illegalities.”\n\nUnrest and intimidation surrounding Kenya’s fraudulent August 2017 election ended in dozens of deaths (many facilitated by the state). This included the murder of Chris Msando, national manager of the computerized voting system, slain just a week before the election.\n\nAnticipating a flawed outcome, Odinga called for an election boycott and only 48 percent of Kenyans turned out to vote in the court mandated rerun of October 2017 (over 79 percent had participated in the original August election). Predictably, Kenyatta won in a cartoonish victory with 98.25 percent of the vote.\n\nThe current mood is Kenya is not unlike that in the United States after Donald Trump’s election victory—including a frustrated resistance movement.\n\nMany citizens feel cheated, having had just four presidents serve the nation in fifty-five years of independence. The heartbreak in 2017, with its brutal violence and the stunted almost-election of Raila Odinga, was a another missed opportunity for genuine change. Knowledge of Cambridge Analytica’s role in the corruption of the electoral process only exacerbates a naked cynicism about modern nation-building that is deeply tragic.\n\nAnd there’s no sign that such activity will disappear. Following the scandal unleashed by whistleblower Wylie, SCL Group—and its subsidiaries, including Cambridge Analytica—“officially” closed shop. But it remains largely intact in the form of a brand-new firm Emerdata, boasting many of the same executives of SCL Group, and the same data mining mission.\n\nAs Americans grapple with interference in their own elections, Kenyans are moving forward from stolen political victories and violence stoked by a private Western entity pushing the financial expediency of rightwing populism over democratic freedom.\n\nAgunda Okeyo is a writer, producer, organizer, and activist who writes from a global perspective about race, gender, politics, culture, books, film, and comedy.

Alastair Grant/The Canadian Press\n\nThe Canadian whistle-blower at the centre of the Cambridge Analytica scandal says social media giants like Facebook, Google and Twitter should be forced to disclose all details related to political advertising.\n\nChristopher Wylie told MPs on Tuesday that this “simple solution” would go a long way toward addressing nefarious uses of social media in politics such as targeted ads.\n\n“The problem with targeting is that rather than standing in [a] public forum, you are going to each individual voter and whispering something in their ear,” he said. “In many cases, what you’re whispering is something you’d be happy to say in that public forum, and in some cases it may not be.”\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Wylie provided sworn testimony to the House of Commons Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics on Tuesday by video link from London. The committee is studying how Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that is part of the SCL Group of companies based in the U.K., improperly obtained the personal data of 87 million Facebook users.\n\nMr. Wylie launched an international controversy this year over Facebook’s approach to data privacy after he revealed that a personality app was used in an unauthorized way to harvest information on millions of Facebook users for political campaign targeting.\n\nThe data specialist explained that while any advertiser can easily aim Facebook ads at particular demographics, an advertiser with a database of specific individuals can bring it to Facebook and buy ads targeted directly at them. Facebook calls this “custom audiences” advertising.\n\nMr. Wylie was raised in British Columbia and worked briefly on Parliament Hill for federal Liberal politicians when the party was in opposition. He then moved to Britain, and joined SCL Group in 2013. He told MPs he encouraged his Victoria-based contacts Zack Massingham and Jeff Sylvester to work for SCL, which they did indirectly through contracts after forming a company called AggregateIQ.\n\nThe Victoria-based firm received large contracts from groups involved in Vote Leave during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign.\n\nBritish investigators are looking into whether the advertising contracts to AIQ were designed to get around campaign-expense laws.\n\nIn a May 14 letter to the U.K. Electoral Commission, Facebook provided details on ad purchases by Vote Leave and another pro-Brexit group, BeLeave.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFacebook said AIQ placed about US$2-million worth of custom audience ads on behalf of Vote Leave and BeLeave using a database named “50million_remains.”\n\nLast month, Mr. Massingham and Mr. Sylvester told Canadian MPs they did nothing wrong and simply helped the Vote Leave campaign place ads on Facebook.\n\nMr. Wylie challenged AIQ’s defence, noting that simply placing ads on Facebook to target demographics, rather than specific individuals, could be done by an intern.\n\n“To me, that’s just farcical as an explanation,” Mr. Wylie said. “Frankly, I’m surprised and really disappointed that Jeff Sylvester and Zack Massingham have decided to try to obfuscate or hide what happened. ... They had every opportunity to participate in blowing the whistle and they decided not to.”\n\nConservative MP Peter Kent used most of his time on Tuesday to ask Mr. Wylie about his connections to the federal Liberals and whether he ever targeted Canadian voters based on psychological traits. Mr. Wylie said a $100,000 contract he received from the Liberal Research Bureau in 2016 – shortly after the party formed government – was to help the bureau set up systems to track feedback from constituents, including on platforms like Twitter.\n\n“I did not work on a project related to psychographic targeting for the Liberal Party and that’s the end of it,” he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement",

    "article_text": "8 Min read time Share:\n\nImage: Book Catalog\n\nWere data crimes perpetrated against U.S. voters? We are about to know a lot more.\n\nLast March I was sitting at the kitchen table, enjoying my morning coffee, when an email from data.compliance@sclgroup.cc arrived. Two months earlier, I had requested my data from the Trump campaign’s data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, and the subject line of this new email (“Next steps in your request”) seemed promising. Cambridge Analytica, a part of the British company SCL Group, had boasted about collecting upward of 4,000 personal data points on people, including 240 million Americans, and as a researcher of the advertising industry’s use of data and technology, I had requested my own data profile out of academic curiosity.\n\nEven as it dissolves, Cambridge Analytica epitomizes a distressing new era of digital colonialism. The next dark data machines are already being built for the next elections.\n\nThe plan was not to take down the whole company. But when that email and its attachments failed to provide more than a cursory, generic profile lacking specific details on how they created it, I filed an official complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office, the United Kingdom’s data regulator, on July 4, 2017. As a U.S. citizen, there was very little I could do under U.S. law, but the legal challenge in British court that followed my ICO complaint centered on Cambridge Analytica’s compliance with the UK Data Protection Act of 1998. Both my complaint and separate legal claim challenge whether or not the company has been providing full disclosure as required by British law. They also seek to assert the right to be protected from this particular abuse of personal data in the future.\n\nCambridge Analytica has argued that because I am a U.S. citizen, I am no more entitled to UK data protection rights “than a member of the Taliban sitting in a cave in the remotest corner of Afghanistan.” But, thankfully, nearly a year after my formal complaint, the ICO disagreed, saying that because my data was processed in the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Act of 1998 applies.\n\nNot only is commercial foreign election interference anathema to democratic institutions, but consultancies such as SCL serve as bait for hostile state actors.\n\nIn an unprecedented and necessary flex of its muscle, the ICO served an Enforcement Notice against the executives that lurk behind the façade of Cambridge Analytica. They were told to provide all the information and details of my profile, including where they got the data and what they did with it. SCL was given thirty days (until June 4) to comply, appeal, or face criminal sanctions.\n\nOne would assume that Julian Wheatland, SCL’s new CEO, does not want criminal penalties over a stubborn refusal to give me my complete voter profile, but this company has, from the beginning, shown a remarkable disdain for its regulator (the ICO) and a stunning refusal to fully cooperate with its watchdog and lawmakers. That it has come to a criminal warrant and the risk of criminal charges illustrates the absurdity. Unless, of course, they are hiding something.\n\n• • •\n\nCambridge Analytica’s servers were seized under criminal warrant back in March, and the company filed for bankruptcy not long after it was revealed that it improperly exploited the data of 87 million Facebook users beginning in 2014, likely in contravention of UK data protection law, pending a report by the Information Commissioner. The ensuing media firestorm—to say nothing of the escalating legal fees—decimated the firm’s reputation.\n\nBut this big data debacle was, in my opinion, just the start of a seismic shift. As a privacy nerd, I warily cultivated a Facebook presence for myself but kept my settings on lockdown. According to Facebook’s own notification tool, I was not among the 87 million victims of the original data leakage. However, we can assume that Cambridge Analytica used data from many companies to compile its voter profiles, including data brokers such as Experian and Acxiom, media ratings agencies such as ComScore and Nielsen, and Oracle’s data management platforms for advertising tech.\n\nBy June 4, we should have a much fuller picture as to which of these other companies provided data that was matched to our voter registrations, without our knowledge, beyond our reach, and across international borders. Even as Cambridge Analytica rushes to liquidate and close up shop, the ICO has made it clear that Cambridge Analytica must still release my data, and if it does not, the executives could face criminal charges. Their business model was based on the premise that they could amass data on voters from countries with weak privacy laws, such as the United States, but it turns out they were operating based on a crucial misunderstanding of British privacy law.\n\nThere is still a lot we do not know about Cambridge Analytica’s involvement in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nGetting to this point has taken more than a year of time and effort. It has involved crowdsourcing a legal defense fund, weaving together many nested Twitter threads, and putting myself and my family at some considerable risk. All to test a privacy law in another country. But I am hopeful that when I win, everyone wins. We all have the right to know how firms connected to Cambridge Analytica got hold of our data, how they processed it, and who could have accessed it. This is how we can repatriate our voter files, something none of us ever imagined would become a necessity.\n\nMoreover, my case serves as a test case in this strange new realm of internationalized (and possibly militarized) election management, voter data technology, and political consulting firms who apparently employ tactics inspired by state intelligence agencies. For those of us whose democracies have been monetized by SCL Group and its affiliates, we may soon be able to reassert some control over our personal data before it is liquidated to the highest bidder.\n\nAnd not a moment too soon. Even as it dissolves, SCL Group epitomizes a distressing new era of digital colonialism. The next dark data machines are already being built for the next elections. Americans and citizens from other nations affected by SCL are finally beginning to appreciate why we all need data rights such as those afforded to citizens of the United Kingdom and European Union.\n\n• • •\n\nBut regulations such as the UK’s Data Protection Act and the EU’s newly enforceable General Data Protection Regulation can only do so much. Indeed, the Cambridge Analytica story resonates for many because it epitomizes the worst-case scenario. Cambridge Analytica enjoyed notoriety for its self-proclaimed psychological methods, but it is not likely to be a historic company in the long-run because of its invasive psychographics. More likely, this scandal illustrates how data crimes can undermine democracies around the world.\n\nThe scandal illustrates how data crimes can undermine democracies around the world.\n\nThere is still a lot we do not know about Cambridge Analytica’s involvement in the 2016 presidential election, but the Justice Department and the FBI are now reported to be investigating the company, along with several state attorneys general. Amidst a narrative of corruption and intrigue, Cambridge Analytica serves as a needed focal point in a transnational escapade spanning the United States, the UK, Canada, Kenya, Nigeria, India, and far beyond.\n\nWhen this saga concludes, we will better understand how and why the Mercers, the family of influential conservative donors whose patriarch founded Cambridge Analytica, allegedly funded the importing of illicit data science talent and software development from abroad. (I am guessing that expert data scientists willing to work on invasive and dubious Republican campaigns are a rare breed.) And we may also better understand Russia’s interference.\n\nWe know, based on testimony by whistleblower Christopher Wylie to Senate Judiciary and Parliament select committees, that the disgraced Alexander Nix pitched Lukoil’s CEO, Vagit Alekperov (who, like all oligarchs, is allegedly tight with Vladimir Putin), with a sensitive white paper on SCL’s voter data assets. Wylie also surmised that the Soviet-born, U.S. academic at the center of the Facebook data misappropriation scandal, Dr. Aleksander Kogan, could have easily been infiltrated and key-logged by Russian intelligence services during his travels back and forth between St. Petersburg University and Cambridge University in 2014. Wylie has also emphasized on multiple occasions that SCL Group was a prime target for hostile espionage based on its political clientele and its work in the Baltics for NATO.\n\nEven beyond its very flawed business model, this company should never have existed. Not only is commercial foreign election interference anathema to democratic institutions, but dodgy consultancies such as SCL serve as bait for hostile state actors—actors who are keen to amass personal data and weaponize it for information operations that sow chaos, divide an electorate against itself, and undermine confidence in democratic elections everywhere.\n\nWe need to unravel the tangled web of money and data laundering to show how ordinary citizens can support election integrity in the information age.\n\nThe election interference data crimes of 2016 may not even be limited to potentially treasonous conspiracies with Russian oligarchs and clandestine agents. Just this week, Bloomberg reported on a previously unknown information operations shop, PSY Group, which had links to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and was led by a former commander of an Israeli psychological warfare unit. PSY Group “formed an alliance with Cambridge Analytica” after Trump’s election “to try to win U.S. government work” by presumably offering services that include “infiltrating target audiences with elaborately crafted social-media personas and spreading misleading information through websites meant to mimic news portals.”\n\nCambridge Analytica may be dead, but this story is not yet over. I hope we manage to unravel this tangled web of money and data laundering to show how ordinary citizens can support election integrity in the information age. Our democracy and sovereignty—both personal and national—depend on it.",

    "article_text": "By Kathryn Jezer-Morton\n\nLately, I can’t log onto Facebook without being asked to consider my own motivations for using the site.\n\nAs a researcher who focuses on online communities, I’m accustomed to this running meta-narrative about what it is I’m actually doing online — but usually, that narrative plays inside my head, not all the way down the feed I’m scrolling through. It’s like my research questions have sprung to life these days: What’s Facebook all about, anyway? Is this even fun? If it’s not fun … what is it, exactly?\n\nThis is an exciting time in the very short history of social media use.\n\nFacebook’s users are becoming critical of the systems into which they’ve been conscripted. This is an important moment: Will public opinion follow the same well-worn cycle of outrage and acceptance, or will it jump the tracks and begin engaging Facebook on new, more challenging terms?\n\nResearchers have been asking tough questions about Facebook for the past decade, but even armed with the most prestigious credentials, they pose a much smaller threat than educated consumers. And without consumer outrage, government regulation seems unlikely to move forward.\n\n‘Sound and fury’\n\nSo far, at least in my own feed, the same old script is being followed to the letter. The soul-searching is punctuated by passionate cris-de-coeur from the feed’s more opinionated characters: Wake up, sheeple! If you’re not paying for the product, you are the product — remember? Quit Facebook! Encrypt your data! Smash your phone under the heel of your steel-toed boots!\n\nNext, right on cue, the incisive social commentators swoop in to remind us that these calls are coming from inside the house. “Pretty ironic that you’re posting all this stuff on Facebook!” To which everyone silently rolls their eyes in resignation. Cue the gallows humor about how we’re all under constant surveillance, rinse and repeat. The human condition’s same old two-step. Sound and fury, signifying nothing.\n\nThat this discursive cycle was triggered by the revelations earlier this year that voter profiling company Cambridge Analytica obtained the Facebook data of 50 million American accounts is beside the point.\n\nThis is only the latest in a long series of such leaks about data mining. In 2017, approximately 200 million registered voters’ personal data stored by voter profiling company Deep Root Analytics was accidentally made public. The previous year, Russian hackers accessed a large cache of voter information owned by the Democratic National Committee.\n\n(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWhat this latest go-round is revealing is that these are industry practices that will carry on undisturbed, regardless of what Mark Zuckerberg says or does. This is not a Zuckerberg problem anymore; it’s a problem with an advertising model that is the industry standard.\n\nMost of us Facebook users have been on the platform for about a decade, and perhaps our outrage is our growing pains.\n\nWe’ve gained some critical distance through time spent on the platform. We are less easily distracted by the ostensible fun the platform offers. And we appear to be compelled to ask questions about Facebook we’ve never asked before.\n\nMust ask different questions\n\nFenwick McKelvey, co-director of the Media History Research Centre at Concordia University’s Milieux Institute for Art, Culture, and Technology, wishes that the media would start asking different questions about how data is being used by platforms like Facebook.\n\n“The media narrative still assumes that the goal of these platforms (like Facebook) is to expose people to information,” McKelvey told me. “But it’s less and less about that — the goal is to manage and control people’s behavior.”\n\nAmong the urgent questions media commentators should be asking, McKelvey believes, is how online advertisers are deploying user data to subtly nudge people. He provides the illustrative example of SnapChat — a company with relatively strong privacy settings in place — that leaks data to advertisers with a dizzying granularity that reflects the industry standard.\n\nThrough SnapChat’s protocols, your phone informs advertisers how much time passes between the moment you’re served one of their ads and the moment you make a purchase at their business, either online or in person.\n\nEvery time you walk into a retailer with your phone’s location services on, you are leaking data about your consumption habits.\n\nPerhaps we should be burrowing even deeper into Facebook’s business practices.\n\nFacebook tends to rely on the fact that most of its data collection practices are laid bare in its terms of service. But according to Martin French, an assistant professor of sociology at Concordia, Facebook’s notion of “consent” is flimsy at best.\n\nMost unaware of how their data is being used\n\n“Facebook reportedly changed its policies after 2015 to stop app developers accessing information on app users’ network. But for me, the question is: Are Facebook users, in the real world, actually aware of the changing ways their data is being used, and the policies that purportedly govern these uses?” wonders French.\n\nFrench posits that based on research that has been done on who reads and understands social media privacy policies, most users are unaware of how their data is actually being used. The “consent” that Facebook is talking about when they refer to an agreement with their users is not really a kind of consent that conforms to any dictionary definition of that term.\n\nThe consensus among social scientists who study life online is that whatever dynamics play out online have offline analogs.\n\nWe’ve had a decade to incorporate Facebook into our lives, and like any learning process, our success with it has been uneven.\n\nWe’re at a critical moment as users of Facebook. It’s our responsibility to educate ourselves about the implications of our participation. Deactivating our accounts won’t change how our personal data is valued to advertisers.\n\nBut perhaps, as we become mature users of social media, we can begin to demand that limits be set on how and when our data is bought and sold.\n\nThe article was originally published in The Conversation.\n\nKathryn Jezer-Morton is a Ph.D. student in Sociology at Concordia University and head of communications at the Milieux Institute for Art, Culture and Technology at Concordia.",

    "article_text": "​Bad news if you're a participant in democracy: The personal information of potentially every single registered American voter was exposed by an extremely careless Republican data firm. The breach was discovered by an analyst working for the cyber resilience firm UpGuard, who found voters' \"names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, and voter registration details, as well as data described as 'modeled' voter ethnicities and religions\" on a publicly accessible Amazon server.\n\n\n\nThe server belonged to a Republican data firm called Deep Root Analytics, which contracted with the Republican National Committee to work for Donald Trump's campaign. UpGuard first stumbled across it a week ago.\n\nIn the early evening of June 12th, UpGuard Cyber Risk Analyst Chris Vickery discovered an open cloud repository while searching for misconfigured data sources on behalf of the Cyber Risk Team, a research unit of UpGuard devoted to finding, securing, and raising public awareness of such exposures. The data repository, an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket, lacked any protection against access. As such, anyone with an internet connection could have accessed the Republican data operation used to power Donald Trump’s presidential victory, simply by navigating to a six-character Amazon subdomain: \"dra-dw\".\n\n\n\n[UpGuard]\n\n\n\n\n\nAlex Lundry, a co-founder of Deep Root Analytics, told Gizmodo that the \"data was exposed after the company updated its security settings on June 1.\" Vickery says the server was secured shortly after he reported the unsecured server to federal authorities on June 14, which means that the data was publicly available for a period of 14 days.\n\nLundry told ZDNet that the firm takes \"full responsibility\" for the exposed data but also emphasized that a portion of the data was \"publicly available.\"\n\n\"Deep Root Analytics has become aware that a number of files within our online storage system were accessed without our knowledge,\" said Lundry.\n\n\"The data that was accessed was, to the best of our knowledge proprietary information as well as voter data that is publicly available and readily provided by state government offices. Since this event has come to our attention, we have updated the access settings and put protocols in place to prevent further access.\n\n\"We accept full responsibility, will continue with our investigation, and based on the information we have gathered thus far, we do not believe that our systems have been hacked,\" he said.\n\n[ZDNet]\n\n\n\n\n\nGizmodo points out that even publicly available information can be used for nefarious purposes.\n\nEven though voter rolls are public record and are easy to access — Ohio, for instance, makes its voter rolls available to download online — their exposure can still be harmful.\n\nVoter registration records include ZIP codes, birthdates, and other personal information that have been crucial in research efforts to re-identify anonymous medical data. Latanya Sweeney, a professor of government and technology at Harvard University, famously used voter data to re-identify Massachusetts Governor William Weld from information in anonymous hospital discharge records.\n\n[Gizmodo]\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat's more, the \"proprietary information\" in the breach includes predictions about what voters believe about particular issues, and Deep Root Analytics may even have attempted to match Reddit users to their voter registration records.\n\n[T]he records include advanced sentiment analyses used by political groups to predict where individual voters fall on hot-button issues such as gun ownership, stem cell research, and the right to abortion, as well as suspected religious affiliation and ethnicity. The data was amassed from a variety of sources—from the banned subreddit r/fatpeoplehate to American Crossroads, the super PAC co-founded by former White House strategist Karl Rove.\n\n\n\n[Gizmodo]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe breach isn't the first time data about American voters has been exposed, but it is the biggest known voter-related breach, affecting 61% of the entire US population.\n\nThe Deep Root incident represents the largest known leak of Americans' voter records, outstripping past exposures by several million records. Five voter-file leaks over the past 18 months exposed between 350,000 and 191 million files, some of which paired voter data—name, race, gender, birthdate, address, phone number, party affiliation, etc.—with email accounts, social media profiles, and records of gun ownership.\n\n\n\n[Gizmodo]",

Through his responsible disclosure, the server was secured late last week, and prior to publication.\n\nThis leak shines a spotlight on the Republicans' multi-million dollar effort to better target potential voters by utilizing big data. The move largely a response to the successes of the Barack Obama campaign in 2008, thought to have been the first data-driven campaign.\n\nThrough a handful of companies, including data firms, market researchers, and analytics providers, the GOP replicated that Obama campaign strategy by helping its political candidates make data-based decisions about their campaigns.\n\nThe exposed records include files provided by Data Trust, a data warehouse created by the GOP to serve as its exclusive data provider of voter records. The company sells and supplies voter data to political candidates, who rely on access to the data in order to shape their campaigns.\n\nAccording to UpGuard, the folder includes dozens of spreadsheets containing a unique GOP identifier for each voter for the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, which link to \"dozens of sensitive and personally identifying data points, making it possible to piece together a striking amount of detail on individual Americans specified by name.\" A folder containing 2016 data only included files for Ohio and Florida, two crucial battleground states.\n\nEach record lists a voter's name, date of birth, home address, phone number, and voter registration details, such as which political party a person is registered with. The data also includes \"profiling\" information, voter ethnicities and religions, and various other kinds of information pertinent to a voter's political persuasions and preferences, as modeled by the firms' data scientists, in order to better target political advertising.\n\nSenior executives at Data Trust would not speak on the record prior to publication.\n\nThe exposed server was also found to contain gigabytes of data from TargetPoint, a conservative market research firm focused on helping candidates better understand voters' policy preferences and political actions. Some of these files, says UpGuard, contain millions of entries that appear to rate voters on the post-election likelihood of supporting a certain policy, candidate, or belief on a scale of \"very unlikely\" to \"very likely.\"\n\nAn email to TargetPoint prior to publication went unanswered. (If we hear back, we will update.)\n\nDeep Root, which claims to be the \"most experienced group of targeters in Republican politics,\" uses that wealth of data to help its political clients make better decisions when buying television advertising air-time.\n\nThat, the hope is, allows prospective Republican candidates and their committees to target pro-trade Republicans who might vote blue, and Democrats who want tighter immigration controls who can be convinced to vote red.\n\nAlex Lundry, co-founder of Deep Root, confirmed the company owned the Amazon S3 storage server, and said in an email that company has taken \"full responsibility for this situation.\"\n\n\"Deep Root Analytics has become aware that a number of files within our online storage system were accessed without our knowledge,\" said Lundry.\n\n\"The data that was accessed was, to the best of our knowledge proprietary information as well as voter data that is publicly available and readily provided by state government offices.

    "article_text": "25% of Businesses Targeted with Cryptojacking in the Cloud\n\nNew public cloud security report detects a spike in cryptojacking, mismanaged cloud storage, account takeover, and major patches getting overlooked.\n\nIt seems like only yesterday we learned about the first of many Amazon S3 bucket leaks to expose troves of personal information in 2017. Poor cloud configuration was only one security issue to plague businesses last year; now, they have several to worry about.\n\nRedLock's second annual Cloud Security Trends report digs into lessons learned from attacks and breaches over the past year. Researchers found the top issues in the cloud are account compromises, which affected 27% of organizations, cryptojacking (25%), risky configurations (51%), and missing high-severity patches in the cloud (24%).\n\n\"Twelve months ago, in everyone's minds, the biggest thing was cloud misconfigurations, S3 buckets,\" says RedLock cofounder and CEO Varun Badhwar. By now, the threats have escalated.\n\nOn average, 27% of organizations experienced potential account compromise, including major companies Uber, Tesla, OneLogin, Aviva, and Gemalto. Risky configurations affected 51%; among them were FedEx, Deep Root Analytics, and Under Armour. Nearly one-quarter (24%), including Drupal, MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Intel, missed high-severity patches in the cloud.\n\nCryptojacking has gone mainstream as attackers have unprecedented access to high-powered public cloud computing resources, affecting major corporations like Tesla, Gemalto, and Aviva. One-quarter of organizations had cryptojacking in their environments, compared with just 8% last year. Badhwar says activity has ramped up 300% in the last quarter, partially because the bar to enter the world of cryptomining is low and the payoff is high.\n\n\"Once the attackers are in, the ease of the cloud is really what makes it possible,\" he notes. \"They can spin up an infinite number of resources … it's really a question of how aggressive they want to be.\" For some organizations, cryptomining incidents can cost between $50-100K per day, for every day an attacker is mining digital currency undetected on their network.\n\nResearchers also noticed account compromise has led to new attack vectors. Leaked credentials have been found in GitHub repositories, unsecured Kubernetes administrative interfaces, and public Trello boards; now, public cloud instance metadata APIs are an attack vector.\n\n\"Public cloud instance metadata is data about your instance that can be used toconfigure or manage the running instance,\" researchers report. \"Essentially, an instance's metadata can be queried via an API to obtain access credentials to the public cloud environment by any process running on the instance.\" Account compromise will continue to evolve, they anticipate.\n\nThere was a spot of good news in the report, Badhwar notes. One year ago, 82% of corporate databases were not encrypted. Now the number has dropped to 49%, marking a 67% improvement. However, he continues, the decline is most likely due to compliance and not because companies are becoming more security-conscious overall.\n\n\"I have to say, because this is one of those outlier trends related to improvement … I'm more inclined to say the majority is driven by the visibility and audits that GDPR is driving,\" he says. This isn't to say companies are excelling in compliance, however. Researchers found on average, businesses fail 30% of CIS Foundations' best practices, 50% of PCI requirements, and 23% of NIST CSF requirements.\n\nVisibility, along with speed of innovation, are two factors causing challenges in the cloud, Badhwar adds. As organizations rapidly adopt cloud services, security teams are often left in the dark when it comes to the applications developers are putting in the cloud. The cloud provides new tools and features to developers, who want to use them right away and don't consult with security as they're building.\n\n\"When you don't have visibility, how can you do any security or policy enforcement?\" Badhwar points out.\n\nRelated Content:\n\nKelly Sheridan is the Staff Editor at Dark Reading, where she focuses on cybersecurity news and analysis.

    "article_text": "A data-analytics firm hired by the Republican National Committee last year to gather political information about US voters accidentally leaked the sensitive personal details of roughly 198 million citizens earlier this month. And it's now facing its first class-action lawsuit.\n\nDeep Root Analytics, a data firm contracted by the RNC, stored details of about 61% of the US population on an Amazon cloud server without password protection for roughly two weeks before it was discovered by security researcher Chris Vickery on June 12.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit, filed by James and Linda McAleer of Florida and all others similarly situated, alleges Deep Root failed to \"secure and safeguard the public's personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, reddit.com browsing history, and voter ID number, which Deep Root collected from many sources, including the Republican National Committee.\"\n\nThe data exposed by Deep Root included 1.1 terabytes \"of entirely unsecured personal information\" compiled by Deep Root and at least two other Republican contractors, TargetPoint Consulting, Inc., and Data Trust, according to an analysis from the cybersecurity firm UpGuard.\n\n\"In total, the personal information of potentially near all of America's 200 million registered voters was exposed, including names, dates of birth, home addresses, phone numbers, and voter registration details, as well as data described as 'modeled' voter ethnicities and religions,\" UpGuard said.\n\nThe lawsuit says that President Donald Trump \"is on record denouncing these sorts of breaches as 'gross negligence.'\"\n\nIt says that \"as a direct and proximite cause of Deep Root's conduct,\" those exposed in the data breach may be vulnerable to identity theft and \"a loss of privacy,\" and argue that the \"actual damages\" exceed $5 million.\n\nThe exposed information did not include highly sensitive information like Social Security numbers, and much of it was publicly available voter-registration data provided by state government officials, a company spokesman told Business Insider on Tuesday.\n\n\"Since this event has come to our attention, we have updated the access settings and put protocols in place to prevent further access,\" Deep Root said in a statement. \"We take full responsibility for this situation.\"\n\nDeep Root didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nBut the exposed database combined people's personal information and political inclinations — including proprietary information gathered via predictive modeling tools — to create a detailed profile of nearly 200 million Americans that would be a \"gold mine\" for anyone looking to target and manipulate voters, said Archie Agarwal, the founder of the cybersecurity firm ThreatModeler.\n\n\"This is the mother lode of all leaks,\" Agarwal said Monday. \"Governments are made or broken on this. I don't even have the words to describe it.\"\n\nJoe Loomis, the founder and chief technology officer at the cybersecurity firm CyberSponse, predicted that a series of lawsuits against Deep Root over the accidental leak would prove damaging.\n\n\"Even if it was human error and not intentional, one IT person is probably going to put this company out of business,\" he said.\n\nRead the full complaint below:",

    "article_text": "A conservative analytics firm apparently scraped a huge trove of Reddit data as part of its voter-targeting efforts. As reported by Gizmodo, GOP-contracted company Deep Root Analytics accidentally put a folder titled “reddit” on a publicly accessible web server along with other internal records, which cyber risk analyst Chris Vickery discovered last week. It contains 170GB of data from several subreddits, but no indication of how Deep Root might be using the information.\n\nThe subreddits in question range from innocuous to controversial. One was the banned subreddit r/fatpeoplehate, which Gizmodo speculates was picked for its connection to Trump fans — a FiveThirtyEight analysis of r/The_Donald members found that outside explicitly political subreddits, these users overlapped most strongly with r/fatpeoplehate members. But Deep Root also collected information from mountain-biking and Spanish-speaking subreddits, which have no such connection.\n\nDeep Root leaked profiles of nearly 200 million potential voters as well, and it’s possible that it was trying to match names to Reddit profiles — which would give them a deep look at the preferences of specific voters. Gizmodo notes that the Obama campaign matched voter records with Facebook profiles, but it’s unclear that someone could do the same with Reddit, where few people operate under their real names. The company could also simply be looking for correlations in Reddit users’ interests, which could help predict which messages will resonate with specific categories of voters. All we can say for sure from this leak is that political analysts are watching Reddit — which, given its prominence during the election, isn’t a surprise.",

The exposed data included contact information and estimates of political preferences for around eighty percent of voting-age Americans.\n\nOn June 19, researcher Chris Vickery of the security firm UpGuard announced that he had found Deep Root had configured that data to be available to any who visited Deep Root's Amazon cloud storage account without needing to log in.

The files also contained big data approximations of individual's political views.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Deep Root was negligent in the way it protected data and seeks to cover two classes of victims — the general public and Florida residents in particular.\n\nZimmerman said his team was still fact-finding to assess what damages might be.\n\nMisconfigured security settings are a common, if potentially devastating, mistake. Vickery has built a reputation for scouring unsecured documents and databases to find find major intellectual property infoormation and government secrets accidentally left in the open.\n\nFinds have ranged from login credentials for a top secret U.S. intelligence project being run by a major private contractor, to a private intelligence-assembled terrorist watch list and voter rolls in Mexico.\n\n“The lawsuit is entirely without merit,\" a Deep Root spokesman said in a statement. \"We will fight it vigorously.”",

Elijah Cummings and Jerry Nadler sent a letter to Cambridge Analytica's CEO Alexander Nix and Giles-Parscale cofounder Brad Parscale — who also served as the Trump campaign's digital director — in October. The letter asked whether their firms received \"information from a foreign government or foreign actor\" at any point during the election.\n\nThe letter was also sent to the heads of Deep Root Analytics, TargetPoint Consulting, and The Data Trust, which were among the outfits hired by the Republican National Committee to bolster the Trump campaign's data operation.\n\nWhereas Deep Root, TargetPoint, and The Data Trust responded to the documents request, Cambridge Analytica did not. Parscale's response, moreover, was insufficient, the Democrats said.\n\n\"As I made clear in the 60 Minutes interview cited in your letter, I share your concerns and would not want foreign governments meddling in our elections,\" Parscale wrote, referring to his interview with CBS earlier this year about Russia's election interference. \"But as I stated in that same interview, I do not have any firsthand knowledge of foreign interference in the 2016 election.\"\n\nHe added: \"I respectfully decline to make document productions and respond to inquiries that are duplicative\" of the work being done by the congressional intelligence committees and special counsel Robert Mueller.\"\n\nParscale's letter mirrored those written by the RNC data firms and used virtually the same language — with one notable exception. Whereas the firms' letters included a line denying that they had had contact with any \"foreign government or foreign actor,\" Parscale's did not.\n\n\"Giles-Parscale and Cambridge Analytica did not deny that they had contacts or communications with foreign governments or foreign actors during the 2016 campaign,\" Cummings and Nadler wrote in a letter on Thursday to House Oversight Chair Trey Gowdy and House Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte.\n\nThey continued:\n\n\"Because the first three companies have asserted unequivocally that none of their employees had contacts with any foreign agents during the presidential campaign, we are willing to delay any further inquiry unless or until evidence to the contrary emerges. However, neither Giles Parscale nor Cambridge Analytica have denied these contacts. We therefore request that our committees issue subpoenas to these companies to compel the production of the information they are withholding from Congress.\"\n\nParscale and Cambridge Analytica have come under the microscope as congressional investigators probe whether voter information stolen by Russian hackers from election databases in several states made its way to the Trump campaign. Investigators are also examining whether the Trump campaign's data firms coordinated with Russia to disseminate fake news and propaganda in particular states and districts.\n\nThe data operation Parscale directed was supervised by Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has landed in Mueller's crosshairs over his contacts with Russia's ambassador and the CEO of a sanctioned Russian bank in December.\n\nThe Trump campaign hired Cambridge Analytica in June 2016 to help target ads using voter data collected from approximately 230 million US adults. The firm's CEO, Alexander Nix, reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange that month to offer help in finding Hillary Clinton's \"missing\" emails.\n\nIt is still unclear how much Cambridge Analytica actually did for the campaign. But Trump campaign aides and even current and former Cambridge employees have consistently tried to downplay its role.\n\nGiles-Parscale and Cambridge Analytica did not immediately return a request for comment.",

    "article_text": "AggregateIQ, the Victoria consultancy that was suspended by Facebook amid controversy over its role in political campaigns in Britain and elsewhere, worked on a range of smaller elections in Canada – including an ill-fated comeback last year by a former mayor in Newfoundland.\n\nA list of AggregateIQ’s Canadian clients is detailed in files uncovered online in late March by UpGuard Inc. The U.S. cybersecurity consulting firm discovered some of the inner workings of AggregateIQ after the B.C. company had failed to protect computer code and other files its software developers had housed on an online service.\n\nOne name revealed in UpGuard’s findings is that of Andy Wells, who resigned as mayor of St. John’s in 2008, after serving for about a decade. In 2017, Mr. Wells ran for his old job but finished a distant second.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Wells said he hired AggregateIQ after reading about the firm’s work in the 2016 Brexit vote.\n\n“They didn’t turn out to be very useful,” said Mr. Wells. AggregateIQ worked on his website, provided advice and used only publicly available voter information, he said. “I wouldn’t recommend them to anybody.”\n\nOpen this photo in gallery Whistleblower Christopher Wylie. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nAggregateIQ’s work on a lost civic campaign in Newfoundland has become a footnote for a company that is being probed by privacy commissioners from Britain, Canada and British Columbia. The firm was catapulted into public view over its role in the 2016 Brexit vote. For the past several weeks, Canadian whistle-blower Chris Wylie has been publicly denouncing AggregateIQ, saying he helped set it up before it went on to deploy questionable campaign tactics to influence voters during Brexit and in the United States, Nigeria and Trinidad.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chris Vickery, UpGuard’s director of cyberrisk research, will appear as a technical expert at the House of Commons standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics. The committee meeting is about the misuse of personal information involving the British political consultancy Cambridge Analytica and data mined from Facebook, a scandal to which AggregateIQ has been tied.\n\nAggregateIQ was suspended by Facebook on April 6. The Victoria company has said it had never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica and has never managed or had access to any Facebook data from Cambridge Analytica. AggregateIQ did not respond Sunday to a request for comment.\n\nIt was an eye-opening moment, once it hits you: ’Oh my god, this is what they’re using to influence elections across the globe. — Chris Vickery, UpGuard’s director of cyberrisk research\n\nMr. Vickery discovered AggregateIQ’s work in late March. UpGuard has already published information about AggregateIQ’s Brexit efforts, where it worked closely with campaigns to leave the European Union, and for Ted Cruz, in his failed U.S. presidential bid last year. None of the information, however, included personal details of individual voters.\n\nNow, Mr. Vickery is set to talk about AggregateIQ’s work in Canada, which appears to be more mundane than work it has done elsewhere. UpGuard’s research highlights AggregateIQ’s efforts for politicians who were previously reported to have worked with AggregateIQ. The list includes three BC Liberal candidates in last year’s provincial election, former finance minister Michael de Jong among them. It also includes Todd Stone, a Liberal MLA who ran for his party’s leadership early this year, and for the BC Green Party in 2016. Mr. Wells was the new name.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWhile AggregateIQ’s work in Canadian politics appears to be straightforward campaigning, there have been some interesting crossovers. For example, in Mr. de Jong’s campaign, AggregateIQ appears to have reused a graphic previously used for changebritain.org, a pro-Brexit group that was formed after the referendum.\n\nUpGuard’s Mr. Vickery has made a name for himself over the past several years as he has discovered unguarded yet sensitive data online. Mr. Vickery said the typical data leak stems from basic human errors – effectively leaving the door open – rather than a malicious hacker breaking through defences. A major find by Mr. Vickery was the personal information of almost 200 million voters in the U.S., left unsecured last year by Deep Root Analytics, which worked for the Republican National Committee.\n\nWhen Mr. Vickery saw the news of AggregateIQ’s connection with the Cambridge Analytica-Facebook story, he looked online for clues about its work. He found AggregateIQ’s exposed data on the software development hub GitLab on March 20.\n\n“I started poking around and I realized, ‘Holy cow, the registration is open,’ ” Mr. Vickery said.\n\nOnce inside the code repositories, Mr. Vickery saw how AggregateIQ did its online campaign work.\n\n“It was an eye-opening moment, once it hits you: ‘Oh my god, this is what they’re using to influence elections across the globe,’ ” he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Vickery said the sum of AggregateIQ’s work showed “the engine or heart of tracking people, figuring out what their political leanings are, influencing them … and focusing your message and seeing how effective various ads are.”",

    "article_text": "A handful of elected officials used more than $28 million from their campaign accounts for investments, making it the second largest category of expenditures in the 2018 election cycle\n\nCandidates for state office in Texas have spent more than $120 million so far in the 2018 election cycle — and a handful of them sunk a big chunk of that into investments that ranged from government T-bills to tech stocks, a Texas Tribune analysis shows.\n\nThe investments exceeded $28 million, making such expenditures the second highest category after advertising even though just four candidates reported investments from their campaign accounts — Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, Sen. John Whitmire of Houston and GOP Comptroller Glenn Hegar.\n\nWhitmire, a Democrat, sank nearly $9 million into the stock market, buying $1.4 million worth of Amazon shares, $850,000 in carmaker Tesla, $619,000 in airline company United Continental Holdings Inc. and $300,000 in Energy Transfer Equity [founded by billionaire Kelcy Warren], among other purchases, according to campaign filings. He also spent more than $13,000 on Houston Astros tickets and more than $14,000 for tickets to Houston Texans games.\n\nRepublican Abbott, meanwhile, is doing his part to nourish the federal government’s appetite for debt-financed budgets by buying more than $8 million in U.S. Treasury bills; Abbott had over $6 million stashed in safe certificates of deposit, which were also the preferred investment vehicle for Hegar, who bought $2.4 million worth of CDs; Patrick reported $1.8 million in CDs and a savings account.\n\nAbbott was both the biggest spender and the largest recipient of campaign largesse. He shelled out $16.3 million from Jan. 2, 2017, through late February of this year.\n\nPatrick, who had the largest single advertising expenditure for the period — $3.4 million for TV spots paid to Davis Lenz Media of Dallas — came in second with $10.4 million spent. Other big spenders included losing GOP Senate candidate Phillip Huffines [$6 million], his victorious Republican opponent Angela Paxton [$2.7 million], and Land Commissioner George P. Bush [$3.8 million].\n\nAll told, Republican candidates reported spending $102.6 million, nearly five times more than Democrats, who spent $21 million, for a total of $123.6 million in expenditures reported between the beginning of last year up to the week before the March primaries.\n\nThe candidates spent $39.6 million for advertising, $11.5 million to consultants and $4.8 million on donations to other candidates and entities. The Tribune did not count spending in federal races.\n\nThe Tribune analysis for state campaign expenditures does include money that politicians sank into investments.\n\nAbbott’s investments were on top of the $16 million he spent for advertising, consultants, polling and other hard campaign expenses. According to a 1994 opinion from the Texas Ethics Commission, the Election Code allows state politicians to invest as much — whether for loss or gain — as their wagering hearts desire. The only restriction: “An investment may not constitute a conversion of a political contribution to the personal use of the candidate or officeholder,” the opinion said.\n\nAmong other expenditures for the period:\n\nAt least two politicians used their campaign accounts to buy vehicles. Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller spent $37,600 to buy a 2016 Chevy Tahoe SUV from Classic Chevrolet of Sugar Land, and another $10,000 on a used truck that he bought from the Texas Facilities Commission. State Rep. Jonathan Stickland, meanwhile, paid $12,650 for a 2008 Chevy Express 12000 passenger van.\n\nThere were only eight Democrats among the top 50 spenders [not including investments]: Valley-area Rep. Ryan Guillen [$655,000], lieutenant governor candidate Mike Collier [$611,000], Sen. Kirk Watson of Austin [$511,000], gubernatorial candidate Andrew White [$500,000]; Rep. René Oliveira of Brownsville [$430,000]; Sen. Royce West of Dallas [$414,000], defeated incumbent Rep. Roberto Alonzo of Dallas [$392,000]; and Whitmire [$357,000].\n\nThe biggest jet-setters of the 2018 primary season included Abbott, who spent $770,000 on travel-related expenses, much of it for chartered aircraft. Abbott also plunked down just under $6,000 for rooms at the Westin in Maryland to attend the presidential inauguration and almost $4,000 for lodging at the Houstonian for the 2017 Super Bowl; Patrick spent $185,000 in the travel category while Collier, his Democratic opponent, spent $44,000, most of it on mileage reimbursements, commercial airfare and modestly priced hotels.\n\nConsulting firms drawing down big dollars for consulting and advertising included Murphy Nasica — led by longtime GOP consultant Craig Murphy — which received at least $6 million for the period, including $1 million from GOP Rep. Charlie Geren of Fort Worth. Jordan Berry of Berry Communications pulled in more than $985,000, while Axiom Strategies, led by Jeff Roe, a strategist for U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, was paid more than $1.2 million.\n\nNorway Hill & Associates, the firm led by longtime Abbott [and previously Rick Perry] consultant Dave Carney, got at least $329,000 in fees; Abbott also spent $150,000 on campaign services from Deep Root Analytics, a conservative firm that acknowledged last year it accidentally leaked voters’ personal data.\n\nIn the polling services arena, longtime GOP pollster Mike Baselice’s firm, used by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and others, earned more than $612,000 for the period, while WPAi, led by Chris Wilson, which did polling for Abbott, Rep. Sarah Davis and others, got more than $680,000 for polling services. Ragnar Research Partners, led by pollster Chris Perkins and used by Bush, the land commissioner, earned more than $390,000.\n\nDisclosure: John Whitmire and Tesla Motors Inc. have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

    "article_text": "Introduction\n\nHalf of all Americans believe their personal information is less secure now than it was five years ago, and a sobering study from the Pew Research Center reveals how little faith the public has in organizations, whether governmental or private-sector, to protect their data—and with good reason. In 2017, there was a disastrous breach at Equifax, Yahoo’s admission that billions of its email accounts were compromised, Deep Root Analytics’ accidental leak of personal details of nearly two hundred million U.S. voters, and Uber’s attempt to conceal a breach that affected fifty-seven million accounts. Individuals are left stymied about what action they can take, if any, to protect their digital assets and identity.\n\nYet record-shattering data breaches and inadequate data-protection practices have produced only piecemeal legislative responses at the federal level, competing state laws, and a myriad of enforcement regimes. Most Western countries have already adopted comprehensive legal protections for personal data, but the United States—home to some of the most advanced, and largest, technology and data companies in the world—continues to lumber forward with a patchwork of sector-specific laws and regulations that fail to adequately protect data. U.S. citizens and companies suffer from this uneven approach—citizens because their data is not adequately protected, and companies because they are saddled with contradictory and sometimes competing requirements. It is past time for Congress to create a single legislative data-protection mandate to protect individuals’ privacy and reconcile the differences between state and federal requirements.\n\nA Patchwork of Existing Protections\n\nThe United States lacks a single, comprehensive federal law that regulates the collection and use of personal information. Instead, the government has approached privacy and security by regulating only certain sectors and types of sensitive information (e.g., health and financial), creating overlapping and contradictory protections.\n\nThe rules that govern health information illustrate this problem. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the United States’ primary health privacy and security law, only applies to “covered entities” holding “protected health information.” Federal regulators acknowledge [PDF] that most Americans have no grasp of when their health information is protected by the law and when it is not—or what security standards apply in either case. Separate privacy laws govern specific areas of the U.S. health-care system [PDF]: student immunizations and other school health records are generally covered by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which was enacted in 1974, when student records existed in physical file cabinets and not digital clouds. FERPA, in turn, intersects with and sometimes conflicts with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which does protect data, but only of children under the age of thirteen.\n\nWidespread collection of personal information puts [people's] privacy and security at risk.\n\nState laws add to this patchwork, particularly with respect to data breaches. Many states recognize that widespread collection of personal information [PDF] puts their residents’ privacy and security at risk. Starting with California, which enacted the first data-breach notification law in 2003, forty-eight states have passed laws that require individuals to be notified if their information is compromised. These laws have different and sometimes incompatible provisions regarding what categories and types of personal information warrant protection, which entities are covered, and even what constitutes a breach. Notification requirements also vary: New Jersey requires that the state police cybercrime unit be notified, while Maryland requires that the state attorney general be notified before any affected individual is.\n\nEnforcement of these laws is also complicated. While state attorneys general have an important role to play, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) considers itself the “top cop on the privacy beat.” The FTC has the general power to prohibit “unfair and deceptive trade practices” under Section 5 of the FTC Act, and has attempted to establish a data-security baseline through over sixty different enforcement actions. However, companies have begun to aggressively push back against the FTC’s legal authority to police data-security practices, and the FTC has limited jurisdiction over banks, insurance companies, nonprofit entities, and even some internet service providers.\n\nThe Challenge of Preventing and Responding to Data Breaches\n\nExperienced security professionals advise even the most sophisticated organizations that they will eventually experience a breach. Even organizations with multiple layers of digital and physical security are vulnerable to the persistent threats of commercial and governmental intrusion, as well as inept or intentionally malicious insiders. Perfect security is impossible, and the informational injuries that can result from the collection and (mis)use of data are constantly evolving.\n\nAs a result, many lawmakers sought to respond to the Equifax breach and similar breaches by reassessing data-breach notification rules. Members of Congress are reintroducing data-breach protection proposals, and industry voices have suggested that the United States could have finally reached the “tipping point” that will lead to the creation of a single national data-breach notification standard.\n\nBreach-notification laws . . . place the burden on the individuals whose information has been compromised.\n\nThis is a common refrain after every headline-making breach, but enacting data-breach legislation, while well-intentioned, will likely result in little meaningful improvement for data-security practices. While breach-notification laws shame companies that do not disclose breaches, they ultimately place the burden on the individuals whose information has been compromised: they need to maintain ongoing vigilance about identity theft and other fraud, some of which could occur years after the initial incident. Eliminating conflicting state notice provisions at the federal level, while simplifying the experience for both consumer and institution, does nothing to address this problem.\n\nCompanies need clearer rules, and individuals need to be able to incentivize companies to secure data. Most data breaches, even with the costs of disclosure and response and the attendant reputational harm, do not result in significant financial harm to companies. Even when regulators such as the FTC get involved, the likelihood of any monetary fine is small. A more comprehensive legal framework is needed: one that offers a mix of incentives for better security practices, disclosures, and individual protections.\n\nToward a Baseline Privacy and Security Proposal\n\nThe twenty-first-century economy will be fueled by personal data. But it is not yet clear what rules will govern this information, with whom information will be shared, and what protections will be put in place. A baseline data-protection law would provide a legal framework for answering these questions.\n\nSuch a proposal is not new. The FTC has continually called on [PDF] Congress to enact flexible and technologically neutral privacy and security laws, and nearly six years ago the Barack Obama administration put forward a blueprint for its Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, based on Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPs). The FIPPs are generally thought of as processes and procedures that organizations should implement; the Privacy Bill of Rights recognized that individual Americans have an ongoing interest in how information about them is collected, used, and shared by companies and government entities alike.\n\nThe rights proposed by the Obama administration were widely embraced by the advocacy community and civil society. However, the Obama administration’s proposal was a victim of bad timing and lost momentum. Enamored with Silicon Valley, the administration largely let the industry craft its own rules, and a draft legislative bill was quietly put forward only three years after the initial proposal. Since then, data practices across all industry sectors have continued to fall short of individual privacy and security expectations.\n\nLawmakers’ failure to provide users with a set of privacy rights has made the United States a global outlier.\n\nThe Donald J. Trump administration appears to have little appetite for technology policy or legal regulation in general, and lawmakers’ continuing failure to provide users with a set of privacy rights has also made the United States a global outlier. While the U.S. legal framework on personal data has not meaningfully changed in several decades, the European Union has enacted multiple data-protection directives. With the revised General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the European Union has become the focal point of the global dialogue on individual data privacy. In contrast to U.S. law, EU law protects all personal data, regardless of who collects it or how it is processed. Other advanced economies, such as Canada, Israel, and Japan, have pivoted toward creating privacy regimes that are compatible with the EU’s GDPR rather than with the patchwork approach of the United States. This puts U.S. companies at a disadvantage globally as emerging economies adopt simpler, and often more EU-style, comprehensive approaches.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe U.S. Congress should join other advanced economies in their approach to data protection by creating a single comprehensive data-protection framework. Meaningful federal laws and regulations should seek to resolve the differences among the existing federal and state legal rights and responsibilities. This would not only simplify compliance for U.S. companies, but would also strengthen and bring the United States in line with emerging data-protection norms. Congress could implement an effective baseline privacy regime with at least the following four qualities.\n\nFirst, the law should cover all institutions, not just tech companies, credit-rating agencies, and other narrow sectors of the economy. Data protection is not only part of corporate social responsibility in a digital age, it is also both an institutional risk and an essential compliance function for any organization that collects, uses, or shares personal information or other potentially sensitive consumer data.\n\nSecond, the law should harmonize the inconsistencies and fill the gaps created by the existing sectoral approach. Health information is sensitive regardless of whether it is input into a consumer application, generated by a wearable device, or conveyed to a medical professional. A baseline privacy law could polish away the inconsistent consent requirements, access rights, and security protections around health information that exist in between and outside of HIPAA, FERPA, and COPPA, for example.\n\nIncentives for companies to protect data should skew toward prevention, rather than self-flagellating disclosures.\n\nThird, incentives for companies to protect data should skew toward prevention, rather than self-flagellating disclosures. Disclosure after the fact only helps the legal and compliance industries that have cropped up in the wake of recent breaches. By the time a breach is disclosed, harm could already have befallen hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of individuals. Companies should offer easy-to-use individual access, correction, and deletion mechanisms for users’ data, and documented risk assessments and other compliance requirements, which leave a paper trail. When these mechanisms are backed by the force of law, companies are put on notice that they need to prioritize data security, which in turn gives privacy and security professionals and consumer advocates more leverage to push for better industry practice. If the United States adopted the significant fines for noncompliance seen in the European Union’s GDPR, corporate practice could be reshaped—for not just major technology firms but also small and medium-sized enterprises and nonprofit entities.\n\nFourth, the U.S. legal framework should recognize and provide mechanisms to address the harms that result from privacy violations. Lawmakers and courts recognize the harm of breaches, but the definition of a “privacy harm” should be expanded. Identity theft is one such harm, but so too are the inconveniences suffered by affected individuals and their gnawing sense that they lack control over their “digital selves.” These less quantifiable harms that result from the exposure of bits and bytes of individuals’ personal lives should be recognized by law: as the depths of these harms are plumbed and addressed over time, individuals should be afforded a private right of action to hold companies accountable, and regulators should have the ability to penalize entities that flout their duty to be responsible stewards of personal information. Jack Balkin, the director of Yale Law School’s Information Society Project, has suggested that companies be thought of as “information fiduciaries” and proposed a grand bargain that would extend a duty of care for personal information in exchange for legal certainty and safe harbors for industry.\n\nA simpler and more comprehensive approach to individual digital dignity is warranted, especially after this past year of increasing magnitude of breaches and digital stewardship failures. A baseline privacy framework could ensure that all companies become responsible and ethical stewards of data, bring the United States in line with global standards, and better protect the data of U.S. citizens.\n\nThis Cyber Brief is part of the Digital and Cyberspace Policy program.

Loading... 48-million Data Profiles Left Exposed on AWS Server\n\nLocalBlox, a private intelligence agency, scraped profiles from Facebook, LinkedIn & Twitter\n\nA private intelligence agency accidentally leaked over 48-million user profiles when it left them exposed on an Amazon Web Server. The company, LocalBlox, scrapes data from social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Zillow. The data was stored in an Amazon S3 storage bucket that was not password protected.\n\nThat’s fairly egregious.\n\nOf course, this is nothing new. The entire world has been abuzz after Facebook disclosed that its now-defunct Graph API allowed pretty much any app connected to it scrape the profile data of users and their friends. Cambridge Analytica was the firm that got all the headlines given their political nature. But make no mistake, there are thousands of apps and companies that scraped data through that API. Some of the businesses behind those apps are no longer operational, too. Who knows what happened to that data. One expert compared the situation to what happens to nukes when a nuclear state fails. Who knows what’s happened to it, where it will turn up or what bad actors have obtained it.\n\nAnd frankly, LocalBlox isn’t even the first company of its type to have this kind of issue. Last year nearly every single voter record in the United States was compromised when Deep Root Analytics leaked them.\n\n“Massive breaches through unsecured AWS S3 buckets continues to be a troubling trend,” said Javvad Malik, a Security Advocate at AlienVault. “While cloud providers take care of certain aspects of security, it is imperative that organisations ensure they are doing their part to ensure the security of data that is uploaded. As with other aspects of security, cloud environments need to be continually monitored and the security assessed.”\n\nThe data was discovered by Chris Vickery, the same guy who discovered the Deep Root Analytics leak.\n\n“Part of what they did was take the Facebook search function and put in a special query related to phone numbers, email addresses and such and gathered a lot of information on people, just automatically like a bot,” Vickery told ThreatPost at RSA.\n\nLocalBlox claims to offer “the world’s most comprehensive cross device identity graph on businesses, consumers and geo audiences.”\n\nIt used the data it scraped across various social media networks to create digital profiles on 48-million people. As I mentioned earlier, Facebook has closed the API that was abused, but we will never fully know the scale to which it was exploited. The pressing question isn’t what data Facebook has on you, it’s really how many other entities has Facebook shared that information with. Up until now, Facebook hasn’t just been collecting its own data it’s been serving as an output for various shady firms and organizations that are compiling it along with data taken from other sources to create surprisingly in-depth dossiers on pretty much anyone with a digital footprint.\n\n“The data captured was interesting in that it consolidated personal information scraped from thousands of web sites,” Christopher Littlejohns, an EMEA Engineer at Synopsis told Information Security Buzz. “The net result is that it made it easy for an attacker to gain access to a pool of data that would be valuable for subsequent social engineering attacks, account hacking and identity fraud. Any company that collects, consolidates, but does not adequately secure such data is essentially exposing people to higher risk of being targeted.”\n\nHere’s the thing, there’s really not much you – as an individual – can do to protect yourself from this kind of stuff. While Facebook and many others across the social media sphere are making changes to better protect personal data, the toothpaste is already out of the tube. If you’ve been using social media your data has likely been compromised to some extent. And even if you’re not, Facebook can identify non-users in the pictures its members upload.\n\nWhile we should never stop fighting for our digital rights, it may be time to admit that when it comes to keeping our personal data from being compromised, that ship has already sailed.\n\nHere’s a video of Chris Vickery, who discovered the leak, discussing it with ThreatPost at RSA yesterday.",

Investigators have been looking into whether Russia provided the campaign with voter information stolen by Russian hackers from election databases in several states, and whether the Trump campaign helped Russia target its political ads to specific demographics and voting precincts.\n\nThe general counsels for Facebook, Twitter, and Google gave enigmatic replies when asked by the House Intelligence Committee last month whether they had investigated \"who was mimicking who\" when it came to online ads promoted by both the Trump campaign and Russia during the election.\n\nFacebook said in September that about 25% of the ads purchased by Russians during the election \"were geographically targeted,\" though many analysts have said they find it difficult to believe that foreign entities would have had the kind of granular knowledge of American politics necessary to target specific demographics and voting precincts.\n\nFacebook's general counsel Colin Stretch paused before indicating that the committee had access to intelligence that could better contextualize the information Facebook had turned over.\n\n\"We've provided all relevant information to the committee, and we do think it's an important function of this committee, because you have access to a broader set of information than any single company will,\" Stretch said.\n\n\"I agree with that,\" said Kent Walker, Google's counsel and senior vice president.\n\n\"Same for Twitter,\" Twitter general counsel Sean Edgett said.\n\n'We brought in Cambridge Analytica'\n\nInvestigators have long wondered whether the data-mining and analysis firm Cambridge Analytica served as a link between the campaign's data operation and Russia.\n\nThat scrutiny intensified following revelations that Cambridge CEO Alexander Nix reached out to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in June 2016 asking for access to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's \"stolen\" emails.\n\nIt is still unclear how much Cambridge Analytica actually did for the campaign. Trump campaign aides and even current and former Cambridge employees have consistently tried to downplay its role.\n\nParscale was asked about Cambridge during his interview with the House Intelligence Committee in October. The ranking members of the House Oversight and Judiciary committees sent him a separate letter that month asking whether his firm received \"information from a foreign government or foreign actor\" at any point during the election.\n\nThe letter was also sent to Nix and the heads of Deep Root Analytics, TargetPoint Consulting, and The Data Trust — firms hired by the Republican National Committee last year to bolster the Trump campaign's data operation.\n\nDeep Root accidentally leaked the sensitive personal details of roughly 198 million citizens in June, as its database was left exposed on the open web for nearly two weeks. The firm had stored details of about 61% of the US population on an Amazon cloud server without password protection.\n\nWhereas Deep Root, TargetPoint, and The Data Trust responded to the documents request, Nix did not.\n\nParscale's letter, meanwhile, mirrored those written by the RNC data firms and used virtually the same language — with one notable exception.\n\nWhereas the firms' letters included a line denying that they had had contact with any \"foreign government or foreign actor,\" Parscale's did not.\n\nIn a postelection interview, Kushner told Forbes that he had been keenly interested in Facebook's \"micro-targeting\" capabilities from early on.\n\n\"I called somebody who works for one of the technology companies that I work with, and I had them give me a tutorial on how to use Facebook micro-targeting,\" Kushner said.\n\n\"We brought in Cambridge Analytica,\" he continued. \"I called some of my friends from Silicon Valley who were some of the best digital marketers in the world. And I asked them how to scale this stuff ... We basically had to build a $400 million operation with 1,500 people operating in 50 states, in five months to then be taken apart. We started really from scratch.\"",

    "article_text": "It’s common knowledge that political parties in the United States collect information about potential voters, but exactly how comprehensive is the data they collet?\n\nTo explore that question, we set out to find detailed descriptions of 176 data points the Republican National Committee (RNC) has been gathering about voters since at least 2008. The data points were published on June 19 by a cybersecurity company after one of its analysts found a trove of voter records that had been inadvertently left on a public Amazon server. Our search led us to previously unreported data sources, providing a more complete view of what the Republican party tracks about American voters.\n\nThe voter records were discovered on June 12 by Chris Vickery, a risk analyst at the security firm UpGuard. While scanning the internet for misconfigured systems, Vickery came across an 11-terabyte cache of election-related data that he later learned had been compiled by three Republican contractors: TargetPoint Consulting, the Data Trust, and Deep Root Analytics. In a public statement, Deep Root took responsibility for leaving the data on the Amazon server where Vickery found it, saying the data had only been used to “inform local television ad buying.”\n\nIncluded within the files Vickery found were 102 massive spreadsheets–two for every state and the District of Columbia. For each state, one file contained voter data based on the 2008 election, and the other based on the 2012 election. In its blog post, UpGuard listed the 176 categories that made up the column headers in those spreadsheets. Some were self-explanatory, such as “FirstName” and “OfficialParty,” but others were not, such as “VH12PP” and “RNCCalcParty.” A few were somewhat clear, such as “ModeledEthnicGroup,” which suggests data about a voter’s ethnic group as determined by predictive modeling, but what those groups were was less clear. UpGuard declined to share further details about the data, citing the inherent privacy violations that could come with such a disclosure.\n\nHowever, we were able to match up the categories revealed by UpGuard with other sources and obtain detailed descriptions of most of them.\n\nFirst, we found that the unique field names listed in UpGuard’s blog post match up with those used in a now-offline API that appears to have been built by the Data Trust for the RNC. The RNC’s API, which was previously hosted at docs.api.gop.com, is no longer online, and cached versions of it only show an Amazon AWS login page. But very specific Google searches, such as site:docs.api.gop.com VH12G matched 137 of the 176 categories UpGuard listed, and most of those revealed the category’s descriptions. Some fields were slightly different, listed in UpGuard’s post as “RegistrationAddr1” and in the API as “Registration_Addr1,” for example, but the added underscores were the only inconsistencies.\n\nA Google search revealing the description of “VH12G” (Google)\n\nAdditionally, a GitHub account owned by the Data Trust includes a repository called “direct-api-examples” that also references many of the field names, and includes example uses of what appears to be an early version of the API, which it calls the “GOP Data Trust API.”\n\nA repository in the Data Trust’s GitHub account (GitHub)\n\nOf course, the link between this API and the data found by Vickery is unclear and unconfirmed, but it is apparent that the matching fields describe the same data. Asked for a comment about the API, the Data Trust referred us to the RNC, and the RNC did not respond to our questions.\n\nFurther insight into the nature of the data came from a post on Stack Overflow that included JSON data, which also used many of the field names. The provenance of the data is unclear, but nearly all of the 59 categories it contains match the categories in the RNC’s API and those shared by UpGuard, including uniquely named fields like “RNCCalcParty” and “MADR_LastCleanse.” Because the data on Stack Overflow contained actual values, it helped us to expand the descriptions of some of the columns.\n\nA post on Stack Overflow containing JSON data that shares field names with the voter data found by Vickery (Stack Overflow)\n\nIn aggregate, these clues allowed us to compile the lists below. They contain descriptions of 137 data points the Republican party knows, or at least wants to know, about every American voter. (According to UpGuard, the database that Vickery found did not contain data in every field for every voter.) All of the descriptions came from the RNC’s API, except in cases where the category names had a match in the API, but where the descriptions of those categories did not show up. In those cases, we put the descriptions we inferred from the field names in italics. Some descriptions include “sample data,” which came from the data posted on Stack Overflow. The 39 fields we were unable to identify were those ranging from “PG01” to “PG39.”\n\nYour likely religion and ethnicity\n\nThe RNC and the Democratic National Committee both pay millions of dollars to data analysis firms like Deep Root to combine information provided by states with data gathered from cold-calls, canvasing efforts, campaign contributions, and social media. Then those datapoints are synthesized to determine how you’re likely to vote and what kind of messaging you’ll respond to. The fields below refer to data derived through that kind of analysis. Notably, the codes for “ModeledEthnicGroup” are limited to “H” for Hispanic and “B” for black, but the field in the Stack Overflow data was populated with a “Z.”\n\nRNCCalcParty: RNC Calculated Partisan score: 1=Hard Rep, 2=Lean Rem [SIC], 3=Swing/Ind, 4=Lean Dem, 5=Hard Dem\n\nRNC Calculated Partisan score: 1=Hard Rep, 2=Lean Rem [SIC], 3=Swing/Ind, 4=Lean Dem, 5=Hard Dem StateCalcParty: Likely a state-level partisanship score similar to RNCCalParty\n\nLikely a state-level partisanship score similar to RNCCalParty ModeledEthnicity: Modeled Ethnicity – Ethnicity Code.

    "article_text": "With a big mouth, plenty of buzz, and a yuuge media presence, does Donald Trump still need a data-driven get-out-the-vote operation to win in Iowa and New Hampshire?\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe real-estate developer has disrupted the presidential campaign like few other candidates in history and has shown an amazing ability–through the sheer forces of his personality and a populist movement receptive to his message–to survive the outrage over some of his offensive statements and to dodge bullets fired at him by powerful politicians and “fair and balanced” media outlets. But now that there’s a real likelihood of him winning the nomination, the Trump campaign is being forced to suffer the tedium and drudgery of the ground game, which involves hiring geeks to crunch the data and comb through voter lists. The Trump campaign has been secretive about the extent of its get-out-the-vote operation in those two key states, but insiders believe that it’s far from the high-tech enterprises of the Cruz, Bush, and Rubio campaigns and that they’re playing catch-up. True to form, the Trump campaign declined to comment or provide information on its high-tech campaigning apparatus to Fast Company. “The silence is deafening,” said one insider. The person said the community of campaign data scientists is a small one, and one usually knows who’s working for whom, and generally what they’re doing–especially in presidential races. The consensus among data scientists and digital strategists is that only last October did Trump begin seriously assembling his data ground game. Politico reported earlier this month that the Trump campaign started discussions with the voter data provider L2 in October and “ultimately entered into an agreement.” Regulations require the Trump campaign to report money spent to license any voter database. No such line item appears in any filings for the first three quarters of 2015. The most recent filing show expenses up to September 30, so we can be sure that the campaign did not formally contract with L2 or any other voter database company before October. The campaign will have to file its expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2015 by January 31, so we’ll soon know for sure if it’s paid L2 for data. Separately, the campaign acquired a voter list from the Republican National Committee (RNC), which it will combine with the L2 data. Such lists are provided free to GOP campaigns, with the agreement that the campaign adds to or corrects the data in the list, then provides the updated list back to the RNC to lend to other GOP campaigns.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPolitico also reported that the Trump campaign hired a couple of low-profile former RNC data strategists–Matt Braynard and Witold Chrabaszcz–to work with the data. The two have reportedly been working to integrate the L2 and RNC data with voter data collected by the Trump campaign, with the goal of targeting get-out-the-vote communications at non-traditional or unregistered voters. But one insider says that Braynard and Chrabaszcz aren’t that well known in the small community of digital strategists and data scientists who are instrumental to making GOP campaigns more competitive using data. Most presidential campaigns typically begin working with the voter data eight or nine months before the start of the primary season, say data strategists. The Trump campaign would have had no more than three months. And Trump’s staff of two digital strategists is hardly enough for a serious data operation, which usually employ at least a dozen staffers. Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior advisor to President Obama who worked on both the 2008 and 2012 campaigns, points out that, in recent history, a sophisticated ground game–built or borrowed–is table stakes for winning elections. “The candidates that have won in the past have either built an extensive ground operation (Bush in 2000), or have tapped into the existing grassroots operation of the evangelical community (Huckabee in ‘08 and Santorum in ‘12),” Pfeiffer wrote in an email to Fast Company. “Trump seems to be doing neither,” he added. The 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns invested heavily in targeting data and analytics to drive its successful get-out-the-vote campaigns.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHigh-profile GOP data strategist Zac Moffatt says essentially the same thing. “Historically turning out new voters across the board consistently in multiple states without a massive field program is impossible–but this campaign has had many firsts.” Moffatt, who is cofounder of the conservative ad targeting firm Targeted Victory, led the Romney campaign’s digital effort in the 2012 presidential campaign. Political Data In 2016 The data and software used in today’s political campaigns is similar that used in the advertising industry, and the goal is the same–connect with the right prospects at the right time with the right message over the right media. One key difference is that consumers’ political opinions are far more fluid than their opinions about, say, potato chips or deodorant. As the Ben Carson campaign can tell you, a candidate can be on top one day and heading for the cellar the next. This means that the campaign must be continually polling and surveying voters. Political campaigns typically acquire one or more datasets from a third-party provider like L2, Aristotle, or GOP Data Trust, or from their political party. Voters in these groups are often grouped in segments and scored on their party loyalty or likelihood of voting for the candidate. More resources, then, can be spent on communicating with voters with high scores. Campaigns with any degree of sophistication usually contract with an outside targeting firm like Cambridge Analytica, Deep Root Analytics, or Targeted Victory to further analyze and segment the data, target TV ads and digital media messages, and measure the results. All of these firms use their own unique approach to the job, employing their own unique mix of software and data. Other firms specialize in voter identification, telephonic or online polling and surveying, issue modeling, and data tools and support.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Trump camp hasn’t said what it’s been doing with its L2 and RNC data since acquiring it. Public statements by campaign officials give some clue. Trump’s campaign co-chair in New Hampshire, state representative Steve Stepanek, has said the campaign is focused on using phone calls to get non-traditional and unregistered voters out to vote. Voters in Iowa have also reported receiving emails and direct mail from the campaign. The phone numbers and email addresses could be coming from the RNC list Trump recently acquired. Until recently, sources say, the Trump campaign appears to have been relying almost exclusively on the “earned media” coverage generated by the candidate’s cult of personality on TV, in print, and in social media. “He doesn’t have to buy paid media because he’s got Fox News and NBC talking about him all day,” says Matt Oczkowski, director of product at the conservative ad targeting firm Cambridge Analytica. From a campaign’s point of view, that’s the most valuable kind of exposure you can get–and it’s free. “Some campaigns have a very hard time getting that kind of media attention,” says Michael Palmer of the voter database and analytics provider i360. They’ve had to spend more time creating their own news using other media channels, like trumpeting a new endorsement on social media.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“What I tell campaigns is that if they’re weak in one of those areas they need to bolster their efforts in the others,” Palmer says. Angst Power Trump’s messaging, polls show, resonates best with white, less-educated, and non-evangelical voters. It’s an angry group, and Trump seems to connect with, and give voice to, many of their frustrations, especially on hot-button issues like terrorism, immigration, and reproductive rights. How far can all that angst carry the Trump campaign? Farther already than anyone expected, to be sure. But will the feelings Trump inspires in his supporters spur them to action when it really counts–on caucus day? In Iowa that means getting up off the couch, getting in the car and driving through the snow and cold, then waiting for hours to caucus in some church basement or school classroom. That’s a lot harder than picking up the phone and expressing support for Trump to a pollster. And the demographic groups Trump attracts haven’t shown good turnout records in the past. In fact, exit polls show that past caucus goers look much different than Trump supporters–they’re older, college educated, and more likely to be evangelicals. In Iowa, around 120,000 people typically come out to GOP presidential caucuses. Some believe the Trump campaign will push that number up to around 150,000 by drawing out non-traditional caucus goers.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWhether or not those additional voters show up will mean the difference between a big night for Trump, and a close race, most likely with Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas). A CNN/ORC poll from last Thursday shows a 37% to 26% advantage for Trump among “likely” caucus goers. When CNN polled only people who participated in the most recent GOP caucus, Trump’s lead vanished, and Cruz takes a 30% to 28% lead. Will Trump’s “likelys” show up? The Trump people are banking on the hope that all those people who showed up for the rallies and speeches will show up to caucus and cast a vote for the Donald. But much of the draw for Trump’s events is the candidate’s bombast and celebrity. Many potential voters may be willing to wait in line for six hours to see Trump speak, but unwilling to caucus for him. Cruz Likes Data In contrast to the Trump campaign, the Ted Cruz campaign has perhaps the most advanced, or at least the most ambitious, data strategy, multiple sources said. Cruz has 10,000 people on the ground in Iowa, and they’re knocking on a thousand doors a day, a source with knowledge of the campaign said. Asked about sophistication of the Cruz digital strategy, the source explained it this way: When a Cruz volunteer walks up the someone’s door in Iowa or New Hampshire, they can see a variety of information about the household in the app running on their smartphone. They know who lives in the house and can pull up the right profile for the voting-age person who answers the door. The profile will contain basic demographic information like age and gender, along with deeper data like personality type and the person’s hot-button political issues. Based on that information the app pulls up one of a number of specialized scripts. The script is designed to steer the conversation toward the issues the person cares about, and to the candidate’s positions.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe Cruz campaign hired the “behavioral science company,” Cambridge Analytica — a newcomer to the U.S. political scene — to get beyond the simple demographics and polling data and develop an understanding of the personality traits that move voters to action. The campaign can then factor that data into its messaging strategy, Cambridge Analytica’s Oczkowski says. Cambridge Analytica says it has a database of 240 million voters nationwide, with as many as 2,000 data points on each. These data points include things like corporate information, voter files, and social media data. To add in the personality classification data the company says it conducts between 30,000 to 50,000 surveys nationwide every month. The company identifies groups with shared traits, and can match those groups with similar voter groups in a given state or precinct. A team of psychologists helps determine the types of messaging that might work best with the various groups. How well this will actually work on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire remains to be seen. Cambridge Analytica’s personality data are also used to decide which Cruz volunteers call which potential voters. The campaign says it’s found that volunteers are more persuasive when calling people with similar personality types to their own. The Cruz campaign’s app, “Ted Cruz 2016,” is also one of the most advanced of those being used by GOP campaigns. The app attempts to gamify support for the #cruzmissile, as some of his supporters call him. Points are awarded when a user retweets a Ted Cruz tweet, or when they post something for other app users, or makes a donation. Those who pile up enough points win T-shirts and bumper stickers, or even a trip to Iowa for primary day.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe app also captures the user’s contact list. It then matches the names up with names in the campaigns voter database. If the user has a friend in Des Moines, for example, the campaign may start sending emails asking the friend to attend a caucus or volunteer. To date, the app has been downloaded 37,000 times. Counting Delegates If the Trump campaign finds itself in a close and protracted race with Cruz in the primary, its lack of data could hurt it in other ways. Many of the presidential candidates are using their data and tools to manage long-term strategies that go well beyond the borders of single primary states. These strategies dictate which specific voter enclaves can be targeted in each state to yield the delegates the campaign needs to win. “It’s a race for delegate votes in states where it’s not winner take all,” Cambridge Analytica’s Oczkowski says. Oczkowski was chief digital officer for Wisconsin governor Scott Walker’s presidential bid. The end game of the primaries is to collect enough state delegates to earn the nomination. In some primary states–like Florida (99 delegates)- the candidate who wins the most votes takes all the delegate votes, which will be added up at the end of the primary process to land on the party’s nominee to run in the presidential race. Other states, like Iowa (30 delegates), award delegates proportionately to the number of votes the candidate wins in the state. The Cruz, Rubio, and Bush campaigns each will take a deep look at the delegate picture in every primary state that awards delegates proportionately. They’ll take a hard look at their voter data to pinpoint the voter enclaves in which they have a solid chance of grabbing delegates. This overall strategy can make a huge difference, especially in close races.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“Candidates who aren’t taking a scientific look at which pockets of delegates they can realistically compete for are naive,” Oczkowski says. “You start to see the difference when you look at the delegate allocations as we go past the first four states; there is a real science in how to do that.” The Short History Of Campaign Data The modern age of data-driven campaigning began in 2004 with the Howard Dean and George W. Bush campaigns for president. The Dean campaign was the first to use digital channels, mainly email, to reach voters. The Bush campaign was the first to bring in numerous demographics and political data, and use it at scale in a national campaign. “The GOP would conduct mega surveys—tens of thousands of respondents in a particular state (whereas a typical statewide poll in your average industrial state might have 500-800 respondents),” says Josh Zeitz of the ad tech powerhouse AppNexus. “They then overlaid consumer, credit, organizational membership, and financial data (widely available for purchase) to develop much more sophisticated voter models.” Zeitz was senior policy adviser to former Governor Jon Corzine of New Jersey. He’s also lectured on history at Harvard, Cambridge, and Brown. The Obama campaigns in 2008 and 2012 took it to a new level, both in content and scope, Zeitz says. The campaign integrated more types of data and used modeling software to determine the messaging and medium for communicating with individual voters. “When I started working on campaigns in the mid-’90s, you could, at best, target specific households within a precinct,” Zeitz says. “Now, you can be somewhat certain which people will respond to which messages.”\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn 2016, campaigns are analyzing and modeling voter types. They’re targeting and testing ads on smartphones. Some are working with cable services to target TV household by household. They have much better tools for tracking whether or not voters are reacting to, or interacting with, various forms of advertisement. “Instead of blanketing the airwaves or stuffing mailboxes, campaigns can be surgical about their outreach, engagement, and fundraising and build the coalition that gets them to 50+1 [a majority of votes],” Zeitz says. “It’s moneyball for politics.” Data Pools The Trump campaign’s disinterest in data could ultimately hurt the Republican party (even more than it already is). Any insider will tell you that the GOP has fallen well behind the Democrats when it comes to voter data. The Democratic party decided long ago that all the party campaigns would contribute the data they acquire or collect to a central pool, so that all state and federal candidates can benefit. The GOP announced that it intended to do the same thing, but competition and lack of integration among the major database providers (L2, i360, et al.) has hindered those plans. With Trump’s celebrity and appeal to new voter groups, his campaign could be gathering massive amounts of demographic and outreach data that could help other state- and federal-level GOP campaigns in the future. But he’s not.\n\nadvertisement\n\n“We’ve come so far, we’ve been chasing our tails for the past 10 years, but we’re just starting to catch up on data and now we have a front-runner who doesn’t care about any of it,” says GOP data and social media guru Vincent Harris of Harris Media. Harris, too, believes Trump’s earned media appeal and effectiveness on social media may not create enough of a bond between candidate and voter to bring about the wide margin of victory suggested by the polls today. “At the end of the day a lot of his support is wishy-washy and back and forth, based on the some comment he made,” Harris said. “I think his poll numbers are inflated, and it all comes down to what will actually turn people out to vote.” Harris points out that the Trump campaign doesn’t seem to want voters’ data, and it doesn’t want their money either. This is important, Harris explains, because donations often serve two purposes for a campaign–they pay for the cost of campaigning, but they also form a sort of handshake between voter and campaign. Harris points to studies showing that Iowans who have donated to a political campaign are likely to show up to caucus. Trump has volunteers knocking on doors in Iowa and New Hampshire like everyone else does, but for many voters the bond to the candidate, however compelling, might still be impersonal, consisting of viewing the candidate on television or from afar at a campaign rally. Of course nobody knows exactly how angry or committed Trump’s supporters are, and we’ll have to wait until February 1st to find out. If they come out in droves, the campaign’s data operation (or lack thereof) may be a moot point.\n\nadvertisement",

    "article_text": "A secretive data and technology company linked to conservative oil billionaires Charles and David Koch has reached an agreement to share its information with the “voter file and data management company” that holds an exclusive agreement with the Republican National Committee. This will allow the Republican Party full access to voter data collected by the Koch’s Freedom Partners entities and clients — and entrenches the Kochs’ network even deeper into the GOP.\n\nBecause political parties are not allowed to accept corporate contributions, it would be illegal for the Kochs to simply give their massive databases to the Republican National Committee directly. But the Republican National Committee has outsourced its database management to a company called GOP Data Trust. And that company joined forces Thursday with i360 (aka Themis), a firm reportedly backed by the Koch Brothers’ Freedom Partners and serving as repository for the data amassed by the Kochs’ political empire.\n\nIn a press release, the two companies claimed that the “historic data sharing partnership” will “allow Republican and Conservative campaign resources to be spent more efficiently than ever before.” They noted that “voter contact information gathered by clients of either The Data Trust or i360” will be now used by both to “improve the data shared with all clients,” meaning “conservative groups and campaigns will have more information about voters at their disposal for their own activities than ever before.”\n\nPaul S. Ryan, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, told ThinkProgress that as long as the Republican National Committee pays fair-market value to its data vendor, it does not matter who that vendor coordinates with. “Campaign finance laws only regulate the committees themselves, not other freestanding entities,” he explained.\n\nRyan noted that this sort of coordination is not necessarily exclusive to GOP entities — and that it can be a real challenge in determining what is a “fair” value for voter data. He pointed out that the super PAC ‘Ready for Hillary’ is collecting a great deal of information on pro-Clinton donors. That information “would be immensely valuable to Hillary Clinton, if she decides to run for president,” he explained, but probably “less valuable to another candidate.” And, in the end, it would up to the Federal Election Commission to determine whether the RNC or a theoretical Hillary Clinton campaign is paying a fair amount for that information.\n\nBut in a time when the lines between the Republican Party and the Kochs were already blurred, this deal is another indication that the anti-government billionaire activists are leading the party.\n\n(HT: Jon Ward)",

    "article_text": "He has a commanding lead in the polls, but Donald Trump is the only Republican presidential candidate who hasn’t purchased a database of voter information, which political campaigns use to target supporters and mobilize them on election day.\n\nModern campaigns also rely on voter files to plan everything from advertising to events, and accurate information is particularly key in the early state of Iowa, where voters will select a candidate in January through a complicated caucus process that gathers individuals in a room to make a group decision. Meticulous organization is seen as the key to victory.\n\nBut Trump’s campaign hadn’t purchased any voter information as of the end of September, according to financial disclosures analyzed by Quartz, and his campaign confirms that he is not using the national Republican party’s voter file.\n\nVoter databases are created from the electoral rolls of registered voters in a given county, but those records quickly become outdated as people move or pass away. They also don’t reflect which registered voters actually vote on a regular basis. Campaigns constantly update this information by canvassing neighborhoods and calling voters, then share it with national party organizations or private companies who attempt the keep the information as current and usable as possible.\n\nPolitical operatives from both parties said they didn’t know how Trump would turn out his supporters without a voter file.\n\n“The voter file is a foundational piece for any grassroots campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire,” Patrick Ruffini, a veteran GOP operative who founded digital agency Engage, told Quartz. “If Trump’s campaign were not using any voter file, even after being offered it by the RNC, that would be a pretty shocking statement.”\n\nThis year, the Republican National Committee, which is sharing data with two private firms, the GOP Data Trust and i360, has offered its voter file free-of-charge to all Republican primary candidates. According to Yahoo News, all of the contenders have taken them up on this offer except Trump, whose spokesperson told Quartz today that the campaign has not reached an agreement with the RNC. A committee spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOn the Democratic side, the two leading candidates—former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and senator Bernie Sanders—have purchased voter information from the Iowa and New Hampshire state Democratic parties, the two states with the earliest primary elections. Both campaigns also have contracts with NGP VAN, a firm that maintains voter databases for Democratic campaigns.\n\nTrump’s campaign says it has 10 staffers on the ground in Iowa and seven working in New Hampshire, but it isn’t clear how they are organizing their effort. While some aspects of Trump’s untraditional campaign—like running without a pollster or media consultants—speak to his unvarnished message and outsider appeal, a failure to do the basic blocking and tackling of finding voters may be a problem.\n\n“Flouting the rules and doing things the unconventional way has been Trump’s trademark so far in the campaign, but eventually this catches up to you,” Ruffini said. “Just think back to Newt Gingrich (and every other candidate save for Mitt Romney and Ron Paul) failing to qualify for the ballot in Virginia [in the 2012 presidential primary.] Eventually, the nomination battle becomes a state-by-state war for delegates, and that starts with being able to target voters.”\n\nEven if Trump’s lack of a voter file hurts him in Iowa, it may not spell the end of his campaign. Arizona Senator John McCain and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney handily sewed up the GOP nominations in 2008 and 2012, respectively, despite surprising losses in the Iowa caucuses to the one-time Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, who both deployed a network of well-organized evangelical voters.\n\nUltimately, no amount of organization can win the nomination for an unpopular candidate—and Trump, voter file or no, has popularity to spare.",

    "article_text": "This story has been updated.\n\nFor forty minutes on Wednesday (Dec. 16), a few staffers working on Bernie Sanders’ campaign accidentally stumbled onto a presidential campaign cheat code: A software glitch revealed information about people Hillary Clinton’s team expects to vote in the presidential primaries, and which candidate they are expected to support.\n\nThe consequences of the glitch—which originated with Democratic campaign vendor NGP-VAN—could prove devastating to Sanders.\n\nThe Democratic party has locked his campaign out of its central voter database until it can figure out exactly what happened, which could hamstring Sanders’ efforts to identify voters and get them to the polls when voting starts early next year. The Iowa caucuses, which kick off voting for the Democratic and Republican nominees, are less than seven weeks away.\n\n“It became clear that one of our staffers accessed some modeling data from another campaign,” Sanders’ campaign spokesperson told the New York Times. “That behavior is unacceptable and that staffer was immediately fired.”\n\nThe Sanders campaign is protesting the DNC’s decision to ban it from the database, promising to take the party to federal court today if it fails to reconsider the decision, with the campaign’s manager, Jeff Weaver, suggesting that party officials are trying to aid Clinton’s campaign. He also said he believed some of his campaign’s data was accessed during the breach.\n\nAccounts associated with two Sanders staffers reportedly accessed the Clinton data, officials for the Democratic National Committee told Quartz. The fired employee is Josh Uretsky, an experienced manager of voter databases who was hired to run the campaign’s data operation in September.\n\n“We investigated it for a short period of time to see the scope of the Sanders campaign’s exposure and then the breach was shut down, presumably by the vendor,” Uretsky told CNN. “We did not gain any material benefit.”\n\nBloomberg’s Jennifer Epstein reported, however, that the campaign created at least 24 lists from the Clinton data and saved them in personal folders, including information about groups of Clinton supporters in Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nThe information accessed by the Sanders campaign is the lifeblood of modern political campaigns. Both major parties in the US maintain a national voter database that enables campaigns to find voters, persuade them with targeted messages, and eventually bring them to the polls on election day.\n\nThe files require constant maintenance by campaigns as voters move, pass on or shift their allegiances. Each day, campaign organizers knock on doors or make phone calls to prospective voters, returning to enter the information into the database for campaign strategists to consider.\n\nLocal and state campaigns can rent the lists and contribute data they gather to the party’s overall effort. But primary battles introduce a set of skewed incentives and a more complicated system, where rival campaigns renting the data also rely on internal firewalls to keep one campaign’s modifications from being seen by another. Once a nominee is selected, the data is rolled back together into a single database.\n\nAmong Democrats, the primary vendor for this kind of work is NGP-VAN, a company that grew from the merger of the top voter database firm (Voter Activation Network) and the most popular company that operated online donation systems (NGP software).\n\nThe company’s president, Stu Trevelyan, told reporters that the glitch that made Clinton’s campaign data visible occurred during a routine update to the software, and an audit is underway. He said that Sanders’ staff would not have been able to save or export any data they saw.\n\nThe Democrats are seen to have an edge in campaign technology over the Republicans—personified in Clinton’s own extensive internal tech-team and venture capital-backed main software vendor—but this snafu is a reminder of the dangers in complacency. The Republican voter list is managed by two companies—the GOP Data Trust and i360—and shared with the Republican National Committee, which has provided it free of charge to all Republican campaigns. There have been no reports of GOP data breaches so far.\n\nFor now, Sanders’ data team will need to scramble to come up with an alternate system to keep their volunteers and staff at work. Ironically—and perhaps a positive sign for Sanders if his campaign remains blocked from Democratic data—is that the leading national contender for the Republican party, Donald Trump, has not yet bothered to obtain access to a voter database.",

Visit the online home of Playbook http://politi.co/2f51Jnf\n\nGood Thursday morning.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTHE REALITY -- ‘IT’S ALL UP TO THE WHITE HOUSE NOW’ -- The health-care bill is really down to a coin flip. The mood in the Capitol yesterday was tense -- not because people were worried about failure, but because the situation was so fluid it was difficult to get a real read on what was transpiring. Even the smartest and savviest vote counters had no idea whether they will be able to pass this bill to replace the Affordable Care Act. As of publishing time this morning, House Republicans planned to bring this bill to the floor Thursday no matter what the whip count looked like. We wouldn’t be surprised if the vote came after the market closed. (NOTE: Big thanks to John Bresnahan and the best-in-class POLITICO Hill team for keeping us honest and abreast of all twists and turns.)\n\nHERE’S THE DEAL. The conservative House Freedom Caucus -- which will meet with PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP this morning at 11:30 a.m. -- wants to not only eliminate coverage requirements for health insurers in the Obamacare bill (known as essential health benefits), but they also want to repeal the law’s Title One, which includes rules on coverage for pre-existing conditions and allowing children to remain on their parents’ plan up to age 26. As of early this morning, the leadership and White House were cool to that proposal.\n\n-- HFC SPOKESMAN ALYSSA FARAH (@Alyssafarah) at 11:12 p.m.: “No decisions reached. Continuing to negotiate. The Freedom Caucus continues to have serious concerns with current AHCA text.” Rep. Mark Meadows' statement http://bit.ly/2naGNNq\n\n**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/2lQswbh\n\nTHE NUMBERS. The dramatic changes to this bill throw the whip count in serious flux. House Republican leaders have now lost the support of moderates like Reps. Chris Smith and Frank LoBiando of New Jersey, Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania and David Young of Iowa. Watch for other moderate Republicans who see this as an opportunity to ditch the bill without major political consequence. There are 237 House Republicans and 215 need to vote yes to pass this bill. They can lose 22 lawmakers.\n\nTHE HYPOCRISY. Republicans are doing exactly what they accused Democrats of doing in 2010. They are rewriting this bill behind closed doors in the dead of night. They are using the powerful Rules Committee to give themselves remarkable authority to bring up and vote on any bill in the same day -- known, quite ominously, as “martial law.”\n\nTHE STAKES ...\n\n-- THE FREEDOM CAUCUS. To call this a critical moment for the House Freedom Caucus -- the clutch of conservative members in the House -- would be like calling Michael Jordan a weekend men’s league warrior. If the Freedom Caucus succeeds in getting the changes it wants and doesn’t put up the votes for the bill, their future negotiating stance will be seriously diminished. Even if they get half of what they want -- just eliminating essential health benefits -- and don’t put up some votes, it will be problematic in Trump’s eyes. But if they succeed here, they have the keys to the castle. If they get the changes they want, and help push this bill across the finish line, their negotiating tactics -- forcing changes at the last minute -- will be completely validated.\n\n-- PAUL RYAN. The House speaker crafted the legislative sequencing of 2017 -- health care repeal first and tax reform second. People close to Ryan know a defeat here will be a critical blow for the Wisconsin Republican, but they say that he cares little about his long-term political standing in the House, so he’s willing to get down and dirty. But there’s no doubt that not passing this bill would sow distrust in the West Wing, and put in doubt the leadership’s ability to shepherd the rest of the GOP’s agenda. A victory here would be big for Ryan -- at least in the short term.\n\n-- DONALD TRUMP. The president ran on being able to handle these situations better than anyone else. He always said that it was him, and him alone, who could close these deals. Remember? ‘We don’t make good deals anymore … Obamacare is a disaster -- I’ll take care of it.’ OK, well we’ll see today whether that’s true. At this point, it’s Trump versus a group of more than two dozen conservative lawmakers who have spent years stifling John Boehner and Paul Ryan. The GOP leadership is calling Trump ‘the closer’ -- a subtle nod to their belief that it’s his job to get this thing through. A loss here would throw that -- and Trump’s entire legislative agenda -- into question.\n\n-- THE AGENDA. Republicans have talked about repealing Obamacare for nearly a decade. If they can’t get it done, how can we expect tax reform to get done? Forget the silly August deadline that the New York wing of Trump’s White House is peddling. If they can’t get health care done in the House, where the GOP enjoys a large majority, how can they rewrite the incredibly complex tax code?\n\n-- DEMOCRATS are holding strong against the bill. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) can smell blood in the water. Expect to hear more about how Trumpcare will tax older Americans, provide less coverage and cost more. By the way, Pelosi dealt with similar dynamics in 2009 during Obamacare -- her liberals wanted a public health-insurance option. They promised to never vote for any bill without it. Over a few months, they systematically broke down.\n\n-- SOMETHING TO REMEMBER -- The last time Republicans owned something big on health care was in 2003 with President George W. Bush’s Medicare prescription drug bill. GOP leadership had to basically lock the doors and hold open the vote for hours to flip three or four holdouts. The political dynamics were far different back then. The GOP had a strong whip in Tom Delay, and they had goodies to dole out, like earmarks.\n\n-- THE REAL QUESTION. What is the Republican endgame here? They’ve made so many changes to the bill that nearly everyone concedes that, even if House Republicans pass it, it is basically dead on arrival in the Senate. It’s hard to remember a more consequential vote or issue where there wasn’t a long-term political strategy. Even if this somehow becomes law, it will almost certainly face issues in implementation. Republicans are coming up against the hard reality that voters want more health care for less cost, which is virtually impossible to deliver on.\n\nTHE LATEST -- “White House shift to right on health care angers moderates,” by Kyle Cheney, Rachael Bade and John Bresnahan. http://politi.co/2nfw99Q … “Inside Trump’s last-ditch bid to avoid a health care disaster,” by Rachael Bade, John Bresnahan and Kyle Cheney http://politi.co/2mTG1mh\n\n--“Is Trumpcare already here?” by Politico Pulse author Dan Diamond: “No matter what happens to the Republicans’ troubled health bill in Congress, Trumpcare is here to stay. The Trump administration has already begun to transform the health insurance market, wielding executive power to rewrite coverage rules, slash Obamacare’s marketing budget and signal an all-out assault on his predecessor’s health care law.

Their agony on health care is just beginning. For the past seven years, the party benefited from its powerlessness, which usefully maximized its ability to criticize Obamacare and minimized its responsibility to do anything about it. Now, with unified control of government, the party will pay the piper. Nothing good will come of the Obamacare repeal-and-replace debate. If anything resembling the current bill passes and is signed into law, Republicans will spend years trying to fix it and live it down. If the bill fails, the rest of President Donald Trump’s legislative agenda may sink with it.” http://politi.co/2nFNf1v\n\nTRUMP’S THURSDAY -- In addition to his meeting with the Freedom Caucus, Trump will have lunch with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and billionaire investment manager Nelson Peltz.

This is partly what FBI Director James Comey was referring to when he made a bombshell announcement Monday before Congress that the FBI is investigating the Trump campaign's ties to Russia, according to one source. The FBI is now reviewing that information, which includes human intelligence, travel, business and phone records and accounts of in-person meetings, according to those U.S. officials. The information is raising the suspicions of FBI counterintelligence investigators that the coordination may have taken place, though officials cautioned that the information was not conclusive and that the investigation is ongoing.” http://cnn.it/2ng62PZ\n\n-- “[Adam] Schiff: There is now ‘more than circumstantial evidence’ of Trump-Russia collusion,” by Madeline Conway: “‘I can tell you that the case is more than that,’ Schiff told Chuck Todd on MSNBC. ‘And I can’t go into the particulars, but there is more than circumstantial evidence now.’ When Todd followed up, asking if he had ‘seen direct evidence of collusion,’ Schiff would not say so directly, but insisted that he has seen some ‘evidence that is not circumstantial’ and is worth investigating.” http://politi.co/2mXmCl2\n\n--SPEAKING OF WHICH -- PLAYBOOK INBOX -- “A personal note from Roger Stone”: “I am anxious to rebut allegations that I had any improper or nefarious contact with any agent of the Russia State based on facts, not misleading and salacious headlines.

I have articles saying that it happened.”\n\n--On his unsubstantiated claim that 3 million undocumented immigrants voted illegally, Trump said he would be proved right eventually, though he hinted that he no longer stood by all parts of that claim, saying, “When I say that, mostly they register wrong. In other words, for the votes, they register incorrectly, and/ or illegally. I’m forming a committee on it.”\n\n-- On the risk to his reputation caused by saying false things, Trump said: “Hey, look, I can’t be doing so badly, because I’m President and you’re not. You know.

The lawmakers worry that Gorsuch could be confirmed whether Democrats try to block him or not -- and Democrats will be left with nothing to show for it. That would be a bitter pill after the GOP blocked Merrick Garland for nearly a year.\n\n“The deal Democrats would be most likely to pursue, the sources said, would be to allow confirmation of Gorsuch in exchange for a commitment from Republicans not to kill the filibuster for a subsequent vacancy during President Donald Trump’s term. The next high court opening could alter the balance of the court, and some Democrats privately argue that fight will be far more consequential than the current one.” http://politi.co/2mT7RPs\n\nBUT, BUT, BUT -- “Democrats Seize on Disability Ruling to Bolster Their Case Against Gorsuch,” by WSJ’s Jess Bravin: http://on.wsj.com/2mTFosC\n\nTHE JUICE …\n\n-- FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: LIZ ALLEN, former White House deputy communications director and deputy assistant to President Obama, is joining Glover Park Group as a senior vice president in the firm’s strategic communications practice.

[T]op aides have been looking at candidates inside and outside the agency who can improve its morale and regain the credibility lost after a string of embarrassing lapses. They hope to name a new director in the coming weeks. ... Critics of the agency have seized on the most recent cases to amplify calls for the White House to recruit a leader from outside the Secret Service, which would be unprecedented in the famously hidebound agency’s modern history. They insisted that only someone untethered from the agency’s ways of thinking could institute the kind of reforms necessary to guide the organization.” http://nyti.ms/2o7UID3\n\nTRUMP INC. -- “Trump’s early policy moves benefit the industries he knows best - his own,” by Darren Samuelsohn: “Donald Trump’s presidency has been good for business, with a soaring stock market, a freeze on new regulations and an Oval Office that appears to have an open door for CEOs. But Trump has been especially good news for the industries in which he has a personal interest: real estate, construction, entertainment, hospitality, gambling and, of course, golf. Since taking office in January, Trump has made moves -- from rolling back water quality permits to signaling big changes on overtime pay and internet betting -- that benefit the fields he knows best. And his former peers -- partners and competitors alike -- are finding familiar faces in Trump’s White House and Cabinet agencies, who have the power to make even more of their wish lists come true.” http://politi.co/2nFFicD\n\nLONDON ATTACK LATEST -- “Major raids conducted after London attack; 7 arrested,” by AP’s Frank Griffiths and Gregory Katz in London: “British police conducted major raids and arrested seven people in connection with the attack outside Parliament that left four dead, including the man who mowed down pedestrians on a bridge and fatally stabbed an officer, a senior police official said Thursday.

Mr. Trump, the oldest son of President Trump, was calling attention to an article from September in The Independent, a British newspaper, that described Mr. Khan’s reaction to a bombing then in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City. Mr. Trump mischaracterized the London mayor’s remarks. Mr. Khan did not describe terrorism as ‘part of living in a big city,’ as if bombings and shootings were an inescapable fact of life. He said that terrorism preparedness, including providing sufficient support to the police, was ‘part and parcel of living in a great global city.’” http://nyti.ms/2nqrSk3\n\nCOMING ATTRACTIONS -- “Trump meets Black Caucus and vows action on drug prices,” by Elana Schor and Matt Nussbaum: “President Donald Trump had a ‘candid’ discussion with members of the Congressional Black Caucus Wednesday, lawmakers said, while also repeating his politically-challenging campaign promise to tackle high prescription drug prices. … ‘I think we’re going to do it in health care, or we’re going to do it separately, but we’re going to bid down drug prices, and we’re going to try to have the lowest prices anywhere in the world from really the highest,’ Trump told the lawmakers, according to a pool report.” http://politi.co/2nUyMMv\n\nHOT TAKE -- DANA MILBANK in WaPo, “Lincoln was a Republican, slavery is bad — and more discoveries by President Obvious”: “Seeking and winning the presidency has been a magical voyage of discovery for Donald Trump.

He has repeatedly tried to educate the populace on this little-known fact. August 2016: ‘Most people don’t know this. The Republican Party is ... the party of Abraham Lincoln.’ September 2016: ‘A lot of people don’t realize that Abraham Lincoln, the great Abraham Lincoln, was a Republican.’ October 2016: ‘A lot of people don’t know that it’s the party of Abraham Lincoln.’” http://wapo.st/2naeZJ7\n\n****** A message from PhRMA: For more than 10 years, Medicare has provided prescription drug coverage for seniors.

Forty-six percent of Californians approve of the job Harris is doing, while 23 percent disapprove, according to a poll released late Wednesday by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California.

The charges, if filed, would target alleged Chinese middlemen who prosecutors believe helped North Korea orchestrate the theft ...

Parts suppliers in the American South compete for low-margin orders against suppliers in Mexico and Asia. They promise delivery schedules they can’t possibly meet and face ruinous penalties if they fall short. Employees work ungodly hours, six or seven days a week, for months on end.

They say the stories are adding to tensions between career staffers and political appointees as they begin to implement Trump’s agenda, and they worry that the stories could inspire Trump to try purging federal agencies of perceived enemies. The claims posted on the conservative sites include allegations of anti-Israel and pro-Iran bias against staffers at institutions such as the State Department and the National Security Council.

    "article_text": "It is an election year. If you will recall, at TechRepublic and ZDNet in 2016, we tracked not the horse race, but the data and technology that powers politics. Why? Because there's a ton of information private industry and other institutions, like academics and NGOs, can get from learning how politics use and doesn't use data.\n\nTechRepublic met with Paul Westcott, vice president of data at L2 Political, one of the largest data vendors in politics. The political world is its own world, and for those who don't know about how politics and data are working together, tell me a little bit about what L2 does.\n\nWestcott: L2 is the longest serving, over 43 years, and largest non-partisan data processing firm. So that means we bring in all 50 states, Washington, D.C. voter files, country level voter files for multiple states, process those, put them into a uniform format, and then make them available for different elections, various academic organizations, as you mentioned, non-profits, a whole wide range of people who can actually have legal access to the voter file.\n\nAnd on top of that, what we're able to do is add in consumer-based information, predictive models, phone number, and outreach information, such as email, Facebook, Twitter handles, all that good stuff. So campaigns are able to speak more targeted to individual voters or academics are able to do the research they need to do.\n\nPatterson: And when you say \"target individual voters,\" you're not being hyperbolic or exaggerating. When I log into L2, I'm confronted with an overwhelming amount of information that is incredibly granular. Paul, tell me what you can see about a voter and about voters grouped together and what those groups are.\n\nWestcott: What voter mapping does in the platform you were working in, essentially it takes the voter file, which is a giant either text or CSV file, a giant fire hose of data essentially that is almost unusable, especially if you're a small or shoestring-type organization or campaign. And what we do is we put everything into really simple, selectable, different selections on the right-hand side of this mapping platform.\n\nAnd what you see when you open up voter mapping is you can select by party identification. You can look into vote history and registration date, those kind of standards of the voter file. But beyond there, you can go into consumer information, income, education level, census data based on unemployment rates in different areas. You can look at donor information, both from the Federal Election Commission file, as well as private donor file that we obtain from various third-party sources.\n\nSo we're bringing in data from all kinds of different places to be able to put it together in a really usable and visually-friendly-type format.\n\nSubscribe to TechRepublic's Big Data Essentials newsletter.

    "article_text": "When New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner said he intended to share information from the state’s public voter checklists with a newly launched Trump administration commission, plenty of people were quick to decry the move as an “invasion of privacy.”\n\nBut this debate over the decision to turn over voter data to the Trump commission has also highlighted a gap in public awareness around the state’s elections: A lot of people don’t seem to realize this same information is already being bought and sold and shared on a regular basis, all thanks to a law that gives political parties and committees the ability to buy batches of voter data from the Secretary of State.\n\nIf you’ve voted in any New Hampshire election in the last decade, some of your information has likely already been shared with a number of political groups, some rooted in New Hampshire, others whose only tie to the state is a signature from a willing resident on the political committee registration form.\n\nThanks to a law passed in 2007, any organization registered as a political party or a political committee is allowed to buy copies of the statewide voter checklist, which contain the same kind of information Secretary of State Bill Gardner is now planning to hand over to the Trump administration: voter names, mailing addresses, domicile addresses, party affiliations and voting history. The campaigns then combine that data with other data sets and use it to “microtarget” voters with mailers, phone calls and other tools of modern campaigns.\n\nWhile the same information is technically “public” for anyone to view, the privilege of copying and sharing that data isn’t available to the average New Hampshire resident. Instead, members of the public who want their own up-to-date versions of the voter checklists would have to purchase local versions from each individual town.\n\nThis provision is part of the reason why people are objecting to Gardner's plans to share the data with the Trump commission in the first place. Opponents point out that the law has specific criteria for what kind of groups can buy copies of the statewide checklist, and a presidential commission isn't one of them.\n\nSince New Hampshire started offering its voter checklist to political groups, records provided by the Secretary of State’s office show that these files have been an especially hot commodity for national political data firms.\n\nOne Washington-based company that bills itself as “the data utility powering the progressive community” has accounted for more than a quarter of all New Hampshire checklist sales since 2008. According to its website, Catalist “compiles, enhances, stores, and dynamically updates data on over 240 million unique voting-age individuals across all 50 states and the District of Columbia.”\n\nAs part of that mission, they’ve spent more than $190,000 on nearly two dozen copies of New Hampshire voter files.\n\nThree other entities, “Independent Data,” “Free State Data” and “Granite State Freedom PAC,” have each spent about $49,000 on their own copies of the checklist.\n\nThe person listed as the chairman on the paperwork for both Independent Data and Free State Data is Michael Palmer, who TIME once profiled as “the Koch Brothers’ Data Guru.”\n\nPalmer is behind the Virginia-based data firm i360, which boasts on its website that it maintains “1800 unique data points” on “199 million active voters” to give clients “the full picture of who they are, where they live, what they do and what is happening around them.”\n\nGranite State Freedom PAC has ties to another out-of-state data firm, L2 Political, which is based in Washington state and claims it’s “the country’s leading provider of high quality enhanced voter data and customized data processing.”\n\nOn a more local level, state political parties have also been frequent buyers of these checklists.\n\nThe New Hampshire Republican Party has spent more than $148,000 on 18 copies of updated voter files over the years, purchasing a new one as recently as June 5. The New Hampshire Democratic Party has spent more than $99,000 on 12 copies of the voter file through the years, buying its most recent version on April 6.\n\nCandidates for state office are also allowed to buy copies of the checklist information for their district.\n\nLast year, Congressional District Candidate Shawn O’Connor purchased a copy of the voter file for the First Congressional District for $3,215 from the state.\n\nAnd if voters are unhappy to learn their information is already being traded in this way, there’s not much they can do about it.\n\n“There is no provision in state statute for a voter to “opt out” of having their name appear on the checklist,” Deputy Secretary of State Dave Scanlan said Monday. “Names are removed from the checklist due to death, moving out of a town or ward, conviction of a felony offense or not voting in an election for at least two election cycles after proper notification.”\n\nSo for now, if you’d at least like to learn more about what kind of groups might be holding onto this information already, check out the data (provided by the Secretary of State’s office) below.",

I'm an expert, and I don't know what these numbers just told you.\n\nJosh: Numbers don't lie.\n\nJoey: They lie all the time.\n\nNumbers lie all the time. Yet the business of numbers is big business. Big data helps companies make better decisions by extracting key insights from piles of information. Polling does the same for politics.\n\nAnd like big data for business, though results can be ambiguous and notoriously hard to interpret, polls are essential tools for political campaigns. When pundits and politicos talk about \"the polls,\" they're referring to a bevy of companies and universities that perform specialized research.\n\nModern political polls are generally conducted through telephone surveys that target population samples based on demographic and psychographic criteria. Poll recipients are run through a barrage of carefully worded questions about personalities, messaging, and policy. Political data site RealClearPolitics publishes a question example.\n\nREAD: The case for building a collaborative organization (Tech Pro Research story)\n\nQuality polls use random sampling to determine who is called. Random digit dialing, a widely used tactic, is based on manual selection of the area code and phone number prefix, then picks the last four digits of a phone number at random. This tactics is great at getting usable local responses to questions, but bad because it doesn't exclude business, Skype, and other non-human numbers.\n\nRegistration-based sampling, another common polling method, is based on available data, usually voter registration lists and other data provided by the party. These polls can be less expensive, because voter data is already captured.\n\nTracking, policy, benchmark, and opinion polls are often commissioned by campaigns digging for information about voter segments. The final product, presented to the campaign or client, is typically a document that breaks down recipient responses by age, gender, location, income, and political association.\n\nBig data played a major role in informing the Ted Cruz campaign who to microtarget and poll during the primaries. Computers are prohibited from calling cell phones, but humans can manually dial numbers from spreadsheets generated by computers.\n\nAre polls accurate? Poll results can seem inconsistent because the business of polling is diverse. Gallop, a respected data firm that provides deep analytics to large organizations, routinely publishes a survey on its election polling accuracy.\n\nData site FiveThirtyEight tracks the accuracy of dozens of polling agencies, ranging from local regional specialists to national firms and large research universities. While accuracy depends on the type of poll and the agency conducting poll research, political polls have been fairly accurate.\n\nA Bloomberg survey seems to confirm that, during 2016 political cycle campaign, polls have been reliable. Bloomberg used RealClearPolitics aggregate polling data in a month-long survey during the primaries, which showed that 86 percent of polls accurately forecast election winners.\n\nREAD: 2016 by the numbers: Should Donald Trump be winning? (CBS News)\n\nElection Tech Visualizing the Russian cyberattack Cybersecurity experts explain how the data breach happened, and Twitter chatter reveals what competing social media factions are saying about the election hack. Read more\n\nThough polls have been accurate this cycle, the industry appears to be in a period of transition. Mobile devices have had a significant impact on poll response rates. Because many polls are conducted over the phone, consumers are more able to block or dismiss unknown calls. A Vanderbilt survey found that response rates to robocalls are abysmal.\n\nBig data companies are hungry for policial dollars and attempting to augment or supplant polling data with web and mobile user data. During the recent Republican National Convention, several polling experts indicated that the polling and big data industries could someday merge. A number of private data companies—Cambridge Analytica, Wilson Perkins Allen Research, L2 Political—already provide campaigns with mission critical data. Several political data companies see politics as a stepping-stone to other industries. After the general election, Cambridge Analytica intends to apply its personality modeling data research to the financial services, advertising, and healthcare industries. \"We chose [politics] because those candidates were the best way to enter the market,\" said CEO Alexander Nix.\n\nBecause of the broad range of polling agencies, using polls to track the general election can be challenging.

    "article_text": "Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign has ramped up its aggressive voter-targeting operation, paying out more than $3m to a company that – along with parallel funding via Super Pacs linked to the senator’s top donor – is using detailed psychological profiles to sway voters.\n\nIowa caucus day: Palin praises Trump as 'he who will be the next president' – campaign live Read more\n\nA Guardian analysis of the final campaign disclosures released on the eve of Iowa’s caucuses shows the Cruz campaign, banking on a win in the first-in-the-nation voting state, significantly outspent his main Republican rivals in targeting potential voters online during the final quarter of 2015.\n\nDuring this period, Cruz surged in the polls and emerged as a frontrunner from the crowded Republican race in Iowa as attack ads rained down on Donald Trump and Marco Rubio. Trump went on to regain his lead ahead of Monday night’s Iowa caucuses. Over the weekend, the Cruz campaign came under fire separately for mailing accusations of a “voting violation” to individual Iowa residents amid what privacy and transparency experts said had amounted to “a military escalation” of data-driven campaigning.\n\nThe federally mandated release of expenditure filings on Sunday shows a crescendo of spending as well-funded campaigns and their allied Super Pacs bolster their digital firepower by pouring record amounts of cash into the so-called “micro-targeting” of voters across social media with increasingly personal ads.\n\nCruz has deepened his ties to the little-known data analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, directing around 20% of overall spending during the reporting period to the data scientists embedded at Cruz’s campaign headquarters in Houston.\n\nTed Cruz campaign using firm that harvested data on millions of unwitting Facebook users Read more\n\nIn December, the Guardian uncovered long-standing privacy and ethical issues around the way Cambridge Analytica’s parent company had acquired detailed psychological data on tens of millions of voters using data harvested from largely unwitting Facebook users.\n\nCambridge Analytica is understood to be financed by hedge-fund magnate Robert Mercer, who is also the leading individual donor to the Cruz campaign. Last year, the influential but reclusive Wall Street executive channeled $11m into the pro-Cruz Super Pac Keep the Promise I.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Mercer has taken an ‘unusually active role for a major donor’, says a campaign transparency watchdog. Photograph: ddp USA/Rex Shutterstock\n\nThe Mercer-backed group is part of a cluster of pro-Cruz Super Pacs, which all use a variation of the name Keep the Promise. In recent weeks Cambridge Analytica appears to have played a key role in a digital advertising blitzkrieg, funded by the web of Super Pacs that support Cruz.\n\nAccording to so-called “independent expenditure” reports, the Mercer-backed group, Keep the Promise I, has paid out almost $350,000 to Cambridge Analytica since mid-November. The records state the firm provided unspecified “media” in order to support Cruz and attack rival candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump.\n\nWhile the Keep the Promise Super Pacs officially exist as separate entities, the groups work together and keep in touch with weekly strategy calls, according to the Washington Post. In the two weeks leading up to the Iowa caucus, the Super Pacs spent $1.1m on online campaigning and advertising.\n\nThe involvement with Cambridge Analytica by both the Cruz campaign and an allied Super Pac appears to contrast with a decision made by Jeb Bush’s campaign last year to halt plans which would have seen the candidate share a data analytics company with the pro-Bush group, Right to Rise.\n\nIn October, the Associated Press reported the Bush campaign halted the plan over concerns around potentially crossing the line of coordination. Even after the 2010 US supreme court decision that allowed unlimited outside funding, candidates’ campaigns and Super Pacs are prohibited from coordinating political activities and must maintain separate operations.\n\nRichard Skinner, a policy analyst at transparency watchdog the Sunlight Foundation, said shared vendors are traditionally one of the “red flags” when detecting coordination between a campaign and an outside group.\n\nAsked to examine the relationships stemming from Cruz’s data-centric operations, Skinner said the campaign and Super Pac are not simply sharing a company that manufacturers campaign T-shirts, but a company that is providing an essential service to both.\n\n“The data is clearly pretty central to the campaign and presumably central to what the Super Pac is doing,” Skinner said in a phone interview on Monday, adding that Mercer had taken an “unusually active role for a major donor” in Cruz campaign operations.\n\nIn an email, Cambridge Analytica’s CEO Alexander Nix said his company treats compliance with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) rules as an “utmost priority”. He added: “With this in mind we have strict fire-walling procedures in place wherein the staff, data, and systems for each campaign are physically and electronically separated.”\n\nA spokesman for Mercer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBig data, bigger spending on Trump hats\n\nThe latest federal disclosures suggest the Cruz campaign is relying heavily on Cambridge Analytica as a pillar of his campaign operation, spending $3,055,990.95 from October through December. “We have a very successful relationship,” Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told the Guardian in December, adding that information was acquired legally. “They’re a great company, they provide us great data, and it helps us be highly effective in communicating with our voters.” (Tyler and a campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this article.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cruz campaign expenditures on the data firm Cambridge Analytica. Photograph: Screenshot: ProPublica Campaign Finance API\n\nSo far, other Republican candidates have spent considerably less on comparable data firms and digital-focused political consultants.\n\nOf the $1.3m Rubio’s campaign spent during the final quarter of 2015 on digital campaigning – or what on the campaign trail is known as “digital, data and analytics” – the largest sum of around $460,000 went to Optimus Consulting, a relatively small data analytics firm which has an established relationship with the Florida senator’s campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump spent more on hats than he did on data analytics. In early November, his campaign paid $235,000 to L2 Political, a minor Washington-based voter targeting and analytics outfit which focuses on political clients.\n\nOverall, Bush’s campaign spent around $800,000 on the digital campaign trail, over half of which went to Deep Root Analytics, a firm co-founded by former Mitt Romney data scientist Alex Lundry, who also serves as the Bush campaign’s director of analytics.\n\n‘Violations’ – and a war for targeting\n\nIn the final hours ahead of the 2016 campaign’s first vote, which was set to begin in Iowa on Monday evening, the Cruz campaign was condemned from all sides for applying its newfound targeting prowess to old-fashioned voter outreach.\n\nOn Friday, it emerged the campaign had sent official-looking direct mail to some voters accusing them of a “voting violation”. The mailer, which did not involve Cambridge Analytica, used so-called “social pressure” techniques and calculated a fake score for each target voter, along with their neighbors, according to their participation in recent elections.\n\nResponding to the controversy on Saturday night, Cruz was bullish. “I apologize to nobody for using every tool we can to encourage Iowa voters to come out and vote,” he told a press conference in Sioux City.\n\nExperts in modern-day election outreach said the mail episode, taken together with big-money online profiling, showed the Cruz campaign’s expertise in using psychological methods to pressure individuals into voting.\n\nDavid Peterson, a professor of political science at Iowa State University, appreciated that Cruz is trying to run a “smart and advanced” campaign by drawing on psychological techniques and academic research, but claimed the mailer had crossed a line.\n\n“We know candidates and campaigns mislead people all the time about themselves and their opponents,” he said. “But it’s the misleading about private citizens who have no connection to any of this that strikes me as particularly galling, and that’s what’s a step too far.”\n\nHow Facebook tracks and profits from voters in a $10bn US election Read more\n\nIn recent years, a wide body of academic research has found “social pressure” is often highly effective in increasing turnout – the key blockage in the senator’s path to overtaking Trump’s poll lead at the caucuses.\n\n“Just by gently signalling that people are watching you has been shown to increase participation,” said Eitan Hersh, a political scientist at Yale University who focuses on voter attitudes and campaign strategy.\n\nJoseph Turow, a leading data privacy expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that as the 2016 primary votes arrived, political analysts had seen an “upward trajectory” in data-driven campaigns targeting voters across devices and in specific moments.\n\n“Essentially it’s a military escalation because every group and every competitor is trying to outdo the other,” he said in an interview ahead of Sunday’s federally mandated filings.",

    "article_text": "Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\n\"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.\"\n\nBenjamin Disraeli\n\nA bitter cold wind whipped the proud flag around a pole as steely gray as the New Hampshire winter sky. \"He can't win,\" she said on condition of anonymity, \"because his big data is nonexistent. Has no ground game. He has no get-out-the-vote operation.\" As canvassers and candidates trudged through the snow, we chatted in a cozy Manchester diner, anxiously waiting for early primary results to roll in. Republicans had learned from their previous data-driven defeats, and candidates like John Kasich, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, and Jeb Bush all invested heavily in big data, explained the respected DC insider. She was confident that tech was going to win the primary, and presidency.\n\nShe was wrong. And so was everyone else.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign—on the trail from at early primaries, to debates, the RNC and DNC, through election day—TechRepublic reported on the emerging power of technologies to win elections. Ted Cruz's campaign, powered by information tech created by UK firm Cambridge Analytica, attributed its success in Iowa to microtargeting backed by big data. The Clinton campaign benefitted from the remnants of Obama's tech infrastructure and had a robust data and social media operation powered by prominent Silicon Valley technologists. The big winner was sure to be big data.\n\nEven the Trump campaign was prepared for a loss. On Election Day Trump headquarters in Manhattan was inaccessible, barricaded by a wall of trucks and protesters. As Bloomberg's Sasha Issenberg reported, Trump had a smart social media team but spent little on data, and even less on GOTV. The Republican nominee's grassroots support and social media strength, powered largely by robots and spammers, was also dubious.\n\nImage: Dan Patterson\n\nThe mood was jubilant and celebratory at Clinton's rally across town. During the day supporters traded smiles and hugs. Then the grim results rolled in.\n\n\"How could the polls be so wrong? How could our own data be so wrong?\" Standing in a discreet corner under the blue-tinted glass ceiling of New York's Javits center the Clinton staffer choked up. Superficially, it appeared that technology, the polls, and big data failed the Clinton campaign.\n\nAnd they weren't alone. Clinton's brutal loss hurt the polling industry, the data business, and the media. For weeks prior to the election, polls and prognosticators at respected news outlets like FiveThirtyEight and the New York Times all had Clinton ahead. After the election, pundits and the media offered several explanations: an over-confidence in data precision, inaccuracies in polling samples, and unmeasurable factors like voter sentiment.\n\n\"Perhaps people told pollsters one thing, but voted differently. People change their minds over time. It's human,\" said political scientist and TechRepublic data partner William P. Stodden. \"The tl;dr answer to why pollsters got it wrong,\" was, he explained, \"garbage in, garbage out. We can't poll the heart.\"\n\nSEE: Data storage: Preferred vendors, demands, challenges (Tech Pro Research report)\n\nAnd yet, undoubtedly, the 2016 election was the most high-tech campaign in history, and future candidates are likely to invest heavily in big data, social media, artificial intelligence, and other innovations. TechRepublic's Jason Hiner reports that social media played a critical role in engaging voters on both the left and right and helped raise funds for grassroots insurgents like Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\nImage: Dan Patterson\n\nIn many ways, campaigns are early adopters that blaze tech trails followed by enterprise companies and SMBs. Firms like L2 Political and Cambridge Analytica provide powerful insight about consumer demographics, TargetedVictory, incubated by the GOP and Romney campaign, helps companies automate advertising and marketing, liberal-leaning NGP VAN uses mobile devices to mobilize voters and consumers, and NationBuilder helps companies and campaigns better understand social media users.\n\nSo why did big data get it wrong (and right) on election night? TechRepublic asked political and technology experts to explain the failure and successes of big data.\n\n\"The lesson to learn is that the data didn't fail. Perhaps polling needs to be more complex and more robust. But our data didn't fail, obviously. A lot of people are saying polling is wrong. But we used polling data to help inform our models. We had a robust polling platform that did show a difficult battle. Our polling showed him down or even in battleground states, and the path to victory looked difficult. But what happens if turnout is different than expected? One of the clear outcomes was if the rural vote turned out, and the African American does not, the race gets closer and winnable. Because we were the underdog, we adjusted our model based on those factors. We saw this two weeks to a month out. We saw early votes and absentee trends that suggested an increase in rural voters, especially in Florida, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. We advised [that the Trump campaign] allocate time and resources to those states.\"\n\nDr. David Wilkinson, lead data scientist at Trump's data firm Cambridge Analytica\n\n\"It's not about the data. It's what you do with it ... did Clinton even have a real GOTV in Michigan, for example?\"\n\nJoe Trippi, former Howard Dean campaign manager\n\nWATCH: Who could be Donald Trump's chief of staff and who could be in his Cabinet? (CBS News)\n\n\"The election speaks to the power of brand loyalty. Once you bought into Donald Trump, you were unlikely to be moved. Maybe we didn't fully understand the sentiment of how voters felt. The race was so divided that if anyone said anything positive about either candidate they were attacked [on social media]. Those who were fully onboard with a campaign were not shy, but many went quiet and stopped participating. Data can't predict silence.\"\n\nDavid Almacy, former White House Internet Director for the George W. Bush administration\n\n\"Success has many parents and by next week we're going to be hearing that the Trump data team was perfect and exactly predicted the win and that he had a huge GOTV effort that no one bothered to cover. Everyone who knows, knows neither of those are true but that's the way it goes. What pollsters missed, really, was two things: They missed the Trump vote in rural areas was as big as it is [and] they missed the Trump shift in blue collar suburbs. This is probably a sampling issue. A traditional statewide poll might have a margin of error of 10 points for the rural part of the state because urban and suburban areas take up so much of the sample. I do think there were some 'shy Trump' voters, particularly in more affluent Republican suburbs. It's probably a smaller story than the rural vote or the blue-collar suburban vote, but if you look at the high number of undecideds in late polling and then compare it to the final tallies you either had a really late break for Trump, or some number of voters who said they were undecided but picked Trump ... analytics is going to be critical for cobbling together winning coalitions at all levels.\"\n\nChris Wilson, CEO Perkins Allen Opinion Research\n\nKeep current with companies at the intersection of data and policy, and subscribe now for free to the TechRepublic Big Data Analytics newsletter.

    "article_text": "Image: Getty Images\n\nThis article was originally published on CNET.\n\nBig Data was a big part of the first big debate.\n\nHillary Clinton and Donald Trump battled it out Monday night at Long Island's Hofstra University in the first of their three debates as they race to become the next US president. The candidates sparred over \"America's direction,\" \"achieving prosperity\" and \"securing America\" — basically anything — in a debate that was expected to draw an audience on par with the Super Bowl.\n\nWhile Trump said during the spirited debate he has the \"winning temperament\" to be president, he claimed his Democratic rival doesn't have the \"stamina\" for the position. Clinton fired back in many different ways, saying the Republican candidate wasn't prepared to debate and isn't qualified to be commander in chief.\n\nSEE: Clinton v. Trump: Where they stand on 7 top tech issues\n\n\"You know what else I'm prepared for? I'm prepared to be president,\" Clinton said. \"And that's a good thing.\"\n\nWith the race in a virtual dead heat, the debate provoked an outpouring of political expression on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other social media. With that expectation, Clinton's team recently sent supporters an email asking them to \"advocate on every online platform on the night she goes head to head with Trump.\" Meanwhile, Trump bought a Snapchat filter.\n\nBut the flood of data from social media reaction from the debate will likely paint a better picture, generating compelling and instantly useful information for campaigns. Companies like Fastly, L2 Political, Cambridge Analytica, NationBuilder, NGP VAN and TargetedVictory extract signals from piles of big data scraped from the social web, particularly Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Both campaigns employ internal teams that process these signals, using the data to shape messaging and their get-out-the-vote strategies.\n\n\"A lot of people are looking at this campaign, socially speaking, and want to compare this to the 2012 and 2008 [presidential] races,\" said Kellan Terry, a data analyst for Brandwatch, which measures social media reaction. \"But there's really not one to be made. All conventional wisdom is gone.\"\n\nWATCH: Like 2016 campaign, first presidential debate defied conventional patterns (CBS News)\n\nFastly said it saw a spike of 1.5 million requests per second, an increase of 3,000 percent, in media sites with fact checkers when Clinton referenced her own website and its fact checkers while she criticized Trump for alleged inaccuracies about jobs and taxes. Social media also saw a 25 percent increase when Clinton dissed Trump's tax policies calling them, \"Trumped-Up trickle down\" economics, which became the hashtag #TrumpedUpTrickleDown and began trending early on Twitter, Fastly added.\n\nOther popular trending terms on Twitter included \"#debatenight\" with 2.4 million tweets, \"Donald Trump,\" with more than 2.1 million, \"President\" (1.1 million) and \"The Donald\" (1 million). \"Fact check\" also resonated with users, registering more than 326,000 tweets.\n\nSocial intelligence company Sysomos discovered similar results by scraping Twitter in real time during and immediately following the debate. Its tool scrapes the social web, then applies Boolean searches — complex conditional queries — to suss trending content.\n\nHere were the top trending quotes from the debate on Twitter, by each candidate by the numbers, according to Sysomos:\n\nClinton\n\nTotal mentions: 1,321,073\n\nMost retweeted: https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/statuses/780577643456565248.\n\nTrump\n\nTotal mentions: 1,707,617\n\nMost retweeted: https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/statuses/780577456080166912.\n\nThese were the top trending quotes from the debate on Twitter, by candidate:\n\nClinton\n\n1. \"Trumped up, trickle down,\" with 23,436 total mentions.\n\n2. \"I know you live in your own reality,\" 26,668 total mentions.\n\n3. \"Maybe he's not as rich as he says he is,\" 3,508 total mentions.\n\nTrump\n\n1. \"Hillary Clinton has been fighting ISIS her entire adult life,\" with 31,557 total mentions.\n\n2. \"Braggadocious,\" with 14,040 total mentions.\n\n3. \"Stop and frisk,\" 83,436 total mentions.\n\n4. \"Good temperament,\" 9,741 total mentions.\n\nNon-candidate trending topics:\n\nLester Holt\n\nTotal mentions: 254,657\n\nMost retweeted: https://twitter.com/DanaSchwartzzz/statuses/780219640744120321\n\nTrump's health: Sniffles, sickness\n\nTotal mentions: 39,989\n\nMost retweeted: https://twitter.com/tyleroakley/statuses/780577076524888065\n\nDebate hashtags. | Image: Sysomos\n\nWhile he may not have fared well during the debate, Trump, whose Twitter handle is @realDonaldTrump, dominated the Twitter talk during the 90 minute-long clash. He captured 62 percent of the debate share of conversation on the social network compared with the 38 percent held by Clinton, whose Twitter handle is @HillaryClinton.\n\nSEE: Best practices for using social media in business (Tech Pro Research report)\n\nTechRepublic worked with data firm Datameer to generate sentiment analysis, a reflection of how social media users felt about the debate:\n\nSentiment level for both candidates: Clinton: 47, Trump: 45.\n\nPositive and negative terms: Clinton (Neg: 5495, Pos: 4876), Trump (Neg: 3444, Pos: 2762)\n\nTop hashtags in descending order: #debatenight, #debates2016, #imwithher, #trump, #debates, #maga, #nevertrump, #neverhillary\n\nTop metions in descending order: @foxnews, @potus, @cnn, @mcuban, @seanhannity, @msnbc, @barackobama, @kellyannepolls\n\nMost engaged states in descending order: CA, FL, NY, TX, IL, NJ\n\nDebate sentiment analysis of social media data. | Image: Datameer\n\nBig data company OpenText shared social media debate trends with TechRepublic.\n\nElection Tracker Trends: Pre-Debate (pulled Friday, September 23)\n\nIn the last 72 hours, the top news outlets wrote 3,735 stories that discuss the election and candidates. Approximately 62% of those stories had a negative tone, according to the sentiment analysis tool, and 29% were positive. \"New York\" was the most popular state keyword mentioned by media companies, and 'school,' 'price,' and 'tax' were the top trending topics. In the top online news outlets, Donald Trump leads in mentions with 1,108 mentions compared to Hilary Clinton's 870 media mentions. If you compare Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump in election coverage from the top online news sites in the previous 72 hours, Donald Trump received more negative mentions than Hilary (31% negative mentions for Trump vs. 23% negative mentions for Clinton). In the last 72 hours, Hillary Clinton's most popular topics by media mention were (in order) Foreign Policy, Campaign Finance and Terrorism. Donald Trump's most popular topics were (in order) Terrorism, Foreign Policy and Armed Forces.\n\nElection Tracker Trends: Post-Debate (pulled Tuesday, September 27)\n\nIn the last 72 hours, the top news outlets wrote 2,595 stories that discuss the election and candidates. Approximately 58% of those stories had a negative tone, according to the sentiment analysis tool, and 31% were positive. \"New York\" was the most popular state keyword mentioned by media companies, and 'presidential,' 'tax,' and 'crime' were the top trending topics. In the top online news outlets, Donald Trump leads in mentions with 1,109 compared to a very close Hillary Clinton's 1,031 media mentions. If you compare Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump in election coverage from the top online news sites in the previous 72 hours, Donald Trump received more negative mentions than Hilary (27% negative mentions for Trump vs. 22% negative mentions for Clinton). In the last 72 hours, Hillary Clinton's most popular topics by media mention were (in order) Foreign Policy, Terrorism and Campaign Finance. Donald Trump's most popular topics were (in order) Foreign policy, Terrorism and Campaign Finances.\n\nThe effect of real-time social media on the debates is still being measured, said Dan Franklin, a political science professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta.\n\nThat's because, according to Brandwatch's Terry, the candidates are on a stage under bright lights, unaware of how their sentiment is playing on social media and whether it will lead to a positive or negative trend and a hashtag.\n\n\"They won't benefit immediately from the social analysis, but they surely will review it later,\" he said. \"They will get to see for themselves and say, 'In this moment I did very well,' and 'This is something I need to work on.'\"\n\nFranklin agrees, using football terminology to further the point.\n\n\"There will be no 'Hail Mary's' or 'running out the clock,' at least for now,\" Franklin said. \"However, in the future, it might be useful for candidates to think in those terms.\"\n\nCNET freelancer Eric Mack contributed to this report.\n\nKeep current with companies at the intersection of tech and the 2016 US elections, and subscribe now for free to the TechRepublic Election Tech newsletter.
