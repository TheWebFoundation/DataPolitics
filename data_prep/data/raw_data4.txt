Description/notes about work: Full-service political marketing company focused
on European campaigns. They combined traditional campaigning techniques like
canvassing with more advanced databases about voters, in particular their 50+
One voter database software. Their work seems to focus more on optimizing
canvassing using data and campaign management rather than social media
campaigns. They work on both political campaigns, as well as canvassing and
surveys around political/social issues or for trade unions. Due to limitations
on data available in Europe, they generally start with data at the
neighborhood level rather than the individual level and collect additional
data through door-to-door canvassing.

including tools for managing outreach campaigns and voter databases. Most
notably, they created Ripon as part of a contract with SCL Group, which was
used as a database for Ted Cruz's campaign. They also built software for
automating advertising campaigns. Upguard found AggregateIQ's Gitlab
repository online in March 2018 and published a series of articles analyzing
their software and clients.

Description/notes about work: A data-driven political marketing company that
worked on many different campaigns around the world. Cambridge Analytica uses
data from a variety of sources combined with psychological profiles and
surveys to target advertisements. It has been at the center of recent scandals
due to the misuse of Facebook data when working on the Trump campaign.

An undercover investigation revealed that in some cases they may conceal their
involvement in elections with front companies/partner companies or use more
dubious tactics such as bribery and honey traps.  Cambridge Analytica was also
working on a cryptocurrency to enable people to sell their data to
advertisers.

Due to a series of scandals, Cambridge Analytica and many of its associated
companies were closed.  However, Cambridge Analytica is far from unique and
many other companies use similar techniques and data.
