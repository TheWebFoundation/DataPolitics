They combined traditional campaigning techniques like canvassing with more advanced databases about voters, in particular their 50+ One voter database software. Their work seems to focus more on optimizing canvassing using data and campaign management rather than social media campaigns. They work on both political campaigns, as well as canvassing and surveys around political/social issues or for trade unions. Due to limitations on data available in Europe, they generally start with data at the neighborhood level rather than the individual level and collect additional data through door-to-door canvassing.",

    "description": "A data-driven political marketing company that worked on many different campaigns around the world. Cambridge Analytica uses data from a variety of sources combined with psychological profiles and surveys to target advertisements. It has been at the center of recent scandals due to the misuse of Facebook data when working on the Trump campaign.<br />An undercover investigation revealed that in some cases they may conceal their involvement in elections with front companies/partner companies or use more dubious tactics such as bribery and honey traps.  Cambridge Analytica was also working on a cryptocurrency to enable people to sell their data to advertisers.<br />Due to a series of scandals, Cambridge Analytica and many of its associated companies were closed.  However, Cambridge Analytica is far from unique and many other companies use similar techniques and data.",
